A planned esports tournament is to be moved , after protests over the United Arab Emirates ' record on lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender issues . 

A petition signed by more than 13 , 000 listed its " serious LGBTQ + issues "  , including criminalising homosexuality . 

Publisher Ubisoft holds three Rainbow Six Siege tournaments each year . 

And the company says it will now " move the Six Major of August 2022 to another Rainbow Six esports region , with the exact location yet to be determined "  . 

In a tweet on the official Rainbow Six esport page , Ubisoft added it had heard " loud and clear that members of the international Siege community question this choice "  .

The company had initially defended the decision to stage the event in the UAE , announced on Sunday , 20 February , saying it had held extensive discussions with the UAE government and local esports partners and teams to ensure " anyone of all gender identities , sexual orientations , cultural backgrounds , or other individual traits , would be welcomed "  . 

But it immediately provoked anger from the community . 

And the petition called it " short-sighted " and " borderline insulting to our identity "  . 

One of the top esports titles , with more than 70 million registered players worldwide , Rainbow Siege has gay characters and professional players . 

Commentator Emi " Fluke " Donaldson tweeted she was " proud our community got loud "  .
