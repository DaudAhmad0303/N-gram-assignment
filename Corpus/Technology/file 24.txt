Twenty years after 3G was first introduced in the United States , paving the way for a new generation of mobile apps , the network is officially being phased out . 

AT & T is set to pull the plug on its 3G network Tuesday , with other major US carriers expected to follow suit later this year . The move impacts everything from older phones to home alarm systems and roadside assistance systems .

To move its mobile customers over to 4G without service interruptions , AT & T ( T )  , which owns CNN ' s parent company , has been providing free replacement phones to many users with a 3G device . It has also been attempting to alert customers to the network changes through various methods .  
 " For nearly two years , we ' ve proactively sent numerous communications via direct mail , bill messaging , emails and text messages to help customers transition to next generation networks before 3G services end on February 22 ,  " AT & T told CNN Business in a statement . 
AT & T is shutting down its 3G networks as part of a greater effort to re-use the spectrum for 4G and 5G â€” newer standards that are more efficient than 3G . T-Mobile ( TMUS ) will do the same in the third quarter and Verizon ( VZ ) will do so by the end of the year . 
Here ' s what you should know about the 3G shutdown . 
What products will be impacted ? 
The shutdown will impact people still using 3G Kindles , 3G flip phones , the iPhone 5 and older models as well as various Android phones . It will also affect home alarm systems and medical devices such as fall detectors . Some in-car crash notification and roadside assistance systems like OnStar will need to be updated or replaced , too . 
If you ' re not sure which network your phone is on , open Settings , tap Network and Internet , and then select Mobile Network on Android devices . On iOS , choose Settings , Cellular and then pick Cellular Data Options . AT & T also has a dedicated webpage to determine if your device will be impacted by the shut down . 
It can be harder to tell with other everyday products . If you ' re not sure whether the device relies on 3G , you can call the manufacturer or car dealer . 
What can I do about it ? 
For those who don ' t want to get rid of their 3G mobile devices , there are some workarounds . In theory , it will be possible to access a web browser via Wi-Fi or make calls over wireless on a 3G phone if the user has an app enabling voice-over-internet protocol , such as Facebook Messenger . Similarly , people with a 3G e-reader will still be able to download new books on the device via Wi-Fi . 
Other 3G products may be more complicated . My Alarm Center , a home security systems business , has warned customers that certain alarm systems will need to be replaced by a technician to avoid potential disruptions .  " Even if your alarm appears to function , it will no longer communicate with our central service station to notify us that emergency services are needed ,  " the company states on its website . 
General Motors ( GM )  , which owns OnStar , started pushing over-the-air updates in October to vehicles released as far back as 2015 , including models from Chevrolet , Buick and Cadillac , which may be impacted by the transition . As a general rule , most cars built in the last five years with connectivity are using 4G modems . If the car does run on 3G , the manufacturer may offer an upgrade program or the wireless carrier can provide an adapter with a modem that can be plugged into a vehicle . 
Why is this happening ? 
The 3G network launched in 2002 and became the driving force behind the early App Store boom around the end of that decade . The wireless companies later moved on to 4G and more recently 5G networks . 
Last month , AT & T and Verizon turned on C-band 5G networks , an important set of higher radio frequencies that will supercharge the internet . The change will allow users to , for example , stream a Netflix movie in 4K resolution or download a movie in seconds .  ( Verizon said its C-band speeds reach nearly 1 gigabyte per second , about 10 times as fast as 4G LTE .  ) 
Only a small portion of wireless customers are still using 3G networks . Verizon said in a blog post that 99% of its customers have already upgraded to 4G LTE or 5G , and AT & T said less than 1% of its mobile data traffic runs on 3G networks . T-Mobile did not respond to a request for comment about its 3G user base .
