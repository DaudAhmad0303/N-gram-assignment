Analysis showed Amenhotep I was the first pharaoh to be mummified with arms crossed and the last not to have had his brain removed from the skull . 

The tomography scan also revealed that the pharaoh , who conducted several military campaigns during his 21-year rule , had died at the age of 35 , apparently of injury or illness .
