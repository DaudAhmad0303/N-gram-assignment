this week I traveled to Chicago to
deliver my final farewell address to the
nation following in the tradition of
presidents before me it was an
opportunity to say thank you whether
we ' ve seen eye to eye or rarely agreed
at all my conversations with you the
American people in living rooms and
schools at farms and on factory floors
at diners and on distant military
outposts all these conversations are
what have kept me honest kept me
inspired and kept me going every day I
learned from you you made me a better
president and you made me a better man
over the course of these eight years
I ' ve seen the goodness the resilience
and the hope of the American people I ' ve
seen neighbors looking out for each
other as we rescued our economy from the
worst crisis of our lifetimes of hunt
cancer survivors who finally know the
security of affordable health care I ' ve
seen communities like Joplin rebuild
from disaster and cities like Boston
show the world that no terrorists will
ever break the American spirit I ' ve seen
the hopeful faces of young graduates and
our newest military officers I ' ve
mourned with grieving families searching
for answers and I found grace in a
Charleston Church I ' ve seen our
scientists help a paralyzed man regain
his sense of touch and our wounded
warriors walk again I ' ve seen our
doctors and volunteers rebuild after
earthquakes and stop pandemics in their
tracks I ' ve learned from students who
are building robots and curing diseases
and who will change the world in ways we
can ' t even imagine I ' ve seen the
youngest of children remind us of our
obligations to care for our refugees to
work in peace and above all to look out
for each other
that ' s what ' s possible when we come
together in the slow hard sometimes
frustrating but always vital work of
self-government but we can ' t take our
democracy for granted all of us
regardless of party should throw
ourselves into the work of citizenship
not just when there ' s an election not
just when our own there
interest is at stake but over the full
span of a lifetime
if you ' re tired of arguing with
strangers on the internet try to talk
with one in real life if something needs
fixing lace up your shoes and do some
organizing if you ' re disappointed by
your elected officials then grab a
clipboard get some signatures and run
for office yourself our success depends
on our participation regardless of which
way the pendulum of power swings it
falls on each of us to be guardians of
our democracy to embrace the joyous task
we ' ve been given to continually try to
improve this great nation of ours
because for all our outward differences
we all share the same proud title
citizen it has been the honor of my life
to serve you as president eight years
later I am even more optimistic about
our country ' s promise and I look forward
to working along your side as a citizen
for all my days that remain thanks
everybody
god bless you and God bless the United
States of America
you
