WE'RE HERE JOINED BY PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON.
WHEN YOU ARE IN A SPACE WHERE A CAMPAIGN IS BEING RUN, AND THIS
IS TURNING INTO ONE OF THE UGLIER CAMPAIGNS THAT WE'VE
SEEN -- YOU KNOW, A LOT OF HATEFUL RHETORIC IS COMING UP,
YOU KNOW, WHETHER IT WITH RACIAL, NATIONALISTIC, YOU KNOW,
YOU SEE THE RISE OF ULTRA RIGHT MOVEMENTS AND SO ON, A LOT OF
MISOGYNISTIC COMMENTS ABOUT YOUR WIFE -- WHEN RUNNING THAT KIND
OF RACE, WHEN YOU'RE OUT ON THE TRAIL, YOU'RE OUT THERE AS ONE
OF HILLARY'S SURROGATES.
DO YOU FEEL SOME OF THAT TENSION OR ARE YOU ONLY SEEING THE
POSITIVE SIDE OF THE RACE?
>> WELL, IF YOU GO AND HAVE RALLIES, YOU TEND TO HAVE THE
PEOPLE WHO TEND TO SHOW UP ARE FOR YOU, YOU KNOW, AND YOUR
WHOLE GOAL IS TO REGISTER MORE OF THEM AND MAKE SURE THEY
UNDERSTAND THEY HAVE TO VOTE AND TALK ABOUT ARGUMENTS THAT THEY
CAN MAKE TO OTHER PEOPLE, BUT FOR MOST OF MY LIFE, EACH
POLITICAL PARTY HAD A 40% BASE, AND THEN THERE WERE 20%, THEY
WERE GENUINELY UP FOR GRABS, BY THE TIME THE 2000 RACE CAME
ALONG BETWEEN AL GORE AND PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH, IT WAS
PROBABLY DOWN TO TEN.
IT MAY BE DOWN TO LESS NOW.
BECAUSE WE'RE GETTING SILOED.
WE ARE SILOED IN THE TV SHOWS WE WATCH AND THE WEB SITES WE SCAN,
EVERYTHING.
AMERICA'S COME SO FAR, WE'RE LESS RACIST, SEXIST, HOMOPHOBIC
AND ANTI-RELIGIOUS -- SPECIFIC RELIGIONS THAN WE USED TO BE.
WE HAVE ONE REMAINING BIGOTRY, WE DON'T WANT TO BE AROUND
ANYONE WHO DISAGREES WITH US.
( LAUGHTER ) THE CROWD IS LAUGHING BUT THEY
DIDN'T LAUGH LOUD BECAUSE THEY KNOW I'M TELLING THE TRUTH.
( LAUGHTER ) >> Trevor: ONE OF THE BIGGEST
THINGS THAT HAS COME UP OVER AND OVER IN THIS CAMPAIGN IS DO YOU
WANT MORE OF THE SAME OR AN OUTSIDER, A MAN WHO DOESN'T
BELIEVE IN LOGIC AND IDEAS -- ( LAUGHTER )
-- SOMEONE WHO THINKS DIFFERENTLY.
IT APPEARS -- >> THAT'S ACTUALLY ACCURATE.
( LAUGHTER ) >> Trevor: IT APPEARS THERE
ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO SEEM TO WANT THAT.
IT APPEARS THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO SAY THIS IS WHAT I
NEED.
NOW, YOU ARE IN THE UNIQUE POSITION.
PRESIDENT OBAMA MANY TIMES ON THE TRAIL HAS SAID YOU DON'T
KNOW WHATTETH LIKE UNTIL YOU SIT BEHIND THAT DESK, UNTIL YOU HAVE
TO MAKE THOSE DECISIONS.
EXPERIENCE IS TOUTED AS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS.
YOU YOURSELF, THOUGH, CAME IN AS SOMEWHAT OF AN OUTSIDER, SO THE
QUESTION THEN IS WHAT IS THE MOST EXPERIENCE?
WHAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING, IS IT THE EXPERIENCE OR
THE WILLINGNESS TO DO SOMETHING?
WHAT SHOULD AN AMERICAN VOTER BE LOOKING FOR FOR THE BEST
OUTCOME?
>> WELL, FIRST, I HAD AN ADVANTAGE.
I HAD NEVER BEEN IN OFFICE IN WASHINGTON, BUT I WAS -- AND I
WAS YOUNG, BUT I WAS THE LONGEST-SERVING GOVERNOR IN
AMERICA.
SO I HAD HAD A LOT OF EXECUTIVE EXPERIENCE.
I THINK THAT BOTH THESE CANDIDATES HAVE HAD A LOT OF
EXPERIENCES AND MADE DECISIONS, THE DECISIONS HAD CONSEQUENCES.
THERE IS A RECORD OF THEM.
SO SAYING SHE'S AN INSIDER, I'M AN OUTSIDER, THERE'S ONE BIG
DIFFERENCE, MOST OF HER STRONGEST SUPPORTERS ARE PEOPLE
WHO HAVE WORKED FOR HER OR HAVE DONE BUSINESS WITH HIM.
THEY'RE FOR HER, TOO.
( LAUGHTER ) MOST OF HIS STRONGEST SUPPORTERS
ARE I'M AGAINST THIS ADMINISTRATION, I JUST WANT
SOMETHING NEW, AND I DON'T LIKE ALL THESE CHANGES.
I WANT TO COME INSIDE AND CLOSE THE DOOR.
LOOK, I GET THAT.
THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO FEEL ECONOMICALLY OR CULTURALLY
DISPOSSESSED, THEY WANT TO COME, IN CLOSE THE DOOR.
THAT'S THE BREXIT VOTE IN THE U.K.
SO WHAT I THINK IS IMPORTANT IS THE PROVEN RECORD OF MAKING GOOD
DECISIONS THAT MAKE GOOD THINGS HAPPEN FOR OTHER PEOPLE -- THE
PEOPLE THAT WORK FOR YOU, THE PEOPLE THAT YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO
SERVE, THAT'S WHAT I THINK IS IMPORTANT.
>> Trevor: DO YOU GET AFRAID SOMETIMES WHEN YOU SEE THE
HATEFUL RHETORIC?
>> SURE.
LOOK, I AM A PRODUCT OF WHAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE HILARY'S
OPPONENTS' BASE -- THE NON-COLLEGE EDUCATED, SMALL TOWN
AND RURAL, WHITE WORKING CLASS.
I WAS THE FIRST PERSON IN MY FAMILY TO EVER GO TO COLLEGE.
I'LL PROBABLY BE THE LAST PRESIDENT TO EVER LIVE ON A
SMALL FARM WITHOUT INDOOR PLUMBING.
IT'S GOOD POLITICS, IT'S A TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE.
( LAUGHTER ) IN THE WINTER THE OUTHOUSE IS
OVERRATED.
IN THE SUMMER WHEN THE SNAKES COME OUT, IT IS.
BUT I KNOW HOW FRAGILE IT IS, AND I WATCHED UNSCRUPULOUS
POLITICIANS PLAY MY PEOPLE FROM THE TIME I WAS A LITTLE BOY.
ALL THE RACISM THAT WAS INSPIRED OVER THE INTEGRATION OF LITTLE
ROCK CENTRAL HIGH SCHOOL IN ARKANSAS, EVERYBODY LOOKING FOR
SOMEBODY ELSE TO BLAME.
SURELY TO GOD THERE IS SOME WAY WE CAN BE JUST A LITTLE BIT
MADDER THAN WE ARE NOW, JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE DIVIDED, AND YET
THE PEOPLE I COME FROM, FOR ALL THEIR ANGER, THEY PROVIDED
ABOUT -- THE SCOTT-IRISH PROTESTANTS MADE UP 25% OF THE
PEOPLE SERVING THIS COUNTRY GOING BACK TO THE REVOLUTION.
IF YOUR HOUSE WAS ON FIRE YOU WOULD WANT THEM IN YOUR
NEIGHBORHOOD BECAUSE THEY WOULD RUN IN, SAVE YOUR KID AND PUT
THE FIRE OUT.
BUT THEY'RE BEING PLAYED NOW BECAUSE THEIR INCOMES ARE DOWN.
THERE ARE TWO COUNTIES IN WEST VIRGINIA WHERE THE NUMBER
ONE SOURCE OF INCOME IS A DISABILITY CHECK.
THIS IS THE FIRST DRUG EPIDEMIC IN MY LIFETIME WHERE THE
ADDICTION RATES ARE HIGHEST IN SMALL TOWN IN RURAL AMERICA.
I JUST TRY TO THINK ABOUT WHAT TO DO ABOUT THIS BECAUSE I'M NOT
IN POLITICS ANYMORE, AND I THINK THE ONLY WAY TO SOOTHE PEOPLE'S
PAIN IS TO GIVE THEM A POSITIVE RESPONSE THAT CONSTITUTES
ANSWERS NOT ANGER AND EMPOWERMENT, NOT RESENTMENT.
I THINK THAT'S THE ANSWER.
BUT I GET WHAT WE'RE GOING THROUGH, AND SO FAR NOTHING HAS
HAPPENED WILL SURPRISE ME.
BUT WE HAVE -- IF I WERE 25 AGAIN, THAT'S LIKE MAKE AMERICA
GREAT AGAIN, I WOULD LIKE TO BE --
( LAUGHTER ) -- BUT I WOULDN'T VOTE FOR
ANYBODY WHO WOULD PROMISE TO MAKE ME 25 AGAIN.
( LAUGHTER ) BUT, ANYWAY, IF I WERE AND
SOMEBODY SAID YOU CAN BE WHEREVER YOU WANT TO BE 30 YEARS
FROM NOW BUT YOU HAVE TO DECIDE RIGHT NOW, I WOULD PICK AMERICA
BECAUSE WE'RE BETTER POSITIONED.
BUT IF WE GIVE INTO THIS LOWEST COMMON DENOMINATOR, EVERYBODY IS
OUR ENEMY, TELL ME SOMETHING BAD ABOUT IT OR I DON'T WANT TO
KNOW, LET'S DIVIDE AND DEMEAN AND DEMONIZE, WE COULD BLOW IT
ALL, AND WE COULD LEAD THE WORLD IN A VERY DIFFERENT DIRECTION.
THAT'S WHY THE ELECTION IS SO IMPORTANT AND WHY, YOU KNOW,
I'VE TRIED TO MAKE THE CHANGES IN THE FOUNDATION THAT YOU
TALKED ABOUT SO THAT PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT BEING PRESIDENT
IS A WHOLE DIFFERENT KETTLE OF FISH THAN BEING SECRETARY OF
STATE.
IF I HAD MADE A MISTAKE FOR EXAMPLE ON THESE FOREIGN
DONATIONS, THERE IS ALWAYS AN APPEAL TO THE WHITE HOUSE, THE
PRESIDENT COULD ALWAYS SAY, NO, I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD DO
THAT.
BUT IF SHE BECOMES PRESIDENT, I WOULD JUST NOT TAKE FOREIGN
MONEY, NOT TAKE CORPORATE MONEY, FARM OUT ALL OUR INTERNATIONAL
OPERATIONS TO OTHERS AND I'M IN THE PROCESS OF DOING THAT, MAKE
THOSE THAT SHOULD STAY TOGETHER INDEPENDENT OF ME, AND REMOVE
ALL QUESTIONS OF CONFLICTS, I THINK WE CAN DO THAT.
BUT THE MAIN THING IS THE MODEL THAT WE PIONEERED IS THE WAY WE
OUGHT TO RUN THE COUNTRY.
WE OUGHT TO GET EVERYBODY TOGETHER, AGREE ON WHAT YOU'RE
GOING TO DO AND MAKE SOMETHING GOOD HAPPEN.
THAT'S WAY BETTER THAN ALL THIS CONSTANT FIGHTING, AND IT MAY
MEAN YOU WILL HAVE TO LOOK ELSEWHERE FOR JOKES ON THE "THE
DAILY SHOW."
( LAUGHTER ) >> Trevor: THAT'S A GOOD
PROBLEM TO HAVE.
>> I TRIED TO GIVE YOU THAT HIGH-CLASS PROBLEM, I DO WHAT
YICAN.
>> Trevor: THAT'S A GOOD PROBLEM.
( LAUGHTER ) I COULD TALK TO YOU FOREVER.
YOU'RE AMAZING.
YOU'RE ONE OF THE HAPPIER PEOPLE ON THE TRAIL.
I DID THINK ABOUT -- >> GO FIGURE.
>> Trevor: -- WHAT GIFT I COULD GIVE YOU FOR COMING TO THE
SHOW.
I REALLY DO APPRECIATE IT AND I THOUGHT, YOU ARE THE MAN WHO HAS
EVERYTHING FROM PEOPLE TO INFLUENCE, AND I DID NOTICE
THERE IS ONE THING THAT MAKES YOU SMILE, SO I WANTED TO GIVE
YOU THE GIFT OF BALLOONS.
SO -- ( LAUGHTER )
SO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING TO "THE DAILY SHOW."
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( LAUGHTER )
YAY!
>> WHEN I SAW THE FILM AT THE END OF THE CONVENTION, I
REALIZED THAT MORE THAN ANYBODY ELSE, I WAS THERE PLAYING WITH
THE BALLOONS AND THEY WERE GOING TO HOOK ME OFF THE STAGE, I
THOUGHT, YOU KNOW, I REALLY AM IN MY SECOND CHILDHOOD.
( LAUGHTER ) >> Trevor: THANK YOU SO MUCH.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Trevor: PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON, EVERYBODY!
