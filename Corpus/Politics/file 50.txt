and that was the W ' s Naomi Conrad
reporting from the Pakistani city of
Lahore with me in the studio now it ' s a
pleasure to welcome Pakistan ' s
ambassador to the Federal Republic of
Germany Joe Salim welcome to you
ambassador now we all agreed that you
know a free press is critical for a
democratic system and yet we saw that
report some journalists in Pakistan do
not feel safe to speak why is the press
being intimidated ahead of this election
I ' m retired I could say you know I wish
I could say that I was amused by this
report what I saw but I ' m not actually
was unfortunate because it ' s quite a
sort of quite a misperception and I see
all those myths upset misperceptions
being spread in international media now
somebody like me who knows Pakistan ' s
democracy who ' s been there as a student
as you know he struggled India zero for
pro-democracy movements and ever since
we have seen this martial democracy in
Pakistan and I can tell you that this
election will bring more democracy to
Pakistan it ' s going to be away free and
fair elections even fearful fairness
that organization which has a four
hundred and Jews in it
forty thousand observers mr . ambassador
may interrupt you know all of us as
journalists are following developments
in Pakistan there ' s been huge criticism
off the media crackdown you have
channels which have been taken off where
you have newspapers which have been shut
down
you have journalists who ' ve been
abducted and have gone missing that
doesn ' t speak of a very open and free
atmosphere for reporting in Pakistan you
know these are kind of generalizations
you pick two or three sporadic incidents
and then you try to just make some kind
of deductions out of it some conclusions
out of it
which probably suits certain quarters
but the fact of the matter is I ' ll cut
one a very interesting interview
recently there was this present of a
pianist in all Pakistan in a news
Association Journalists Association but
and by BBC hot talk and in that
interview Steve asked him he said give
us some evidence some specifics okay let
me give you one evidence here for
example you ' re one of the organizations
in Pakistan the human
it ' s Commission of Pakistan and a direct
quote for them reaffirms the public
perception that all parties have not
been given equal freedom to run their
election campaigns candidates from
parties such as the pml-n
that is Nawaz Sharif ' s party the former
prime minister the PPP which is form of
Benazir Bhutto ' s party and the Avani
Workers Party have reported being
harassed by law enforcement and security
personnel during their campaigns now it
is one of your own Pakistani
organizations making these claims given
that what kind of free and fair election
can you have now well I was quoting frif
and like I said this is just one - is a
conglomerate of 400 of NGOs and at
40 , 000 observers in the last elections
in 2013 and you know what fear Francaise
fear Francaise 90% of the politicians
believe more than 90% actually that is a
level playing field for everyone there
you know so HRC P okay these
unfortunately some of these
organizations in Pakistan they get
partial sometimes and but every day why
would they turn posh let me take another
look which you would say partial the
military the role of the military
there ' s a huge perception within
independent press in Pakistan as well as
outside that the Army is playing a
critical role in this election and some
even say it is actually making sure that
it ' s favored candidate Imran Khan a
stock cricketer a critically a cricket
star and now a politician is there
trying to ensure that he comes to power
I ' ve read those reports as well but let
me tell you something if some you know
on the day of the election there ' ll be a
hundred million people voting and these
300 , 000 military that you mentioned
they ' ll be there just to ensure that and
this has happened in the previous
elections as well by the way you know
there are security threats in Pakistan
there there they have been those bomb
attacks and everything we cannot have
election in a climate of fear so they
will ensure that it does not happen so
if anybody thinks that they can hijack
elections from those hundred thousand
people when we have had electoral
reforms which will make sure that this
election is much more transparent than
the previous any any of the previous
elections
I have no doubt in my mind that there ' s
no possibility that there ' s no intent
there ' s no will in any quarters and I
think this is part of sort of you know
look what happens in Pakistan if
somebody is caught for corruption and
this is happening after that these are
criticism coming from within Pakistan
not just from outside so obviously there
seems to be some perception there that
the military is trying to influence
elections and you ' re saying the military
is there to bring security to some
extent that the military will intimidate
voters into voting in one direction at
all I think military is there first of
all to bring security because there ' s no
climate affair second of all I think a
lot of things that have taken place
recently and those are unprecedented in
Pakistan people always used to say that
the corrupt never get punished
particularly the white-collar crime the
rich you know but that is happening now
and that is very important because you
cannot have democracy without
accountability that ' s right and that is
where the problem actually lies
accountability and when you talk about
corruption many would say that it ' s
being selectively there applied against
political targets I don ' t just mean one
a Finals on that yeah people from PTI
Imran Khan ' s but people from pml-n
people from people ' s parties the dirty
spot across the board the accountability
is happening so then final question for
you ambassador dinner extremist parties
are also contesting this election to
give you one example and Hafiz Muhammad
aside he ' s one of the people who ' s
implicated in the Mumbai masterminded
the Mumbai attacks his party and her new
name is also contesting elections are
you worried that extremist parties may
become part of the mainstream after this
election I ' m Rita let me tell you
something we are here in Berlin in this
city their streets named after people
who were militants and then they became
mainstream politicians and then they
actually got Nobel Prize for Peace you
know so the point is I mean if they ' re
certain let ' s say they ' re certain
organizations who disavow violence who
want to then work within the
Constitution and you know within the
Constitution anybody you know can
profess whatever believes they have
which are not
not inciting anybody for violence not
trying to break the Constitution in any
way yeah land and that people decide
this has happened in many parts of the
world and these are of you know these
are not sort of you know a tip you know
mumbay attacks I can go on on on the on
that you know there are lots of Sara
funeral like question marks about
India ' s role in that so let ' s not talk
about that but the point is that in
Pakistan it ' s not the militants who are
allowed you know who are being allowed
to contesting elections it ' s actually
the people who had let ' s say at some
point extremist ideologies but then they
disavowed those that are ideologies they
want to be part of the mainstream
politics so why shouldn ' t we they be
given this chance okay interesting topic
lots of controversial issues thank you
for answering a lot of those questions
Jorah Saleem Pakistan ' s ambassador to
Germany it was a pleasure to have you
thank you for having me here
