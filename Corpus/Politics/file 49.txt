Pakistan ' s prime minister Imran Khan has
said that Narendra Modi has committed a
strategic blunder and will have to pay a
heavy price for his actions in
indian-administered Kashmir speaking on
Pakistan ' s independence day the Premier
was referring to New Delhi ' s move to
scrap article 370 of the Indian
Constitution which gave partial autonomy
to the Indian administered state of
Jammu and Kashmir
now mr . Khan ' s comments have come as
India says that security has been eased
in hindu-majority Jammu but will
continue in the mainly Muslim Kashmir
Valley for an unspecified time to remind
you for past 10 days we ' ve seen this
part of Kashmir and lockdown
thousands of extra security forces have
been patrolling the streets telephone
and Internet services have been
suspended protests banned and leaders
locked up well let ' s take you straight
to secunda Kimani who is in more suffer
bad for us that is the capital of
Pakistani administered Kashmir where
everyone has been listening I imagined
Imran Khan speak today Secunda tell us
what he said yes that ' s why I ' m Ron Khan
was just speaking this building behind
me the local parliament in Pakistani
administered Kashmir and really coming
here today he had at least two audiences
in mind a domestic one and an
international one when it comes to
Pakistanis and those living in here in
pakistan-administered Kashmir he
promised them that he would be the voice
for the Kashmiri cause taking it up on
every available forum when it came to
the international community
he had a warning he said that the United
Nations needed to intervene in this
growing crisis in Kashmir the Kashmir
region is of course disputed between
both Pakistan and India and Imran Khan
had a message as well for Indian Prime
Minister Narendra Modi he said that his
actions in indian-administered Kashmir
would proved to be a crucial blunder
that wants this de facto curfew that ' s
in place was was lifted then all kinds
of activities would start again we would
learn about some alleged atrocities
potentially by the Indian Armed Forces
and there would be an up
rising really of some sort in
indian-administered Kashmir I mean we
could read so much into his words that
could endure and he ' s only just spoken
but he also said to India we will
respond to whatever you do we will go
until the end what does he mean by that
well look at the moments it ' s very clear
Pakistani officials want to appear the
reasonable ones in talking about taking
military action they ' re talking about a
diplomatic offensive they have said and
Imran Khan as you say did say here just
a few minutes moments ago that were
India to take any action military action
against Pakistan or against Pakistani
administered Kashmir
that he would respond in with military
force to any Indian attack but certainly
the moment the Pakistani authorities are
being very careful to to emphasize that
they ' re trying to take the diplomatic
route at the moment and seconda how our
people have more suffer a bad feeling
about what is happening with their cash
marry brothers well certainly for people
in Pakistan and in particularly in
Pakistani administered Kashmir the
Kashmiri causes is a deeply emotive one
generations of Pakistanis have grown up
believing that Kashmir should be part of
Pakistan orally
dependent and certainly shouldn ' t be
part of I was here about just a few
typical people speaking finally we seem
to be having a few problems to Secunda
in a more suffer about as you can
imagine difficulties with communications
at times like this but we can take you
to rotund and monitoring events for us
from Delhi and I ' m just wondering Rahul
there was some fiery language from Imran
Khan has there been any reaction in
India not yet and I don ' t think that the
authorities in Delhi will be surprised
about what the Prime Minister of
Pakistan has said we may get a response
from the Indian Prime Minister Narendra
Modi when he addresses his nation
tomorrow on Indian Independence Day but
during the course of this week Lucy
we ' ve had briefings from senior
Indian government officials who ' ve made
it categorically clear that this is an
internal matter for the Indian
government it is none of the business of
Pakistan is the language that they use
and also they ' ve been keen to point out
that look when it comes to relations
between the two countries at the moment
they say it ' s Pakistan who has decided
to cut off train links it ' s Pakistan
who ' s tried to cut off the bus links as
well India at the moment says we have no
problems with those so they I think
they ' re trying to put the blame for any
increase in tensions across the border
but there ' ll be no surprise with Imran
Khan ' s comments at all today and I ' m
sure mr . Modi will make his response
tomorrow well we ' re seeing pictures of
empty streets soldiers on those streets
as well and Kashmir what do we know
about the lifting of some of those
security restrictions that were
announced today we know that in the
Hindu area of Jammu that the
restrictions on movement have been
lifted but in the valley which is where
the predominantly Muslim population of
that area lives the restrictions are as
severe if not more severe than ever
before at the moment as India moves
towards Indian Independence Day so once
again as we ' ve been saying throughout
the last 10 days there ' s two very
differing narratives here the Indians
say it ' s peaceful not too many problems
but what we hear from the ground is
seething anger and in the last hour
we ' re getting reports to chow fest a
loser
Kashmiri politician who was on hard talk
on the BBC world
yesterday evening has been picked up and
detained as he tried to leave the
country in an emotional interview with
Stephen soccer yesterday he said the
people of Kashmir had been betrayed and
also that the removal of autonomy was an
insult so still many people in detention
and still we wait to really hear the
voice of the people of
indian-administered Kashmir was the
Indian say the vast majority they are
supporting their actions well it was
very good to see you and thank you for
teeing up our very next piece of
interview Rahul there talking about that
Kashmir politician who gave an interview
to the BBC ' s Steven Sokka and that hard
talk program in the interview as Rahul
was saying faisal shah of Jammu Kashmir
is people movement told Stevenson
that he was apprehensive of his arrest
and as Rahal was just saying he has now
been arrested herb listen stop the
political leaders who belong to my
political party and all other political
parties have been detained I am the only
person from the all party meeting which
met there in Srinagar on 4th who ' s free
and honestly speaking I ' m ashamed of
myself that I ' m free at a time when the
entire leadership of Kashmir is under
you know in jail and all the eight
million people have been imprisoned do
you think in all honesty when this
interview is done and perhaps over the
next few days you will try to go back to
Kashmir do you think you will be free
for long police has come to my home
couple of times after I left and it ' s
also a story in itself the way I reached
Airport and and came to Delhi because of
communication breakdown maybe people
could not communicate to their
higher-ups about my escape from the
airport but I am very much apprehensive
that soon after I leave from here I may
be detained like anybody else
so prophetic words there Faisal Shah has
now been arrested
