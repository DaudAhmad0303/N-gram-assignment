( CNN ) If the election were held today , Democrats would not only lose control of the House , but suffer massive losses in their ranks . 

That ' s the conclusion that should be drawn from new ABC News / Washington Post polling that shows a generic Republican candidate leading a generic Democratic one by a 49% to 42% margin among registered voters nationally .  ( That gap expands to 13 points when you limit the sample to registered voters who say they are " certain " to vote .  ) 
That ' s known as the generic ballot test . For decades , it ' s been a reliable weathervane as to which way -- and how hard -- the partisan winds are blowing . 
And what the ABC / Post poll makes clear is that the wind is blowing against the Democrats -- and hard . 
How bad is it for Democrats ? Consider where the generic ballot stood in ABC / Post polling taken just before other recent midterm elections : 
2018 : D + 7 on generic ballot ( Democrats won a net of 40 House seats ) 
2014 : D + 3 ( Democrats lost a net of 13 seats ) 
2010 : D + 5 ( Democrats lost a net of 64 seats ) 
2006 : D + 13 ( Democrats won a net of 31 seats ) 
What ' s clear is that when the Democratic edge is five points or less on the generic ballot , the party has experienced major seat losses in midterm elections . 
Now consider what the House playing field might look like with a Republican edge of seven points on the generic ballot .  ( Among independent voters , largely considered the swing votes in elections , Republicans have a 14-point edge on the generic ballot in the latest ABC / Post poll .  ) 
Like I said : Catastrophic . 
Now , the counter-argument goes like this : 
1 ) It ' s February 2022 , not November 2022 . 
2 ) Redistricting across the country has severely constricted the number of competitive seats between the two parties . 
3 ) After Republicans gained a net of 12 House seats in 2020 , there is less low-hanging fruit out there . 
All true ! And it still might not matter . 
The Point : Political waves tend to wash away members of Congress who looked safe and sound just a few months earlier . And if the generic ballot stays anywhere close to where it is today , Democrats could be facing a historically large wave .
