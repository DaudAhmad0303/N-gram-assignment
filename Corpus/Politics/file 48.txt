islamic you're watching views and news
and i'm festive on live from our
islamabad studios earlier you were
listening to the prime minister of
pakistan mr imran khan and interestingly
some great packages
have been announced by the pm
i think hats off to the current
government regarding the decree
in the oil and petroleum products and
amazingly 10 rupees per liter has been
slashed whereas the entire globe is
expecting that the fuel prices will go
further up in the coming days and rather
coming weeks because of the ukrainian
crisis and the
shortage as far as the production is
concerned and perhaps a lot more than
that also another great announcement
again despite the fact that ogra the
other day announced that there could be
an increase in the electricity prices by
rupees six per unit whereas what we
heard from the prime minister was the
opposite he said that five rupees will
be reduced per
unit so that is i think a great news for
not only uh the domestic consumers or
perhaps for the
people who are into the field of
industry i think their cost of
production is definitely going to go
down
another important factor now how the imf
is going to react to it because they had
in fact advised that the petroleum levy
and the petroleum prices should be
increased whereas there should be more
increase as far as the electricity is
concerned a srs program in fact which
has received
international acclaim
prices have been increased there as well
and when you talk about per family
i think there is a huge uh
difference that will be seen because it
has been appreciated by all the
financial institutions as well as by a
lot of countries also
when you talk about safeguard i was
surprised to know during these uh
cricket matches when psl was being held
that this is the largest in fact benefit
given to any uh country by the
government
interestingly
one million rupees you can go to any
government hospital or perhaps you can
choose to go to a private uh hospital or
a clinic there as well
for a family
10 million uh one million this is 10
lakh rupees is is amazing uh awareness
you also spoke about the growth rate
that we've achieved that is around 5.3
percent despite the fact while the
entire globe was under a lot of pressure
and the pressure was primarily because
of corona and the supplies i'll just
give you one example that a 20-foot
container that used to cost around 4 200
is being booked at 20 000 now so you can
well imagine uh what has been going on
and other than that as far as foreign
policy is concerned he talked about that
also he in fact mentioned about his
recent visit to russia prime prior to
that he was in china i think the top
leaders of the world
they met the prime minister and i think
pakistan is now in a different league
altogether people a lot of uh
from various countries especially from
india they criticize that pakistan is
always carrying a begging bowl and
perhaps they do not have any say and
as far as their foreign policy is
concerned
they they have nowhere to go but i think
it's the opposite pakistan has
registered its name among those
countries which matter not only to china
not only to russia not only to european
union perhaps to americans even now
despite the fact that we know that the
americans are having a strategic kind of
relationship with the indians
but having said that i think pakistan
has a major
global role to play now
now interestingly we'll be talking about
that let me quickly introduce you to our
panelists and today we have both the
panelists on skype we have with us uh
from germany mr harley slanderer he's a
political analyst uh thank you so much
mr slander for your time and we also
have with us
dr
jameel khansa former ambassador senior
diplomat sir pleasure to have you in the
show gentlemen thank you so much for
your time now talking about uh a quick
uh recap of the prime minister's speech
jamil sub let me start off from you
sir couple of great news for the nation
i would say reduction and significant
reduction in the petroleum prices a very
significant reduction in the electricity
prices
and we have with us radha right now uh
shakka tarinsab the finance minister
with us on the telephone line things are
pleasure to have you in the show sir
thank you so much for your time now
talking about two great news for the
nation one is about the reduction in the
petroleum prices a very significant one
10 rupees almost 12. they have been
slashed whereas the ogre opted for a
different option as far as electricity
is concerned
we were expecting 10 rupees per unit to
be increased rather it has been the
opposite five rupees has been slashed
now you talk about the safeguard you
talk about the srs program so brilliant
ideas let's talk about that your take
yeah of course you see uh
uh
we have realized that you know people
people have been under pressure because
of this commodity super cycle
and as international petroleum prices
have gone up lg prices have gone up
they put you know a lot of pressure on
you know on pakistan because we import
all these things
so i think you know
in a major departure
from what we have been doing and what
other governments have been doing around
the world
we basically have just
said that uh
let's give you know people of
pakistan a relief
although you know our petrol prices are
much lower than you know the other
countries
uh for example you know our
litter cost is 159
and india is 260
but still i mean you know
we thought that
people are suffering
so the ogre summary was that we should
increase this by nine rupees and 41
passes
so that meant that you know this should
have gone up to a hundred and
68
uh rupees
uh
but we reduced it to 149 so just imagine
we just slashed it right only
exactly also
we have we have also said that they will
remain the same
you know
for the next four months but that's more
significant you know
one time you know you know reduction we
just did you know we did not increase
two weeks ago
the price of
petroleum
but that was one time now we are saying
for four months people
can leave a sigh of relief
that the petrol prices will not go up uh
you know for next four months and we are
hoping that the the super cycle you know
starts ebbing
once you know the heat or ukraine you
know
subsides and you know the super cycle
just goes down
you know
by by the summer
the second one is you know obviously
electricity and electricity is also
dependent on the petroleum and
the 60 of our you know electricity
produced by
hydrocarbons
so it means that uh
uh
it it would have
increased you know especially the
quarterly adjustments would have
increased
but we have not only not not increased
we have reduced you know by a for you
know for 95 of population
the cost has gone down by 20 to 50
percent you know
so these are significant but more
we also have done other things like this
internship program for
graduates you know
you know
we've introduced that we have we will be
talking with these large corporates who
basically have made a lot of money and
will tell them to just increase the
salary of their employees by at least 15
to 20
we have again you know you know that the
pakistan program which was limited to
kp and uh
i think we are launching from you know
the day after tomorrow
whole of pakistan which we will disperse
minimum for 100 to 150 billion in one
year
and around 400 billion in two years
and these are interest-free loans you
know for aggregate for agriculture
for business for house homes
and so i think and then kamiyah
assassins again increases this type of
from 12 000 to 14 000.
so all these things and this this
obviously you add on the
universal health
uh insurance
so all these things you know
we we
point towards prime minister saying that
he always says two things he says i want
to
create a welfare state
and i want to make sure that you know we
have rule of law
so this is all towards that now teresa i
think that is a great relief but if i
could ask you a question here and that
is regarding the imf because whenever we
talk about imf we've been doing so many
shows on that particular issue
we always hear that imf dictates terms
and conditions and they make sure that
whatever they want should be done now so
it's the other way round that's what we
see right now regarding the petroleum
prices and the electricity prices and uh
since the
prime minister has promised that they
will remain unchanged for the next four
months four months now looking at the
ukrainian crisis or otherwise the way
the petroleum products are going up over
one hundred dollars of barrel now and
same the cases with furnace oil that we
import soda cases with so many other
commodities that we import uh soda cases
with the supply chain also as you just
mentioned rightly
about the commodity super cycle now uh
uh finance ministers up tell us
that are we in a financial position to
in fact
retain that for the next four months
because this is the real relief
for the general public sir
you know we are we have not we have not
violated anything we have promised the
imf
we will deliver the fiscal deficit which
we have
promised we are not going to increase
our debt
i mean all this is through savings
in different programs so we have decided
that you know instead of building few
roads
i mean you might as well just basically
give a relief to your to your population
and and similarly you know we have cut
corners in different uh you know
expenses
and this is you know homegrown
so i should not have any problem because
all they are saying is
that you know your your expense
uh you know
should be under control which which will
be under control
and so we don't we don't see any problem
with the animal and we have
already
think so one more important point uh
tareensa if you could listen to me and
that is about the youth obviously sir
youth is the
i think that is the most important
ingredient
especially when you talk about that 65
of our population is perhaps well under
the age of 30. now so
demographic dividend or demographic
disaster now you are talking about the
dividend here so you talking about a
huge sum 100 250 and later on by the
next year it could go up to 400 billion
rupees uh for the kamiya pakistan or
kamiyap javan program sir
entrepreneurship is something that
actually is the backbone of an economy
so how do you see that so do you believe
that we have that kind of conducive
environment and that kind of a support
system and the ecosystem that exists uh
which can really
flourish and make people believe in
themselves and grow
the very fact is that this is a program
which is very well structured
initially there were apprehensions by
imf and the world bank
and once we have seen it work
because we had the pilot and kpk and
balochistan
azad kashmir and gilgam islam
and we've seen that that it is seamless
it is very transparent totally based on
marriage
and they're very impressed and as a
matter of fact you know there is no
government intervention except you know
that we are going to be
giving you know the subsidies which are
to be given
to these uh
ngos and
non-banking financial institutions who
are going to be distributing these loans
uh and by the way these these
institutions have been doing it with the
last 30 years and their
loss ratios are just one to two percent
which means their recoveries are 98 to
99
that's really it's a very very well
thought out you know
uh i mean uh kind of initiative
and uh you know the fact is that we are
we are helping
the uh
you know the farmer we are helping you
know
uh
the people that the lord start out do
their own business
actually what we are trying to do uh
is that we want people to catch
i want to teach them how to catch fish
not want to give them fish and that is
what will
galvanize
the lower you know strata
of our you know population will make
entrepreneurs out of them and this is
going to be a very very unique
experiment you know amongst the
the developing nations i don't think
even in the developed nations they have
programs like this so we if we can hit
the 4 million you know households
in the next four or five years
and and then you know then then and then
go up to six million and eight million
and create entrepreneurship over there
that's what what will change the
destination of ours that's how the
economies grow that's how the country is
progress it's a quick question regarding
the i.t i think another brilliant
initiative taken by the prime minister
because this is the future so we are all
talking about the artificial
intelligence just imagine one single
application
in usa that was created in the silicon
valley is worth over a trillion
dollars just imagine this is the kind of
strength one can have
but i think the prime minister has done
a great uh i think
he's taken a brilliant step regarding
that tell us about that quickly sir and
the last question uh would be
about uh
the future growth plan sir if you could
talk about it
okay
firstly i just
i chair this uh committee on i.t and so
my view is that pakistan is you know
survival lies
in you know
growing i.t because
you know
we have a
major gap between imports and exports
our exports are going to grow but so so
would our imports
so what is going to grow much faster
than our imports is going to be i.t and
frankly also tourism because tourism
also you know we have you know beautiful
you know kind of areas which we can
exploit so
let's stick to the i.t
so i've just basically told you know i
asked the i.t people
that you grew by you know around 47 last
year
this year you're going to grow by 75
tell me
if you i want you to grow by 100 year on
year for the next you know
many many years
so what do you want me to do and they
said these two things at least
and so you know i just told the prime
minister please announce we will give
them taxes we will give them
uh allow them to you know open foreign
accounts and and frankly have freedom
so i think
why because i believe that you know in
five to six years time
we could hit 50 billion dollars of
exports
and if we uh by then if our remittances
are around you know
50 million uh
around you know 40 million dollars
then you know between the two of them
there will be 90 million dollars and you
know if the
uh export of goods
is another you know you know
60 70 million dollars i mean you could
be at you know
probably 160 170 billion dollars
and i think that we will be a major
exporting country
we we hope and we pray and we believe
last question sir since whenever we talk
about the economic growth normally a
digit comes in our mind six percent 5.5
percent but the two major factors and
those are about the social development
one is health one is education as far as
health is concerned i think safeguard is
a brilliant program when you talk about
education we just learned that a lot of
uh internships would be given a lot of
loans would be given to the students
also
now sir one thing that is about like we
used to have these polly technical
institutes where skillful workers were
prepared
not only for domestic consumption but
for export also any program regarding
that sir
nation
develops you know without developing the
human resource
as you said i think at the start that
you know we have
a youth bulge which can
be a winner for us or it can also sink
us
so the very fact is that we want to have
you know population dividend
and we have to take care of our you know
population the human resource japan
after all and if you see singapore and a
few other countries they only have human
resources they don't have
material resources and they are you know
one of the
most successful economies
so we will have to take care of our
human resource
develop it
and then and make sure that they help
the country now you talked about the
growth
the final question was you know what
goal do i think about the world i think
we are growing this economy is growing
if we i remove these the uh
shadows of the super cycle commodity
super cycle
we probably growing around you know
close to five percent
we have to start you know making it you
know
uh
more sustainable
and we have to make it sustainable we
have to increase our savings rate
we have to break the gap between reports
and exports and we have to make the more
productive
industry and we are working on all those
initiatives
all the best thank you
now
the next topic that is about the crisis
in europe
and a lot of development has taken place
over a period of uh a few days and uh
now
fighting is going on in ukraine as we
all know but the good news is that there
are talks that are scheduled at the uh
ukrainian and belarusian border where
the ukrainian uh deputy foreign minister
along with the defense minister will be
meeting the cultural minister of russia
and they'll be talking about the future
and we all hope that
they should be fruitful so there should
be
some sort of a ceasefire
at the end of the day lives matter now
to talk about that i have already
told you that we have with us on skype
mr harley islander from germany and dr
jamil khan the former ambassador uh from
karachi now a gentleman um since uh
earlier
we had with us the finance minister so
uh
we had to talk about uh the prime
minister's speech but coming
and talking about the ukrainian crisis
if i may put the first question to
ambassador jamil khansa
so
nuclear threat number one uh since uh
they have been activated uh
the defense minister of russia as well
as the chief of general staff of russia
they were told to remain alert now
coming that from mr potenza that means a
lot and now the europeans are not only
uh
giving the
technical weapons uh to the ukrainian
military and the public in general to
fight but they have also offered that
we'll be giving you most likely mig-29s
they are already in use with ukrainians
and other support worth around 450
million euros
so where is
europe heading because if this continues
this could lead to a mega disaster your
take drama first
no definitely all these all these
indicators which we are monitoring uh
that's not really very promising as
manufacturers really uh putting the
entire world in a lot of anxiety
basically and
if i may just share with you some of
those factual positions and the
statements of the two head of states
that is
mr putin and mr biden both so i'll come
on that but basically the nuclear
nuclear alert is the most alarming thing
which uh we are hearing now and it's for
the first time after cuba crisis exactly
after 19 stages come to this level their
start it has come to this level uh and
this is the
then the
u.s and its allies european countries
they are making its assessment but
during this assessment they are also
saying
that
there could be a miscalculation the way
things are really hitting up
and taking a new trajectory every day
the nato chief says that we have also
kept ready about 100 jets
and about 120 ships you know imagine
on alert and those ships are not only uh
used for the conventional purposes they
are used for the nuclear purposes also
then they say well they are they are all
response force that is ready uh you have
already mentioned in your intro about uh
the
kind of weapons which are pouring it
into uh ukraine and the street fights
the
dog fights has started in so many cities
um in ukraine so uh all these factors
attributing uh uh
towards a higher level of tension as a
matter of fact and
the world the world is now
so far there's hardly any effort today's
sanction which has been which has been
imposed um just a little while ago which
is a swift uh
system russia has been taken out
which is one of the one of one of the
toughest sanctions i to my best of
memory there's hardly any country except
iran and this is going to be
russia this time so
this swift system it is coming out
russia would have a real difficult time
and so is the case with all those
countries which are having
any kind of a trade and uh
business with the pressure what does it
imply and that's what our prime minister
was also mentioning the impact of such
crisis afghanistan he mentioned the
impact of afghan
issue on pakistan and now more
importantly on all the countries of the
world more importantly gender developing
countries
what is going to happen to them this
crisis and under these under this
backdrop
it was really mind-boggling that uh the
kind of uh reduction in fuel process
prices have been
announced today fuel prices and that
electricity prices um if mr three had
not said that how the how he is going to
really cut the corner and also how how
the money is being uh gathered for the
funds are being gathered for uh
offsetting this uh this is going to have
a direct impact on the poor people of
pakistan you know because fuel prices
means
direct and enhancement in the
in the taxes and the price it impacts
each sector of the country and
particularly the most uh
worstly hit
section of the society is the poorest
section of the society so that's one
good news and i really am quite quite
thrilled that this is this what has
happened and
he has already explained the finance
president explained so coming back on
u.s uh the
the ukraine and the um the u.s
the
the russia and the u.s standoff i would
say at this point trying so coming back
from that this is going to bring more
difficulties around the world so far as
economics concerned but this nuclear
part of it is
something which needs to be de-escalated
and so many countries now are
siding with the allies and so is the
case russia
it is expected it was expected in
security council meeting and now it's
expected in the general assembly meeting
the countries now have to come up show
their cards so that would have two
impacts number one that it would start
bringing countries into blocks uh which
we never wanted you know as a matter of
fact and also uh this is going to have a
direct um the realignment and the
geopolitical landscape it appears is
going to change very soon um i may also
draw your attention uh the
the
harmonization of so many thoughts
although
this statement of china is slightly
different but
in so many
um
china and russia they are working
together including space weaponization
and space capitalization their progress
so much both these countries
that it has almost come parallel to
the to us and its allies so all the
factors if we if
if we consider then in that case this
step seems to be quite difficult but a
bigger process which i'm hearing reports
of most of the channels and i'm being
asked is question two and that is a
nuclear flash point uh
at this stage with all these posturing
what is has happened uh it doesn't
appear that it will just trigger off the
third world war or something because in
all these countries they understand it
quite well
that uh third world war or a nuclear
from the
use of
nuclear weapon is a
mutual destruction of the entire world
so that appears right as you are saying
is is the accidental thing
war can start but it can it can go into
multi-faceted multi-faceted directions
and there shouldn't be an accident that
would be yeah and ambassador that that's
that's what we've been hearing also
because if you switch on the western
channels
european or american or canadian or any
other
obviously one concept is totally
anti-russia
earlier there was this press conference
between the german foreign
minister as well as the slovenian
foreign minister and they talked about
it we also got to know that the germans
they really want to now this question is
for you mr harley uh that
the germans really want that they should
also beef up the security they should
buy new weapons new technologies
all sorts of uh you know uh the the
material support the military assets so
that the the security of germany should
be taken care of two percent of the gdp
now that is something which we never
heard of but this could be and germany
could not be the only country so many
other countries as um the western media
says that the finland could be invaded
poland could be invaded uh perhaps
romania could be invaded now we have to
support them
said that support on one side the
commitment of the russians on the other
side the kind of forces they have
that is a recipe for a perfect huge
disaster
perfect disaster that can be avoided but
unfortunately
so far things are not that great
your take sir
well i have to say living in germany
when i heard about the reduction in
petroleum prices in pakistan and cutting
electricity rates
maybe you're going to see a lot of
german refugees coming into pakistan
because the electricity rates are going
up by 40 percent the last two months in
germany exactly before the cutting of
nordstrom 2.
and the gas prices are going up
so the question is
what's gotten into the german chancellor
and the german government in the last
couple of days
the the situation between russia and
ukraine was clear for a long time it was
not ukraine that was the issue it was
nato
and nato's unwillingness to give the
russian security guarantees that go back
for 20 years
they promised the russians no eastward
expansion they promised that they would
consider
a neutrality of ukraine and then after
the february 2014 coup
ukraine became a launching ground for
provocations against russia
and so what we're seeing
is a ganging up
by the united states and the british in
particular
to pressure the europeans
to go along with the idea that russia is
the bully the aggressor and russia has
to be stopped and what president putin
said is we have nowhere to go you're
moving weapons right up to our border
now the question that you asked i mean
this is a recipe for disaster
and i'm not sure the german people want
to spend an extra 100 billion dollars on
defense especially when the roads are
terrible here the trains are breaking
down bridges are collapsing uh education
system is in trouble why are we spending
another 100 billion dollars to confront
russia
i think this gets to the the bigger
question
the real issue
and i think in this pres prime minister
khan is right
blocks are not the solution
if you divide the world into blocks you
have a geopolitical recipe for disaster
instead we need and this is what the
schiller institute is calling for and
mrs helga zeppela rouge our chairman we
need a conference to draft a new
security architecture which protects the
security of all sovereign nations
and along with that the financial
security of all nations you mentioned
the international monetary fund we need
credit for development
not debt collectors
and this is the one you can get out of
this kind of crisis
so you're absolutely right and i agree
with the ambassador that it's heading
toward a catastrophe
but it's possible to step back from it
if you realize
that the policy of the west has been
provoking russia instead of provoking we
need more diplomacy that's how we got
out of the cuban missile crisis in 1962
real diplomacy and so far on the western
side we haven't seen that
now uh uh talking to you mr ambassador
a couple of important points like for
example turkey if you remember during
this uh issue regarding syria the
americans were there russians were there
turkey had shot down a jet of syria and
then later an f-16 of turkey shot down a
jet of russia
and interestingly the 10 billion dollars
worth of tourism coming in from russia
to turkey was stopped
remittances because a lot of people from
turkey work in russia stopped and a lot
of pressure was also developed
turkey is a member of nato but not a
member of european union and even at
that time i remember turkey was left all
alone americans did not support them up
till that level over here when you talk
about the ukrainian crisis in basab we
have learned that
ukraine is neither a member of nato nor
a member of the european union but
interestingly let's suppose if it
becomes a member a permanent member of
european union but not a nato member
will that sort out the issue or perhaps
it's kind of a mix and matcher because
if the europeans or the americans want
one country to be used in a certain way
they'll use it against their adversaries
like turkey same the case seems to be in
case of ukraine i mean it's it's a it's
a great country i would say but again uh
i i guess mr zielinski was expecting a
little too much from the western world
and a little has been given and that
also too late
that's very correct in fact
the examples which you have cited about
turkey and then you
came over to
ukraine if they become a member of the
european union and northern nato in fact
the entire efforts if we just try and
backtrack uh all these uh developments
which has been taken place taking place
after uh 2014
then we'll probably come to one
conclusion that every time there has
been an effort particularly after uh
lithuania lithuania
estonia and of the eastern
european countries once they were taken
into the lab of the nato portrait and
every time the russians have been making
their observation point that please
don't really
come close to our doorsteps and start
deploying the missiles and start
weaponizing this area
particularly under the backdrop of the
1991 perhaps the
the understanding that there won't be
expansion and it has been already
mentioned there won't be expansion of
nato to eastward
was very clear in fact
and from even international front
say law point of view yes there is a
violation if we see it from a one single
dimension that the violation of article
51 of the u.n charter that each
country's uh sovereignty and territorial
entry in integrity has to be respected
another country should really um by
force violate that so that's to that
extent yes but what is a backdrop of it
and if we go and stretch that then then
probably we can draw the strength
what russia did and
once there's a debate and general
champion probably will hear about the
general assembly resolution 2649 as well
once the people of ukraine started
asking for the russian help and support
and that's how the two territories of
ukraine were
declared independence and russia
immediately recognized and establishes
the magnetic effort bottom line is that
russians it was the question of their
life and death if the entire
nato had the excess on their doorsteps
to make all the deployments and russia
would keep quite there so that
government was writing on the wall that
they would they had drawn a deadline and
uh putin has been mentioning it time and
again time and again that look you know
just don't accept ukraine into don't
bring ukraine into your fold of nato and
if that happens then that would be a red
line
and it was as simple that's what is
going to happen if they want to
de-escalate because the situation has
reached to a level that russia is not
going to really
particularly the countries which i
mentioned to that extent perhaps but not
from the european it appears because
they understand about their national
security priority so from that well yes
and if if
the
ukraine only joins european union then
that that would be a different thing
that they would not be able to and
russia would have a full monitoring they
would not be able to deploy their
weapons on the doorstep although that
also creates some botheration but that
to my mind would not be in uh not not be
a violation of any international lord
that the particular state here at this
particular point there is yes one
violation and that is the understanding
and the accord which was uh
reached to a level of understanding in
1991 so from that angle yes but then all
these things what is going to happen to
a country and i don't know how pakistan
our minister finance and the prime
minister is going to manage that because
the procter and gamble it says that the
oil prices brent oil prices would go 150
if this is what they said
petroleum prices the fuel prices would
go high by about 30 40 percent so
if you remember if you remember
in 2078
before the recession
uh the oil prices did touch
147 a barrel
remember but dollar in pakistan at that
time was hovering around 60 61 and we
managed to
you know uh
control that but if this time it hits
this is going to be not only a problem
for for a country like pakistan which is
an oil importing country but for a lot
of other countries as well now coming to
you uh mr harley one important point
and that is about
the double standards of the west let me
be very straight here sir whenever
america wants to invade any country
rightfully or wrongfully
whether it's iraq or afghanistan or any
other muslim country sir they would come
test all their weapons there at the cost
of those countries
so called the allies like saudi arabia
or kuwait for that matter or uae
and then they would display their
weapons they would use them
and they would create a disaster
what they did in iraq i think one of the
best middle eastern countries
their infrastructure was ruined after
the bombing so the case was afghanistan
where so-called they believed that 2.2
trillion dollars was spent god knows
where they spend that kind of money but
my point is sir americans can against
all odds they'll say that wow you know
this is against
uh our national uh security or perhaps
there is a threat terminating from
afghanistan for god's sake what kind of
a threat would be emanating from those
caves
but sir when there is a real threat to a
country like russia
and the entire west is its adversary
unfortunately despite the fact that the
west depends on them as well especially
the european countries
that man says that you know you are
going to have your missiles right at my
doorstep in my porch this was the word
and you keep on pushing in and
eventually this is what he does
now sir america has not fought any work
on their own soil two attacks one was
pearl harbor and during the second world
war second was 9 11.
they don't care to be very honest sir
but don't you think this is going to be
a mega mega disaster
for the european union this is time that
keep the americans aside and let's talk
that is the way to move forward
otherwise whether it's russia or its
european union
they would be back in the
19th century sir
well my personal view is that this does
go back to 19th century geopolitics the
british view of the world you divide the
east and west you have no relationship
between eurasia and europe as long as
you keep them divided the british can
rule the world
and we've seen the results of that two
world wars in the last century
now your question about nato and the
west the hypocrisy is just unbelievable
what was done
in afghanistan and
this people are still suffering from it
when nato and the us went into iraq when
they went into libya when they went into
the balkans in 1999
you know they're talking about russia
going into ukraine as though this is
something that's never happened before
but the west has been doing it over and
over and over
so the the lack of recognition
of people like blinken and liz trust the
british foreign minister who's
out there with blood dripping from her
teeth as she talks about russia
as though she forgets what was done in
india by the british or what was done in
ireland by the british and so on
now the point is you can make the blame
all you want i think what president
putin said was reasonable
and legitimate that russia's security
depends on keeping ukraine neutral
not bringing nato in not bringing
weapons in and this is why we need to
have a conference that takes up this
question of a security architecture
no nation is safe unless all nations
security is
recognized
and you need an international conference
for that and that's what we're calling
for that's the we're circulating a
petition calling for prominent people to
come out and say that instead of trying
to
bankrupt russia
with the swift policy
that is what the main plan is to go
after them
and you know make sure that
as far as their economy is concerned
that should feel uh
the heat
last quick comment from you uh mr
harley mr vladimir zielinski says that
all the prisoners who have some sort of
a combat experience should come and join
us in the streets he himself along with
the other parliamentarians are wearing
the
jackets and carrying guns we do
understand sir a guerrilla warfare kind
of a situation has already developed
a lot of russian casualties have also
been reported because it's a different
ballgame and you're having those
anti-tank missiles and all
number point is up an afghanistan-like
situation could be in ukraine that could
be prolonged where exactly what happened
uh during the soviet invasion could
happen again here sir with a lot of
western support
could ukraine could be the new
afghanistan answer for russia
well i i think the problem is that when
president zielinski wanted to negotiate
he was told he couldn't by biden and by
others and then when they went to him
mccraw and schultz went to him after
talking to putin by that point biden
said no deal we're not going to make an
agreement with russia russia's security
guarantees are off the table
and so president putin reacted not only
to the refusal to discuss security
guarantees
but to the economic warfare that's been
launched in the last 48 hours which is
designed to [ __ ] russia and it was
even on january 25th the meeting at the
white house said we must destroy
russia's economy two senior
administration officials said that in a
press briefing
so
the russians were put against the wall
now
the hope there is that president putin
has made his concerns heard
that the ukrainians instead of sending
prisoners into the streets to die on
behalf of nato and western bankers which
is what's happening and ukraine has not
been served well by the post 2014
economic policy the international
monetary fund has made ukraine the
poorest country in europe correct so i
think it's i think it's crucial that we
have a conference that takes up security
guarantees a new security architecture
and an economic plan where countries
work together including with the belt
and road initiative of china and the
eurasian integration plans of which
pakistan is has a major role to play
absolutely as opposed to dividing into
blocks and fighting wars otherwise we
are doomed you know the afghan situation
would be
uh preferable to a nuclear war but no
one wants that war is horrible and it
has to stop
all right i would like to say thank you
very much gentlemen uh for your comments
and for your observation
and uh that's all we have for this uh
i'll see you tomorrow at 805 till then
you take good care of us
