Monitoring flour fortification to maximize health benefits : a manual for millers , regulators , and programme managers
13 September 2021 Departmental news Geneva Reading time : 1 min ( 352 words ) 
Flour fortification is the practice of deliberately increasing the content of one or more essential micronutrients in flour . Fortification of wheat and maize flours with vitamins and minerals is considered a cost–effective strategy to address micronutrient malnutrition and nutrition-associated health outcomes , such as anaemia or the prevention of neural tube defects

Fortification programmes must be monitored to confirm that they are working effectively , thereby ensuring the population is receiving a nutritious and safe fortified end-product . The development of fortification monitoring systems that can be properly implemented and maintained requires careful planning . 

The design and components of monitoring systems will vary according to the maturity of the programme and the resources available . This manual distinguishes two main categories of monitoring : regulatory monitoring and household or consumption monitoring . Regulatory monitoring includes four subtypes of monitoring : internal , external , import , and commercial , which collectively aim to provide consumers with fortified flour that is of high quality , safe , and adequately fortified . Consumption monitoring involves households and their members . 

This manual covers selected WHO / CDC indicators for monitoring fortification programmes . The use of these standardized monitoring indicators can facilitate comparison of results and sharing of knowledge across programmes worldwide . In brief , this manual aims to : 

• present a general monitoring framework to assist with the design and implementation of monitoring systems for flour fortification programmes ; 

• facilitate the use of standard WHO / CDC indicators ; 

• provide examples of practical tools which may be used for monitoring purposes ; 

• highlight relevant examples from existing fortification programmes ; 

• serve as a resource for training persons involved in the design , implementation , and management of flour fortification monitoring systems . 

This document is intended for stakeholders of the country ’ s fortification programme who have interest in and / or authority for setting up monitoring of the programme . Stakeholders may include government agencies that oversee fortification ; government agencies that monitor fortification , such as inspectors and staff of the food control authority ; industry partners that fortify or are part of the supply chain , such as millers , flour importers , and premix manufacturers ; research institutions ; consumer-protection groups ; fortification programme managers and international organizations that provide technical assistance to food and nutrition programmes .
