With growth in Europe and Central Asia having peaked at 2 . 7 percent in 2017 , policy makers face new challenges . How can they navigate the expected cyclical downturn ? How can 
they boost underlying potential growth that has slowed , especially since the global financial crisis ? How should they adjust regulations and reform policies to benefit from the digital revolution while mitigating the transition costs ? This report summarizes the economic 
outlook for the region and examines the adoption of new blockchain technologies . In doing 
so , it touches on all three challenges . 
The 2017 rates of growth of GDP ( 2 . 7 percent ) and private consumption ( 2 . 5 percent ) 
were faster than at any time since the global financial crisis of a decade ago . Growth was 
especially strong in Central Europe and in Turkey , but it was robust in other parts of the 
region as well . Unemployment rates are now close to their 2007 levels in most countries , 
and average inflation exceeds 2 percent , indicating that little spare capacity is left . 
Deceleration of growth is expected to be modest , but a sharper correction remains possible . Cyclical forces can easily reinforce one another , and additional shocks—rising protectionism , geopolitical tensions , larger than expected disruptions caused by Brexit—could 
materialize . There is little room for further monetary stimulus if the expected slowdown is 
sharper than expected . The region has rebuilt some fiscal buffers , however . The average 
fiscal deficit in 2017 is estimated at just above 1 percent of GDP , down from 6 percent during the 2009 crisis and close to levels at the end of the boom that preceded that crisis . Fiscal 
stimulus is thus an option in several countries in case of a sharper than expected slowdown . Under the baseline scenario of only a modest deceleration , however , a further 
buildup of fiscal buffers seems the best strategy . 
Many countries in the region have proven to be fertile ground for the development of 
cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies . The emergence of these technologies is part 
of a broader wave of technologies that facilitate peer-to-peer ( P2P ) commerce , the individualization of products , and the flexibilization of production methods . 
For a variety of reasons , these trends gained traction after the global financial crisis a 
decade ago . Blockchain technologies aim to organize P2P transactions and P2P information flows without intermediaries and central banks have opportunities to use blockchain 
technologies to improve their services . 
It is unclear how these technologies will develop in the long run ; their ultimate impact 
may be very different from the current applications . In response , policy makers should 
strike a balance between curbing the hype surrounding these new technologies and unleashing potentially transformational new opportunities . While encouraging and facilitating these innovations , they should prepare to craft new regulations to create a level playing 
field for new and old industries , by adjusting financial oversight , consumer protection , 
and tax administration . They should also address the massive volume of electricity used 
to mine cryptocurrencies . 
Executive Summary

Economic Outlook

Overview
Growth is strong in Europe and Central Asia ( ECA )  , stronger than at any time 
since the global financial crisis of a decade ago . GDP rose 2 . 7 percent , and annual 
private consumption rose 2 . 5 percent . Growth was especially strong in Central 
Europe and Turkey , but it was robust in other parts of the region as well . 
Growth has likely peaked , however . Increased capacity utilization , unemployment rates close to their 2007 levels , and average inflation now exceeding 2 percent are all signals that growth is likely to decelerate . 
The peaking of growth raises several questions
• How well is the region prepared for a sharper than expected cyclical downturn ? As fiscal deficits have fallen to an average 1 . 5 percent of GDP , fiscal 
policy could be used . But in most countries , monetary tightening would probably be more appropriate . 
• Why is the underlying structural growth so low ? Growth in 2017 was 0 . 4 percentage points below the average growth rate between 2000 and 2007 . The 
decelerating growth trend is associated with the shift toward services , the decline in capital deepening , and a slower pace of measured total factor productivity ( TFP )  . 
• Has the economic upswing been used to adjust to the new normal of digital 
technologies , more flexible employment contracts , and increased tradability 
of goods and services ? An unfinished agenda remains in terms of rethinking 
social protection and facilitating private sector development in new , internationally competitive sectors . It is important that adjustments toward this new 
reality continue , even if the expected slowdown materializes or deepens . 
Economic Developments 
and Prospects
4 ● World Bank ECA Economic Update May 2018
Growth is strong throughout the region 
GDP growth of 2 . 7 percent in 2017 translated into a robust 2 . 5 percent increase in 
per capita GDP , as the population is growing at a mere 0 . 2 percent a year . This 
rate of growth was the fastest since 2007 and 0 . 9 percentage points faster than in 
2016 ( table 1 . 1 )  . Growth exceeded 4 percent in 20 of the 47 countries in the region . 
Ireland and Malta enjoyed growth of more than 5 percent . Romania and Slovenia 
in Central Europe ; Armenia and Georgia in the South Caucasus ; and Turkey , Tajikistan , and Uzbekistan in Central Asia also reported strong growth . Azerbaijan , 
Belarus , and the Russian Federation emerged from recession ( although their 
growth was only moderate )  . Not a single country in the region experienced a 
contraction in 2017 . 
Private sector demand drove this vigorous performance . Government consumption increased by less than 1 percent on average in the region . Private investment rose by more than 4 percent , and growth in investment outpaced GDP 
growth for the fourth year in a row . The volume of exports and imports expanded 
by more than 5 percent in 2017 , roughly twice as fast as GDP growth . 1
The acceleration of growth has been a global phenomenon . Since the summer 
of 2016 , growth of global industrial production has more than doubled , approaching 5 percent in recent months , very close to the 4 . 8 percent global growth 
during the 2003–07 boom .

The ECA region closely followed that acceleration ( figure 1 . 1 )  . The region as a 
whole outperformed the United States in 2017 , and growth of industrial production in Central Europe and Turkey was on par with growth in China and India . 
This performance lies in sharp contrast to performance in the aftermath of the 
European banking and debt crisis , when the region ’ s performance significantly 
lagged that of the world as a whole . 
During this global acceleration , commodity prices rebounded . Copper prices , 
which are closely linked to the industrial cycle , increased 43 percent between 
October 2016 and March 2018 , more than any other commodity . Oil prices increased 30 percent over the same period ( figure 1 . 2 , panel a )  , providing some 
relief for energy exporters and recipients of remittances in the eastern part of the 
region . Consistent with their strong relationship with energy prices , grain prices 
increased 18 percent between October 2016 and March 2018 . Other agricultural 
prices declined , leaving the index of agricultural prices flat . 
The total nonoil commodity price index increased 10 percent over the last year 
and a half , largely reflecting the weakening of the U . S . dollar over that period , as 
all commodity prices are measured in dollars . The dollar depreciated 11 percent 
against the euro and 6 percent against the Chinese renminbi over this period . 
Average commodity prices expressed in these two currencies were thus relatively 
stable . The dollar also depreciated against other currencies in the region . Between 
October 2016 and March 2018 , it fell 16 percent against the Czech koruna , 14 
percent against the Albanian lek and the Polish zloty , 9 percent against the Russian ruble and the Hungarian forint , 7 percent against the Romanian leu , and 3 
percent against the Kazakh tenge . Only a few regional currencies depreciated 
during this period against the dollar . The Turkish lira depreciated 27 percent , and 
the Azeri manat depreciated 5 percent . Metal and oil prices increased in all currencies , and many other commodity prices declined in euros or other currencies 
in the region . 
Despite their cyclical upturn , oil prices are nowhere near their historical highs . 
Indeed , adjusted for inflation , global oil prices are 57 percent below their peak of

July 2008 and 43 percent below the average level between early 2011 and late 2014 
( figure 1 . 2 , panel b )  . 2 There are no signs that oil markets will return to those record prices . Consequently , adjustments in countries that directly or indirectly 
depend on oil exports should continue . 
Several of these countries have become more competitive in international 
markets and begun diversifying their economies , partly as a result of the depreciation of real exchange rates since the fall in oil prices late 2014 . Unexploited 
opportunities remain to shift farther away from nontradable production . Domestic reforms that correct price distortions , eliminate privileges for state-sponsored 
companies , and unleash more competition and innovation remain essential . The 
recent wave of reforms in Uzbekistan sets a good example . 3 They will likely lead 
to further diversification and may trigger reforms in surrounding countries .

Growth appears to have peaked
Signals are mounting that global growth has peaked . With less spare capacity , 
lower unemployment , rising inflation , and tightening monetary policy , the potential for continued rapid growth has diminished , especially in the ECA region . 
Unemployment is now close to where it was at the height of the boom a decade ago ( figure 1 . 3 , panel a )  . The labor market has become tight , especially in 
Northern Europe . The rapid decline in unemployment is remarkable , given the 
history of hysteresis in the region ’ s labor markets . After every major crisis , the 
typical pattern in Europe was for unemployment rates to settle at higher levels . 
It is especially encouraging that youth unemployment in the European Union 
has fallen sharply . It is now back to 2005 levels ( figure 1 . 3 , panel b )  , having fallen

from 24 . 0 in 2013 percent to 16 . 8 percent in 2017 ( the overall unemployment rate 
fell from 9 . 5 percent to 6 . 7 percent over this period )  . 4
Average inflation in the western part of the region has been almost 2 percent 
since early 2017 ( figure 1 . 4 )  . That is a critical change from the deflationary threats 
in the aftermath of the European banking crises . Between 2012 and 2016 , the 
consumer price index declined in at last one year in Armenia , Bosnia and Herzegovina , Bulgaria , Croatia , Cyprus , Estonia , Finland , Georgia , Greece , Ireland , Italy , Lithuania , Macedonia , Montenegro , Poland , Romania , the Slovak Republic , 
Spain , Sweden , and Switzerland . In several of these countries , the GDP deflator 
still rose , and the drop in consumer prices reflected terms-of-trade gains . Nevertheless , the deflationary threat was a serious concern and the manifestation of 
underutilized resources . 
None of these countries experienced deflation in 2017 . The average inflation 
rate of 2 percent is close to the target of monetary authorities . As a result , the European Central Bank will likely discontinue quantitative easing in 2018 ; central banks 
outside the euro area are also expected to tighten their policies . Tightening has 
already started in Turkey , where inflation has reached double-digit levels . 
Asset prices have risen even faster than consumer prices ( figure 1 . 5 )  . The increase in real estate prices is not nearly as extreme as it was during the boom a 
decade ago , but in Northern Europe double-digit annual increases were not uncommon in 2017 . This boom is an additional reason for monetary policy makers 
to raise interest rates . 
In the eastern part of the region , monetary policies are likely to tighten in coming years , even as inflation has recently fallen ( figure 1 . 4 )  . High inflation in 2015 
and 2016 was part of a one-time price adjustment after the fall in oil prices and 
the subsequent unavoidable depreciations of exchange rates . That adjustment

has been completed . Further inflation should now be controlled by central banks , 
which have to build their credibility with floating exchange rates . Now that oil 
prices are recovering , tighter monetary policies make sense , as they can allow 
higher prices to be absorbed by appreciating currencies . 
Tighter monetary policy and rising interest rates will restrain domestic growth 
and reduce capital flows to emerging economies . The capital flows that were 
searching for yields in emerging economies when interest rates in high-income 
countries were close to zero will likely decline , moderating growth in countries with 
large external funding needs . In such an environment , a cyclical downturn is more 
likely than further acceleration or even stabilization of growth at current levels . 
That slowdown may already be happening . The Purchasing Managers ’ Index , 
which combines various indicators in the manufacturing sector ( new orders , 
inventory levels , production , deliveries , employment )  , has fallen in the region since the beginning of 2018 ( figure 1 . 6 , panel a )  . The drop from the peak 
reached in the last six months was particularly large in France , Germany , Italy , 
Turkey , and the United Kingdom , even if the index was still above 50 , indicating growth ( figure 1 . 6 , panel b )  . 
The coming cyclical downturn is expected to be modest , mainly because , with 
few exceptions , there are no signs of overheating that require sharp corrections . 
Investment ratios are still at balanced levels , and no steep declines in those ratios 
are expected . Inflation is at normal levels , and monetary tightening can be very 
gradual . GDP growth for the region is expected to fall from 2 . 7 percent in 2017 to 
2 . 3 percent in 2018 and 2 . 1 percent in 2019 . 
The expected slowdown is very similar for the eastern and western parts of 
the region . However , there are marked differences between smaller subregions . 
In the eastern part of the region , almost all the slowdown in growth is forecast to 
come from Turkey , with a modest strengthening of growth in oil-exporting countries . In the western part of the region , the slowdown is expected to be rather 
evenly distributed among members of the European Union , and some acceleration of growth is expected in the Western Balkans .

Although there are good reasons to expect only a modest deceleration of 
growth , a sharper correction is possible . Cyclical forces can easily reinforce one 
another , and additional shocks—including rising protectionism , geopolitical tensions , and larger than expected disruptions from Brexit—could slow growth . 
Does the region have the capacity for countercyclical policies ? There is no 
room for further monetary stimulus ; at most , the expected monetary tightening 
could be delayed slightly . The region has rebuilt some fiscal buffers . The average 
fiscal deficit is estimated to have been just above 1 percent of GDP in 2017 , down 
from 6 percent of GDP during the 2009 crisis ; it is close to levels at the end of the 
boom that preceded that crisis ( figure 1 . 7 )  . Fiscal stimulus is thus an option in 
several countries in the event of a sharper than expected slowdown . Under the 
baseline scenario of only a modest deceleration , further buildup of fiscal buffers 
seems the best strategy .

Two additional questions are worth investigating . Did countries in the region 
use the recovery to adjust the structure of their economies , to better equip them 
for future challenges ? Why has potential growth been slower since the crisis than 
it was during the boom that preceded it ? The rest of this chapter addresses these 
questions . 
The region has shifted toward more exports .  .  . 
The biggest and most important adjustment during the recovery has been the 
shift of production capacity toward exports . Despite the slowdown in global 
trade , the share of exports in GDP is now 10 percentage points higher than it was 
during the 2000s ( figure 1 . 8 )  . This shift is important , because the economic structure during the 2003–07 boom , when growth in many countries in the region was 
driven largely by expansion of nontradable sectors , was no longer sustainable . 
During that boom , capital inflows , oil revenues , and inflows of remittances resulted in increased domestic spending and a related loss in international competitiveness . In the new normal after the crisis , all three forms of foreign inflows 
are more moderate . The change has created the opportunity to become more 
competitive in international markets while reducing investments in real estate 
and other nontradable sectors . 
Imports have also increased as a share of GDP , albeit by less than exports . The 
overall current account surplus of the region has thus increased , largely because 
the deficits that Central European countries financed with massive capital inflows during the boom have disappeared . These inflows came with a sharp decline in investment ratios in those countries . 
This adjustment is similar to the correction in East Asia after the 1998 financial 
crisis ( box 1 . 1 )  . During the 1990s , emerging East Asian economies received large 
capital inflows after they opened up to global markets , just as Central Europe did 
later , during the 2000s . The reversal of capital flows in 1998 had similar effects on 
East Asia as the 2008 crisis did on Central Europe .

.  .  . and adapted to technological change
Apart from this macroeconomic adjustment , countries are adapting to the rapid 
change in technologies caused by the digital revolution , which has far-reaching 
consequences for the way production , labor , and commerce are organized . The 
analysis of how countries are adapting is beyond the scope of this chapter . Chapter 2 examines ECA ’ s involvement in some of these new technologies . 
In both regions , large current account deficits during the boom were financed 
with capital inflows that were reversed during the crisis . Emerging economies in 
East Asia received large capital inflows during the 1990s , after they opened their 
economies to global markets . Central European economies received large flows 
of foreign direct investment and other capital before and during their accession 
to the European Union . Their aggregate current account deficit widened to more 
than 8 percent of GDP in 2007 . Heavy borrowing in foreign markets increased the 
vulnerability of both corporate and financial sectors to capital flow reversals 
( Truman 2013 )  . In both cases , the reversal of capital inflows led to a steep and 
immediate decline in investment rates . In East Asia the loss in income was larger , 
so the immediate fall in investment rates was greater . Investments rates bounced 
back subsequently , but they remained below the preceding boom levels . 
A combination of factors caused the decline in labor 
productivity after the crisis
Growth in ECA returned to precrisis levels in 2017 . It has not been strong enough 
to compensate for the production losses that have occurred since the crisis , however ( figure 1 . 9 )  . Moreover , as little spare capacity is left , it is unlikely that these 
losses can be recouped in the coming years . Thus not only actual growth but also 
potential growth has declined since the crisis .

Similarities between recoveries in Central Europe after 2009 
and East Asia in the late 1990s
The recovery of economies in Central Europe from 
the 2008–09 global financial crisis was comparable 
to the recovery of East Asia following the 1998 
financial crisis . Both recoveries took about eight 
years . In East Asia , however , the impact of the crisis 
was much greater . Five years after the crisis began , 
GDP in East Asia was 37 percent below its precrisis level . In Central Europe , the corresponding loss 
was 20 percent .

In the region ’ s middle-income countries , slower labor productivity growth 
caused most of the deceleration in potential growth ; only 0 . 35 percentage points 
of the slowdown in potential growth can be attributed to slowing labor supply 
growth ( World Bank 2018 )  . The changing pace of capital deepening cannot explain this slowdown in labor productivity , most of which is reflected in total factor 
productivity ( TFP )  , the unexplained factor in production functions ( figure 1 . 10 )  . 
Differences across countries were considerable , and many idiosyncratic events 
occurred . But after the crisis , every country in the region except Ireland experienced a decline in the contribution of TFP to labor productivity growth ( figure 
1 . 11 )  . In most countries , TFP actually fell .

16 ● World Bank ECA Economic Update May 2018
Labor productivity growth can be decomposed into three components : 
• changes in labor productivity within each economic sector ( the within-sector 
component ) 
• changes in labor productivity resulting from the reallocation of labor across 
sectors ( the shift component ) 
• a cross component that represents the interaction between the change in labor 
productivity within a given sector and the change in labor input share of that 
sector . 5
As the third component is numerically insignificant , analysis of labor productivity growth can be based on the within-sector and shift components . This decomposition reveals three important trends in the drivers of labor productivity in 
Germany and some countries in ECA ( figure 1 . 12 )  . 
• The deceleration in labor productivity growth in Germany started during the 
1980s and continued in subsequent decades . Most of it was caused by weaker 
productivity growth within sectors . This pattern is also evident in other major 
European countries . 
• The contribution of sectoral shifts to overall labor productivity growth in Germany changed markedly over time . Between the 1970s and the start of the 
2000s , the shift of employment toward more productive sectors increased labor productivity growth by about half a percentage point . The contribution of 
sectoral shifts to labor productivity growth fell to zero after 2000 and turned 
negative around the time of the 2008 global financial crisis . The long-term 
trend of labor shifting toward sectors with higher labor productivity , and 
likely higher capital intensity , came to an end when the digital economy started in earnest ( see below )  . The contribution to labor productivity growth of the 
shift of labor to more productive sectors was greater in Central European 
countries than in Germany before the crisis , but as in Germany , it diminished

after the crisis . This change is in line with the boom and bust in the growth in 
FDI flows to these countries ( EBRD 2015 ; World Bank 2018 )  . During the boom 
period , FDI inflows created high-productivity jobs . These flows plummeted 
after the crisis . The contribution of the sectoral shift to productivity declined 
also in Armenia after the crisis ( box 1 . 2 )  . 
• Major crises—the second oil crisis of the late 1970s and the global financial 
crisis—led to a permanent loss in productivity . Even where productivity 
growth returned to the original ( downward ) trend , the damage of the crisis 
was not recouped . Productivity remains below the levels that would have 
been achieved had the crisis not occurred . The lasting impact of deep crises on 
productivity growth may have been caused by the loss of capital and skills 
that become obsolete or by a loss in confidence by workers who suffered extended bouts of unemployment . 
The reasons for the long-term decline in within-sector labor productivity 
growth , in many ECA countries and globally , have been debated in the economic 
literature . The change in within-sector labor productivity can be decomposed 
into changes generated by capital deepening and changes that cannot be explained ( TFP )  . The contribution of capital deepening shrank significantly in several , but not all , countries during the years around the 2008 crisis . And almost all 
countries experienced a decline in within-sector TFP growth . 
The literature has suggested several possible causes for the slowdown in TFP . 
First , deep reforms led to a temporary rise in productivity growth in several ECA 
A new normal in Armenia
Armenia ’ s economy changed markedly following 
the global crisis . Per capita GDP growth fell from 
8 . 4 percent a year in 2003–09 to 3 . 2 percent a year 
in 2010–16 . Labor productivity growth was similar 
in the two periods ( 6 . 7 percent a year before the 
crisis and 6 . 2 percent after )  , but migration flows , 
employment levels , and the composition of labor 
productivity growth changed dramatically . 
During the boom , many people found jobs 
abroad , especially toward the end of the period , 
when oil revenues skyrocketed in Russia . As a 
result , Armenia ’ s population declined by almost 5 
percent between 2003 and 2009 . At the same time , 
many jobs were created in construction and other 
nontradable sectors , to satisfy domestic demand 
fueled by remittances . The combination of emigration and job creation boosted the share of the 
population that was employed from 36 percent in 
2003 to 40 percent in 2009 . During those six years , 
the shift toward capital-intensive construction 
led to an increase in labor productivity of 4 percentage points a year . Within-sector productivity 
growth contributed only 2 . 7 percentage points to 
overall labor productivity growth , perhaps because 
elevated domestic demand reduced competitive 
pressures on the supply side . 
These patterns reversed in the aftermath of the 
crisis . Emigration slowed , the population increased 
by 1 . 7 percent between 2010 and 2016 , and the 
construction sector and other nontradable sectors 
laid off workers . As a result , the share of the population that was employed fell to 34 percent . The 
impact of sectoral shifts on productivity growth 
turned negative , and the within-sector contribution to annual labor productivity growth increased 
to 7 . 4 percentage points . The increase may have 
reflected increased competition , as domestic 
demand declined and production shifted toward 
goods and services that are tradable in international markets .

countries . Productivity growth subsequently fell when major aspects of the reform agenda were completed . In Central Europe , reforms connected to EU accession initially boosted the growth of GDP and productivity . Reform momentum , 
and productivity growth , slowed after EU accession , in the mid-2000s ( World 
Bank 2018 )  . In Central Asia and the South Caucasus , TFP growth accelerated in 
the 1990s with institutional reforms in the early transition period . It plunged by 
the beginning of 2000s , perhaps because such benefits diminished as the room for 
further reforms narrowed . 
Second , across the world , technological changes in advanced and emerging 
economies affected the measurement and growth of productivity . The digital 
revolution that began in the 1990s led to a massive shift of resources to information and communications technology ( ICT ) industries . The output of these industries is notoriously difficult to measure ( for example , how does one value free 
Internet services financed by advertisements ?  )  . If the value of these new services 
is understated , then aggregate measurements of productivity may also be understated , particularly if growth slows in more traditional industries that are losing 
labor and capital to the ICT sector . Given the magnitude of the slowdown , however , not all of it can be attributed to measurement issues ( Syverson 2016 )  . 
The shift to ICT industries may also be connected to lower productivity . It is 
costly and time consuming to overcome the special difficulties involved in commercializing novel technologies ( David 1990 )  . Because it may take time to realize 
the return on the labor and capital moving to these new industries , shifts of labor 
and capital to ( initially ) low-return industries may depress aggregate productivity growth . In the United States , for example , the slowdown before the 2008 crisis 
occurred mainly in industries that produce information technology ( IT ) services 
or use such services intensively ( Fernald 2015 ; Gordon 2016 )  . 
Third , declining flexibility in some advanced countries may be reducing productivity growth . Business dynamism has declined in the United States , as reflected in the drop in reallocation rates for jobs ( after 1990 ) and workers ( after 
2000 )  ( Davis and Haltiwanger 2014 )  , and the pace of startup creation in the 
United States declined over the 2000s ( Haltiwanger 2011 )  . Across OECD countries , productivity growth in the most advanced firms remained robust over the 
2000s , but the difference in productivity levels between leading and lagging firms 
widened ( Andrews , Criscuolo , and Gal 2015 ; Haltiwanger 2011 )  . This phenomenon may have deepened the productivity slowdown if barriers to the reallocation 
of labor and capital intensified . 
Fourth , long-term trends in the global economy may be contributing to the 
slowdown in productivity growth . Aging and other demographic factors may 
account for part of the decline ( Maestas , Mullen , and Powell 2016 )  . The slowdown in global trade integration following the crisis may also be contributing to 
slower TFP growth ( Adler and others 2017 )  . 
No single factor is responsible for the observed deceleration of productivity 
growth : long-term trends , sectoral shifts , reform momentums , and global crises 
all play roles . No silver bullet can reignite productivity growth . Policy makers 
need a diverse set of instruments to encourage innovation , build up skills and 
infrastructure , and facilitate competition .

Notes
1 . That used to be the rule globally , but after the global financial crisis a decade ago , that 
ratio came down closer to one . As illustrated in earlier ECA Economic Updates , the global decline in the income elasticity of trade has not materialized in Europe and Central 
Asia . 
2 . Current real copper prices are also 57 percent below their historical peak , which was 
reached in April 1974 . 
3 . A key reform in Uzbekistan was the elimination of the dual exchange rate , which reduced domestic price distortions and opened up new export opportunities . The government also reduced import duties and is harmonizing the duty code with Eurasian Economic Union norms . 
4 . The much higher rate for youth unemployment is normal , for a variety of reasons . 
Search unemployment is much higher for people entering the labor market than for 
workers who already have jobs . Cyclical changes in unemployment also tend to be more 
pronounced for young people . During crisis periods , the lack of job vacancies disproportionately hurts people entering the labor market for the first time . During economic recoveries the opposite happens , as the opening up of new vacancies disproportionately 
benefits newcomers to the labor market . 
5 . This decomposition is based on sector-level data on real value added and the number of 
hours worked . We follow the methodology of Molnar and Chalaux ( 2015 )  .

Overview
• The emergence of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies is part of a 
broader wave of technologies that facilitate peer-to-peer ( P2P ) commerce , individualization of products , and flexibilization of production methods . For a 
variety of reasons , this wave gained traction after the global financial crisis a 
decade ago . Large digital platforms , such as Alibaba , Amazon , Uber , and 
Airbnb , are replacing many brick-and-mortar stores , service companies , and 
long-term employment relationships . 
• Blockchain technologies aim to go one step farther . They organize P2P transactions and P2P information flows without companies that operate digital 
platforms . Whether these technologies will completely eliminate middlemen 
or whether new forms of trusted intermediaries will emerge remains to be seen . 
• Cryptocurrencies are the first—and therefore most developed—application of 
blockchain technologies . They create money without central banks and facilitate payments without financial institutions . The success of several cryptocurrencies puts competitive pressure on transaction methods by existing financial institutions . However , serious limitations have become apparent . 
Decentralized organization of markets without trusted intermediaries can be 
very costly , and the volatility of the value of cryptocurrencies is a big obstacle 
to their becoming an alternative to legal tender . 
Cryptocurrencies and 
Blockchain : Hype or 
Transformational 
Technologies ?

• Other potential applications of blockchain technologies , from smart contracts 
to decentralized databases and open source social networks , could well become more transformational than cryptocurrencies . Current experiments are 
likely to result in lasting innovations , even if current applications do not stand 
the test of time . 
• The emergence of blockchain technologies has triggered a flurry of activities 
in Europe and Central Asia ( ECA )  , where people use cryptocurrencies for 
cross-border transactions and as speculative investments . Start-up companies 
are mining cryptocurrencies and providing blockchain services . Governments 
are experimenting with blockchain technologies to make their services more 
secure and more transparent . 
• Many factors provide a fertile ground for these activities in ECA . Several governments actively support innovation by start-ups . Governments are eager to 
digitize and streamline their services . Lack of trust in existing financial intermediation makes cryptocurrencies an interesting alternative in some countries . Cryptocurrencies are also used to sidestep oversight of cross-border 
transfers . Cheap electricity ( in Iceland and Georgia , for example ) entices the 
mining of cryptocurrencies . 
• Cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies pose a range of policy challenges . They include the need to ( a ) apply rules of financial oversight , consumer protection , and tax administration while at the same time encouraging 
and facilitating innovation ;  ( b ) deal with the massive volume of electricity 
used to mine cryptocurrencies ; and ( c ) determine whether governments and 
central banks can use blockchain technologies to improve their services . Policymakers should find a balance between curbing the hype and unleashing 
potentially transformational new opportunities . International coordination is 
needed to share best practices , avoid regulatory arbitrage , and explore how to 
regulate global decentralized networks . 
Introduction
Ten years after an ingenious experiment to create a cryptocurrency that allows 
secure and anonymous digital transactions to take place without the involvement of central banks or commercial banks , cryptocurrencies have become a 
multibillion-dollar industry . By December 2017 , the average price of one bitcoin 
( the first cryptocurrency ) had risen from just a few cents in 2009 to $15 , 000 , doubling its value in a single month . These gains attracted many investors across the 
world . On December 1 , 2017 , the U . S . Commodity Futures Trading Commission 
approved trading in bitcoin futures . Although the price of a bitcoin had declined 
to about $8 , 000 in April 2018 , the value of bitcoins in circulation was about $150 
billion as of April 10 , 2018 . 
Big companies , and individuals working together in large pools , are competing for the right to add new transactions to the existing chain of transactions . 
Their revenues , in the form of new bitcoins and transaction fees , are close to $20 
million a day . 
Chapter 2 : Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain : Hype or Transformational Technologies ? ● 23
In the wake of bitcoin ’ s success , hundreds of alternative cryptocurrencies 
have been created . Digital tokens have been issued as general currency ; for specific purposes ( for example , to rent computer capacity or cloud storage )  ; and as 
an alternative to traditional shares in companies . 
Cryptocurrencies have evoked strong reactions . Critics call these virtual currencies a bubble , a scam , and even evil ( Krugman 2013 ; Popper 2018 )  . Supporters 
predict that cryptocurrencies will ultimately replace money ( Rooney 2018 )  . 
There is less disagreement about the underlying blockchain technology , a protocol to achieve decentralized consensus about the validity of a common database , stored in multiple locations . Many recognize that the blockchain protocol 
can lead to tamper-proof , secure information systems without the need for a 
single administrator . But even here views differ markedly about how transformational this technology is . Believers foresee utopian societies of self-regulating individuals , without government or trusted intermediaries . Doubters argue that 
the number of useful applications has been exaggerated , that lack of regulation 
can have disastrous effects , and that in most cases trusted intermediaries will 
continue to provide useful services . 
It is unclear how these technologies will develop in the long run . Conceivably , 
they could be absorbed by existing institutions , with central banks issuing digital 
cash , governments using blockchain to maintain information systems , and commercial banks putting payment systems on the blockchain . 1 Many intermediaries 
might become obsolete , and many new financial instruments might be created by 
companies that do not yet exist . The main legacy of cryptocurrencies may not be 
the blockchain technology but standardized digital IDs using a combination of 
public and private keys on open-source software . 2 Such a development would 
allow individuals to own more of their data , instead of participating in proprietary information networks ( Johnson 2018 )  . 
Whatever the future brings , cryptocurrencies and blockchain protocols are 
part of a tidal wave of new technologies that is changing the way production and 
commerce are organized . Digital platforms , the sharing economy , apps , and 3D 
printers are fragmenting production and facilitating P2P transactions . 
Many of these new applications originated soon after the global financial crisis of 2008 , when the bankruptcies of established companies convinced many 
people that the economy would never be the same again . Investors were looking 
for new investment opportunities . Workers who had lost their jobs were willing 
to accept more flexible working relations . Consumers were persuaded to use 
some of their underutilized assets commercially . 
The fact that bitcoin was created in 2009 , soon after the crisis , was probably no 
coincidence . Trust in financial institutions had eroded , and the time was ripe to 
explore fundamentally different approaches . Whatever the future of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies may be , the trends toward decentralization 
and P2P transactions are unmistakable . 
Cryptocurrency and blockchain activities are widespread in Europe and Central Asia ( ECA )  . Massive mining of cryptocurrencies takes place in Iceland , Sweden , and Georgia . Many Russians own digital wallets , and experiments are ongoing in Serbia and Tajikistan to use blockchain technology to make the sending of 
24 ● World Bank ECA Economic Update May 2018
remittances more efficient ( UNDP 2018 )  . Estonia is using blockchain software in 
registries and plans to extend its use to medicine (  )  . Startups in many countries in ECA are contributing to these technologies , attracting 
finance for their activities via initial coin offerings ( ICOs )  . 3 Household investments in cryptocurrencies are not insignificant . Switzerland aims to become a 
cryptocurrency and blockchain hub and is leading in adjusting regulations to 
these new technologies . 
Comprehensive , global information on cryptocurrency and blockchain activities is not available . But anecdotal evidence suggests that ECA is more active than 
many other parts of the world , likely because of a combination of factors . Governments of many countries—from Estonia to Georgia and Slovenia—are experimenting with blockchain technologies . In many countries in the region , a supportive business climate encourages start-ups . And , especially in the eastern part 
of the region , the relatively new financial sector provides fertile ground for experiments . The lack of legacy technologies in the financial sector—and the lack of 
trusted intermediaries—makes exploring new financial instruments attractive . 
The rest of this chapter is organized as follows . Section 2 . 2 looks at the successes and drawbacks of cryptocurrencies , examining whether there is a future 
for money not issued by central banks . Section 2 . 3 looks at the possibility of smart 
contracts . It assesses whether markets can be organized without intermediaries 
and explores the possibility of secure decentralized databases . Section 2 . 4 summarizes some of the activities in ECA , with an emphasis on the experience in 
Georgia , which has been particularly active . Section 2 . 5 addresses the many policy challenges these new technologies have triggered . 
Creating digital money without central banks
Since the emergence of e-commerce , myriad attempts have been made to develop 
electronic payment systems . 4 Many successful and unsuccessful attempts were 
linked to credit card systems . 
Attempts to create digital cash are especially thought-provoking . Like coins 
and banknotes , digital cash should be anonymous and counterfeit-proof . People 
should be able to use it without the intermediation of banks , in the same way 
traditional cash is used outside the banking system . But unlike traditional cash , 
individuals , rather than a central bank , would create these digital coins . Private 
parties rather than the government would thus accrue the seigniorage . 
The white paper that started bitcoin in 2008 outlined a way to create and operate a decentralized electronic cash system ( Nakamoto 2008 )  . The payment system 
would not be under the control of a bank or a central authority . Rather , a large 
number of independent participants would operate it . The paper used existing 
cryptographic techniques of public and private keys to create anonymous and 
secure IDs . It used existing cryptographic time stamps , based on hash functions , 
to make past transactions irreversible . With those elements , electronic cash could 
become ( pseudo ) anonymous and counterfeit-proof . 5 But the main contribution 
of the white paper was the method it proposed to keep track of past transactions 
without a trusted intermediary . It would be done through an automatic process 
Chapter 2 : Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain : Hype or Transformational Technologies ? ● 25
that would achieve consensus among most participants about the cumulative 
history of transactions , even if a minority of participants sent erroneous messages 
to the network . 
The solution to this so-called distributed consensus problem was to let participants compete for permission to add a new batch of transactions to the decentralized database . Participants use their computer power to solve a difficult puzzle . 
The solution , which is considered proof of work , is impossible to find analytically ; it can be reached only through trial and error . The first person who solves 
the puzzle can add a block of new transactions to the chain of existing transactions—hence the term blockchain—and broadcast the new block to the network , 
so that all participants can update the blockchain in their own copy . 6
Although the puzzle is difficult to solve , its solution is easy to verify . Therefore , the nodes in the bitcoin network can easily determine if a proposed block is 
valid and should be added to the chain . Even if a node goes offline for a period 
of time , the network is not jeopardized . When the node goes back online , it accepts the longest valid chain as the correct one . If most of the computer power is 
owned by honest participants , the expectation is that they will create the longest 
chain , as the probability that they add new blocks is proportional to their computer power . As a result , the longest chain can be considered the consensus view . 
If a dishonest participant adds a block that is not accepted by others in the chain , 
that block will not become part of the longest chain , because the participant will 
not have enough computer power to add more blocks to the chain quickly 
enough . The difficulty of the puzzle is adjusted every two weeks , in order to create about one block per 10 minutes . Limiting the addition of a new block to the 
blockchain to one every 10 minutes ( on average ) prevents the network from being overwhelmed and keeps the size of the blockchain manageable . 
Competition for the right to add a block to the blockchain also solved the 
problem of the creation of new electronic coins . People who solve the puzzle receive a combination of newly minted coins and transaction fees . 7 With every 
block , new coins are created . Every four years the number of new coins per block 
is cut in half , until the maximum number of 21 million bitcoins is reached . Most 
of the remaining bitcoins will be added over the next 15 years . The creation of 
new digital coins is like unearthing gold , which is why the puzzle solvers are 
called miners in the world of cryptocurrencies . 
Ten years after the publication of the white paper , the concepts underlying 
bitcoin have proven successful . The blockchain technology is working and secure . Seventeen million bitcoins have been created , with an aggregate value of 
$137 billion in 2018 . Numerous alternative cryptocurrencies have emerged , and 
many companies and research groups are exploring additional blockchain applications . Cryptocurrencies have unleashed a wave of financial innovations , 
putting competitive pressure on the financial sector , especially its facilitation of 
cross-border transfers . 
Bitcoin ’ s biggest success has also become its most worrisome weakness . The 
proof-of-work concept that ensured achievement of a decentralized consensus 
has become excessively costly and wasteful . Attracted by the reward of newly 
minted digital coins , investors have created massive computer power with specialized chips to compete for permission to add a block to the blockchain . Over 
26 ● World Bank ECA Economic Update May 2018
the past few months , the reward for solving the puzzle ranged from $100 , 000 to 
$250 , 000 , depending on the price of bitcoin , the fees per transaction , and the 
number of transactions in a block . As more computer power was added to the 
network , the puzzle automatically became more difficult ( figure 2 . 1 )  . As a result , 
more and more electricity was needed to solve the puzzle . 
The system currently consumes an estimated 53 TWh of electricity a year—
almost as much as the entire country of Bangladesh consumes ( Digiconomist 
n . d .  )  . The cost of electricity used to process a single average transaction ( about 
$20 ) can power about five households in a high-income country for a day . 
These electricity costs are likely to rise . Because miners ’ profits of are still 
large , more computer power is being added to the network , increasing the difficulty of the puzzle . People who use the network to transfer bitcoins do not directly experience these costs , because miners are paid mainly through seigniorage rather than fees . But the costs in terms of electricity use , and the resulting 
burden on the environment , are real . 
A paradoxical side-effect of the rapid increase in computing power is that 
computer power has become more concentrated . A few companies have installed 
huge computer capacity in large dedicated factories , using specialized chips . 
Their exploitation of economies of scale leads to concentration of market power . 
Participants with less computer power started working together in pools ( figure 2 . 2 )  . With limited computing power , the probability of being the first to solve 
the puzzle is very small , and the income stream is irregular and thus unpredictable . 
By pooling forces , participants can generate a small but steady income stream . 
This concentration of computer power makes the network more vulnerable to 
malicious attacks . Even without attacks , if the market becomes an oligopoly , miners could manipulate transaction fees , refuse to process certain types of transactions , or deny service to users .

Note : The bitcoin difficulty index measures the difficulty of finding a new block on the blockchain . The greater the difficulty , the longer the time it 
takes on average for a miner to find a valid block . The difficulty in the first block of the bitcoin blockchain was 1 . The difficulty is adjusted up or 
down every 2 , 016 blocks . If the previous 2 , 016 blocks take less than two weeks to generate , the difficulty is increased ( and vice versa )  .

Note : Data are for March 2018 . 
The danger of market concentration is likely to increase . As the number of 
newly minted bitcoins declines , the income of miners will increasingly depend 
on fees . Lower profits will discourage new investors from entering the market , 
and smaller , inefficient miners are likely to exit . The sustainability of a completely 
decentralized payment system will be tested if miners must forgo the large profits coming from seigniorage . 
An advantage of declining profits because of disappearing seigniorage is that 
electricity use will no longer increase and might even decline . Box 2 . 1 models the 
long-term mechanisms determining the degree of difficulty of the puzzle , energy 
use , user fees , and even the price of bitcoins . The model is simplistic , particularly 
as it ignores adjustment lags and speculative bubbles , which likely play a significant role in reality . But it sheds light on balancing mechanisms in the cryptocurrency market and provides a framework for exploring the consequences of the 
disappearance of seigniorage . 
As of spring 2018 , the total reward a miner received per transaction was just 
below $100 ( figure 2 . 3 )  . Most of it comes through seignorage ( the bitcoin block 
reward ) rather than fees . The impact on the demand for bitcoin if this reward 
shifts away from seignorage toward fees may not be dramatic . Large international bank transfers can involve similar levels of fees ( through the SWIFT international payment system )  . 
28 ● World Bank ECA Economic Update May 2018
Equilibrium mechanisms in the bitcoin market 
Over time , as fewer and fewer bitcoins are created , 
the income of miners will shift from seigniorage 
toward fees . This box models the consequences of 
the shift for electricity use and other characteristics 
of the mining process . 
Assume that miners use the following production function to solve the puzzle that allows them 
to add transactions to the blockchain :  
( 2 . 1 . 1 ) 
where TS is the total number of transactions miners 
supply , A is the level of technology , K is the capital stock , E is the electricity consumption , and D
is the difficulty of the puzzle . There is substitution 
between capital and electricity : miners can install 
more advanced , more electricity-efficient equipment to achieve the same solution power with less 
electricity . 
Miners minimize costs under the restriction of 
the production function , where the cost per transaction is 
( 2 . 1 . 2 ) 
where c is the cost per transaction , r is the return to 
capital , δ is the depreciation rate of the equipment , 
Ph is the price of the capital goods , and Pe is the 
price of electricity . 
This optimization leads to the following cost per 
transaction c :  
( 2 . 1 . 3 ) 
If there are profits , new miners will keep entering the market , which will cause the difficulty of the 
puzzle to adjust so that in equilibrium profits equal 
zero :  
( 2 . 1 . 4 ) 
where n is the block reward in terms of the number 
of newly minted bitcoins , p is the price of bitcoin , 
and f are the fees . 
The market is not yet in equilibrium . Miners ’ 
profits are still large , as is the risk-adjusted return . 
As a result , still more investments in computing 
power should be expected , which will increase the 
difficulty of the puzzle . In equilibrium , the difficulty 
of the puzzle is given by 
( 2 . 1 . 5 ) 
Demand for transactions by consumers is downward sloping in the size of the transaction fees :  
( 2 . 1 . 6 ) 
where TD is the total desired number of transactions miners supply , and B is a scaling factor . The 
fees will be determined by the condition 
( 2 . 1 . 7 ) 
If consumers want more transactions than miners can facilitate , fees will go up and demand for 
transactions will adjust . Miners are constrained by 
the rule that only one block with not many more 
than 2 , 000 transactions can be added to the blockchain . This restriction is represented by T . Consequently , fees are determined by consumer preferences and the maximum number of transactions 
allowed in the system :  
( 2 . 1 . 8 ) 
The final price to endogenize is the price of a bitcoin . Currently , speculative behavior , which is very 
difficult to model , is likely to be one of the determinants of that price . A standard money demand 
function can describe the main determinants :  
( 2 . 1 . 9 ) 
where p is the price of bitcoin , a is the average size of transactions , and V is the velocity of 
money . If people want to keep bitcoins in their 
wallet because they expect the price to rise , then 
the velocity of circulation will fall and the current 
price will rise . If people want to transfer larger values with bitcoins , pushing up the average value of 
transactions , the price will also rise . These factors 
may have been the two main drivers behind the 
sharp increase in the bitcoin price in December 
BOX 2 . 1

( continued ) 
2017 . Market participants bought bitcoins to transfer large sums , and speculation pushed the price 
farther up . In equilibrium the bitcoin price would 
be given by 
( 2 . 1 . 10 ) 
where MS is the exogenously given number of bitcoins in circulation . Substituting this result in the 
difficulty expression yields 
( 2 . 1 . 11 ) 
The reduced-form equation for energy use per 
transaction is 
( 2 . 1 . 12 ) 
This model suggests that the system could 
achieve a long-term equilibrium in which electricity 
consumption is lower because fewer bitcoins are 
created . A decline in n reduces the energy use per 
transaction . Increasing the price of energy can also 
reduce energy use . Such a price increase would 
not increase the cost of transactions , it would 
merely reduce the difficulty of the puzzle , as some 
miners are pushed out of the market . Increasing 
the overall energy efficiency of mining ( increasing 
A in equation 2 . 1 . 1 ) does not reduce energy use . It 
merely makes the puzzle more difficult . 
The long-term equilibrium can be achieved at a 
lower electricity use , but this raises other concerns . 
It could lead to even more concentration of mining power , as in the process many miners would 
exit the market , making it easier for highly specialized mining facilities to capture larger shares of the 
computational power . The concentration of mining 
power could erode trust in the network and thus 
reduce incentives to hold bitcoins long , increasing 
the velocity of money , which would cause a drop 
in the price and further instability in the network .

The lack of scalability of the bitcoin payment system is another limitation . The 
proof-of-work concept prevents malicious participants from overwhelming the 
blockchain , ensuring its veracity . But it limits the addition of new blocks to one 
every 10 minutes and each block to a maximum size of 1 MB . The average number of transactions that can be included in a block of this size is 2 , 000 . In its current form , the bitcoin payment network can thus process only three transactions 
per second . By contrast , credit card companies process thousands of transactions 
per second . This constraint makes it impossible for bitcoin to substitute for largescale digital payment systems . 
Many attempts have been made , through new cryptocurrencies or additions 
to the bitcoin network , to avoid the electricity-consuming puzzle and to increase 
scalability . A leading concept is proof of stake , which could replace proof of 
work . 
8 In this concept , participants are elected to add a new block to the blockchain on the basis of the amount of own coins they want to attach to the contract . 
This proof-of-stake concept is like putting coins in escrow to earn permission to 
intermediate and charge transaction fees . Selection would still be probabilistic , 
but richer participants would have a higher probability of being selected . Ethereum , which runs a popular cryptocurrency , may adopt this approach . It represents a shift back in the direction of trusted intermediaries . The concept is not 
very different from existing financial institutions that are trusted because they 
have a stake in preserving their company . 
An even more radical departure from proof of work is to grant the authority 
to maintain the blockchain to a limited number of preselected , trusted participants . Ripple has taken this approach , working with commercial banks . It reinstates trusted intermediaries into the blockchain network . 
Another experiment to reduce electricity costs is to design a simple , albeit less 
secure , system for small transactions and to put only the balances of many small 
transactions on the blockchain . Lightning Network is taking this approach , as an 
addition to the bitcoin blockchain ( Poon and Dryja 2016 )  . 
Most of the discussions in the cryptocurrency community are about mechanisms to make trusted intermediaries superfluous . But another important question is how well cryptocurrencies perform the traditional functions of money . 
Money is useful because it can serve as medium of exchange , a unit of account , 
and a store of value . Like other forms of electronic money , cryptocurrencies have 
advantages over physical commodities like gold or banknotes . They are easier to 
store and easier to transfer over large distances . However , some inherent drawbacks of cryptocurrencies make them less optimal than legal tender in most 
countries . 
The most important drawback is the volatility of the purchasing power of 
cryptocurrencies , as illustrated by their exchange rate vis-à-vis legal tender ( figure 2 . 4 )  . That volatility in purchasing power makes them very risky to accept as 
a medium of exchange . It also makes them suboptimal as a store of value , as there 
is no guarantee that their value will not drop to zero . Advocates argue that cryptocurrencies cannot be inflationary , because their supply is fixed or at least limited . In fact , cryptocurrencies can be extremely inflationary if demand for them 
Chapter 2 : Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain : Hype or Transformational Technologies ? ● 31
drops ( because , for example , customers prefer alternative cryptocurrencies that 
are more user-friendly , are more scalable , or provide more privacy )  . The volatility 
of their purchasing power also reduces the value of cryptocurrencies as a unit of 
measurement . With large overall price swings , it becomes difficult to discern 
movements in relative prices . 9
In fact , there may be a natural limit to how stable the price of bitcoin can become . Unlike other commodity-type assets , bitcoin does not have a feedback loop 
from the supply side .

Sustained volatility can be very inefficient for a bitcoin-based economy . Extracting information about relative prices would be very costly . Entering into 
long-term contracts could become prohibitively expensive . 
The blockchain has proven to be very secure , but it is impossible to avoid security concerns altogether . Cryptocurrencies have been stolen by hacks into exchanges , where they are exchanged against legal tender or other cryptocurrencies , and hacks into mining pools . Users can protect stored cryptocurrencies by 
keeping their wallets offline . These offline wallets are called cold wallets ; wallets 
that are online are called hot wallets . Exchanges cannot be avoided ; they remain a 
weak link . The problem is especially severe because once stolen there is little recourse to recover the funds . 
Many of these problems are already being addressed . The security breaches of 
exchange sites forced many exchanges to use hot and cold wallets . This practice 
involves storing most deposits in an offline wallet , whose private keys are secure 
and are never stored on a network-connected device . A small portion of the deposits is transferred to the hot wallet , which is used for daily transactions and 
payments . If there is a security breach , potential losses are limited to the amount 
stored in the hot wallet ; at least in theory , most deposits should be protected . 
The attractiveness of cryptocurrencies will be tested once governments extend 
their financial oversight to cryptocurrencies in their efforts to fight money laundering , tax evasion , and illicit transactions . Doing so will challenge the ( pseudo ) 
anonymity of the cryptocurrencies . This oversight will be easier if the concentration of mining power continues to increase . To the extent that current use is motivated partly by the desire to avoid oversight , increased surveillance will reduce 
demand for cryptocurrencies . However , it is also possible that oversight may 
make the use of cryptocurrencies more attractive , as it becomes easier to incorporate them in the overall financial infrastructure . 
The innovative power of cryptocurrencies has been impressive . They have 
already put some competitive pressure on cross-border payment systems . The 
concept is promising , because it potentially improves financial access for people 
who live in remote areas that are not covered by financial institutions . 
It would be wrong to judge cryptocurrencies on the current state of affairs . As 
with many new technologies , childhood diseases will be outgrown . However , their 
real contribution may turn out to be very different from originally foreseen . 
The original designer of bitcoin and the blockchain technology wrote that “ the 
main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required ”  ( Nakamoto 2008 )  . 
In fact , the future benefits may appear precisely because the networks shift back 
to trusted intermediaries . It is even conceivable that the most successful cryptocurrencies will be linked to legal tender and issued by central banks . 
Creating digital markets without intermediaries
The ability to achieve distributed consensus , and to store immutable information 
in a decentralized database , makes a wide variety of P2P contracts possible without a centralized authority . Enthusiasm about other possibilities is enormous . As 
one observer put it ,  “ The paradox about bitcoin is that it may well turn out to be 
Chapter 2 : Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain : Hype or Transformational Technologies ? ● 33
a revolutionary breakthrough and at the same time a colossal failure as a currency ”  ( Johnson 2018 )  . 
Smart , or self-executing , contracts are examples of blockchain applications 
that go well beyond instantaneous transfers of funds with cryptocurrencies . Such 
contracts could be used on a blockchain platform to engage in commitments over 
time , without the help of middlemen . Ethereum , which has been operational 
since the summer of 2015 , enables the creation of P2P contracts that outline the 
conditions under which future payments occur . 
One example of such a smart contract is a parametric insurance contract , such 
as a contract that insures farmers against drought . The seller commits to pay a 
certain amount if rainfall remains below a certain threshold . The contract is preprogrammed to read the realized rainfall from a trusted weather data feed at a 
point in the future . The buyer purchases the contract with a one-time payment . 
The seller commits funds equal to the maximum payout in case of a drought . As 
the contract is fully collateralized , there is no counterparty risk . At the expiration 
date , either the buyer or the seller can execute the contract to check if the trigger 
condition has been met . The contract distributes the funds between the buyer and 
the seller and terminates itself . This type of contract could be handled without 
intermediation ( although insurance companies could also provide such contracts )  . Storing these contracts on the blockchain makes them immutable and 
guarantees their enforcement . 
Smart contracts could also be used for financial instruments other than insurance . Entrepreneurs already sell tokens to fund new companies through ICOs 
and promise future dividend payments in a smart contract on a blockchain . The 
tokens are similar to shares issued in an initial public offering ( IPO )  , but there are 
key differences . Shares are sold on stock markets and typically give the right via 
shareholder representation to participate in decision making . In contrast , tokens 
are traded on a P2P blockchain with no privileges outside what is written in the 
smart contract . Regulators across the world are working on directives that would 
extend oversight to ICOs . Doing so would increase the similarities between ICOs 
and IPOs , but the financial smart contract would provide a new , innovative , instrument to fund start-ups . It creates relatively liquid new financial instruments 
that can be used to finance small-scale risky ventures . 
The potential advantages of such P2P contracts are obvious . They could be 
available to people who have no access to financial instruments ( box 2 . 2 )  . They 
could also increase access to financial services that is now limited because of 
distrust in financial institutions . Currently , enforcement of contracts is not 
straightforward in parts of ECA . Smart contracts are secure , even if the counterparties do not know each other . Blockchain platforms could make these financial 
products more liquid if the new products could be traded outside specialized 
markets . 
There are potential disadvantages of smart contracts . Adjustments to the current blockchain platforms are likely required for them to work in a user-friendly , 
efficient , and scalable way . These drawbacks may be the reason why , outside 
ICOs , there have not yet been large-scale applications of smart contracts . 
The first disadvantage of existing platforms is the volatility of the value of 
cryptocurrencies , which is especially inconvenient with contracts that span many

Providing access to secure insurance
In many countries , individuals , farmers , and 
small- to medium-size businesses have limited or 
no access to insurance or hedging instruments 
for commodity price risks , floods , hurricanes , 
exchange rate volatility , and the like . Markets are 
incomplete or not available . When they are available , contracts are often not trusted to be enforced 
or are very costly , particularly for small transactions . Lack of this key financial service is associated 
with a high risk of falling into poverty , business failure , and the absence of entrepreneurship . 
Suppose that a small wheat farmer in a developing country is 30 days away from harvest . Although 
she may be happy with the current wheat price , she 
knows that she can sustain at most a 20 percent 
drop between now and the time she sells her harvest . In order to hedge against a larger decline , the 
farmer can purchase a put option with a duration 
of one month and a strike that is 20 percent lower 
than the current market price . Entering in such a 
contract will ensure that if the price falls below the 
strike price , the contract will pay the difference . 
The contract mitigates the risk by creating a price 
floor . 
Despite the relative simplicity of these contracts , many frictions may prevent small farmers 
from entering into such agreements . Although 
bilateral over-the-counter agreements are possible , the legal framework may not be well adapted 
to accommodate them , and enforcement can be 
difficult and costly . Small- and medium-size farmEspecially in the transition economies of ECA , 
financial markets are incomplete . Market-based 
financial institutions were established only in the 
early 1990s in these economies , and they are still 
only partially developed . Insurance products are 
particularly underdeveloped . The insurance rate 
of farmers in ECA is well below the global average ( box figure 2 . 2 . 1 )  . A recent report finds that 
these incomplete financial sectors are associated 
with lower growth of the bottom 40 percent of the 
income distribution ( Gould and Melecky 2017 )  . 
ers are not likely to have access to international 
financial markets in which these contracts are well 
established and markets are deep , and the need 
for intermediaries can make the process prohibitively expensive . 
Government interventions to support such contracts have often been ineffective . Such policies 
are either too costly from the government fiscal 
standpoint or create moral hazard if noninsured 
risks are covered by government payouts in the 
event of widespread loss . 
Blockchain technology and smart contracts 
raise the potential for insurance / minimum price 
contracts that are flexible , low-cost , secure , and 
highly customizable to a multitude of risks and 
payouts ( large and small )  , with only marginal transactions costs . This approach would provide easy 
access to foreign insurers , and enforcement costs 
would be low if the payout were collateralized in 
the blockchain .

years . Parties to the contract likely want security in terms of the purchasing 
power of payments . That goal could possibly be met by linking the contracts to 
futures markets , but it seems more promising to use tokens that are linked to legal tender . Doing so would be a major step away from the original concept of 
cryptocurrencies , as it requires a trusted party that can guarantee the value of the 
token . Still , it could be a natural development of the smart contracts . 
Fizzy is a parametric insurance application by the insurance company AXA 
(  )  , in which passengers purchase insurance by sending funds 
to the smart contract along with their flight information . If their flight is delayed 
for more than two hours according to a publicly accessible database , the smart 
contracts pays out compensation in euros . Fizzy could be developed into an 
Ethereum-based smart contract , but the volatility of the Ether token is likely to 
prove too much of a drawback for a large-scale application . 
If contracts shift to tokens that are linked to legal tender , the market can no 
longer operate without a trusted intermediary . Such an intermediary must sell 
additional tokens in exchange for legal tender if demand for tokens increases . 
The intermediary must hold part of the legal tender in reserve , so that tokens can 
be repurchased if demand declines . Such reserves are similar to the reserves financial institutions must hold when they create electronic accounts or mobile 
payment systems . In the case of tokens linked to legal tender , participants who 
maintain the blockchain would no longer be rewarded with the seigniorage of 
new coins ; the reward would consist only of fees paid by the parties in the contract . These fees might not be enough to attract enough participants who want to 
compete with one another . It is plausible that such a system would naturally 
converge to a permissioned blockchain , in which several preselected servers update the blockchain , eliminating the need for costly competition among servers 
and making the maintenance of the platform more efficient . 
A second disadvantage of smart contracts is that they are collateralized by 
freezing potential payouts on the blockchain . The blockchain provides security , 
but it is also inefficient ( like putting money in escrow , where it cannot be used 
productively )  . Insurance companies can pool risks and invest the cash flow . As a 
result , they should be able to provide cheaper services than offered in P2P contracts , in which investing the cash flow is not possible . Cutting out insurance 
companies could thus increase costs . 
There may be a trade-off between efficiency and independence from intermediaries . Higher costs may be worth paying where the public does not trust that 
normal contracts will be enforced . Where trust exists , the public might prefer to 
deal with insurance companies rather than anonymous peers . If blockchain contracts are used , trusted intermediaries will likely offer contracts without freezing 
the assets in the contract , reintroducing trust into these transactions . 
A similar argument holds for standard financial intermediation by banks . Because P2P contracts likely have a broader reach and can create innovative instruments , they could provide competitive additions to existing banking products . 
However , commercial banks have a big advantage in financial intermediation . By 
pooling risk , they can turn short-term liabilities into long-term assets . Because 
intermediation between savings and investments is much more difficult in independent P2P contracts without risk pooling , smart contracts are likely to be com-
36 ● World Bank ECA Economic Update May 2018
bined with , or even integrated into , existing financial institutions , rather than 
replacing them . Risk pooling could also be explicitly programmed in smart contracts , implying that these contracts will not be completely risk free . 
A third potential disadvantage of following the original blockchain design for 
smart contracts is the public nature of the blockchain . Transparency is attractive 
because it makes it easy to audit the validity of contracts by virtually anyone with 
an Internet connection . But participants in transactions may want more privacy . 
Therefore , it is plausible that smart contract applications will develop in the direction of more encryption , more restricted-read access , or both . 10
Many governments are experimenting with blockchain to digitize their services . Experiments with land and real estate registries are popular . One objective 
is to avoid the vulnerabilities of a centralized server . Decentralized storage of 
data means that several servers are always online , making it more difficult to 
alter data . 
Another objective is to prepare for a link with smart contracts , so that real estate could be sold online without the help of notaries , as ownership could be verified on the blockchain . Governments would still take responsibility for the information , including information about zoning and restrictions on sales . The goal is 
thus not to purge governments from transactions but rather to make government 
services more efficient and more trustworthy . 
In these applications , the registry can be updated by a limited , selected number of servers ( a permissioned approach )  . There is no need to let an undetermined number of miners compete for the updates . There is , however , a need for 
full transparency . Not everyone should be able to write on the system , but everyone should be able to read the registry . The reading provides the actual service 
and is also a mechanism for double-checking the veracity of the information . 
Another government application could be public procurement . The central 
government could issue a token backed by the national currency . Each ministry 
or municipality could be issued an address and allocated tokens as part of the 
budget process . They would use the tokens to pay contractors for public purchases ; contractors would redeem their tokens with the central government . This 
mechanism would make all purchases not only fully transparent but also instantly auditable by anyone , reducing graft . Social protection transfers could 
benefit from a similar set-up , although privacy concerns would have to be 
addressed . 
Large companies are also exploring blockchain applications . Companies need 
to be online all the time , for internal communications and communications with 
clients . One central server is not reliable in this respect ; a system that provides a 
common view of information through communication between independent 
servers is superior to a central server . Decentralized information is also more difficult to alter through hacks , because hackers would have to break into more than 
one server . 
Companies are experimenting with different versions of the blockchain protocol to transition toward a more decentralized information strategy . Experiments 
are moving toward permissioned systems , with a preselected number of servers 
maintaining the decentralized database . Decentralizing reduces the probability 
that participating servers become malicious , makes it easier to secure them , and 
Chapter 2 : Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain : Hype or Transformational Technologies ? ● 37
prevents the costly competition that is needed in a permission-less system . The 
decentralized consensus problem is easier to solve than in the original bitcoin 
application . However , with a small number of servers , data systems other than 
blockchain could be used . The advantages of a permissioned system may be the 
reason why there are no large-scale blockchain applications yet in these companies , despite the many experiments . 
Blockchain technology could also be used to manage vast and diverse data 
systems , such as health records , that are too complicated for a central server . They 
could benefit from decentralized servers that communicate with one another and 
always reflect the latest update of treatments and test results . The existence of 
secure , decentralized digital health records could significantly increase the efficiency of the health care industry . 
The main challenge for these kinds of data systems is privacy . Both reading 
and writing of health records should be limited . This requires adjustments to the 
original blockchain design , which is public , in the sense that everyone can read 
it . A health record application would be private , with secure encryption to protect 
confidentiality of medical information . 
These examples show the broad range of potential applications of blockchain . 
They also suggest that many of them could be very different from the original 
blockchain design . Instead of a public database , with an unlimited number of 
participants that maintain the blockchain and an independent cryptocurrency to 
be used in transactions , the most successful future applications could work with 
private information , a limited number of permissioned servers , and a token 
linked to legal tender for transactions . 
The most important components of those future applications could become 
the cryptography behind personal IDs , the time stamps that make data irreversible , and the open source character of the platform . These applications would not 
eliminate trusted intermediaries , they would make more competition between 
intermediaries possible . Digital platforms like Facebook , Uber , Airbnb , and Amazon use proprietary software and organize their own user IDs ; the veracity of 
their data is not protected through decentralized storage . All these platforms can 
gain natural monopoly power because of network effects , because the platforms 
become more useful and more powerful if more people participate . A standardize 
system of digital IDs and open-source networks could break that monopoly and 
increase entry opportunities . Experiments with P2P digital interactions are very 
important for this reason . Even if current applications do not stand the test of 
time , the ultimate result could well be transformational . 
Blockchain applications in Europe and Central Asia 
Many countries in ECA have provided fertile ground for cryptocurrencies and 
blockchain technologies , especially since late 2016 . When cryptocurrencies 
emerged , almost 10 years ago , activities were small-scale . As everywhere else in 
the world , early transactions were used largely for gambling or for the purchase 
illegal products on the dark web ( figure 2 . 5 )  . 11
38 ● World Bank ECA Economic Update May 2018
The use of cryptocurrencies intensified at the end of 2016 , especially for large 
cross-border transfers . When the prices of cryptocurrencies skyrocketed in 2017 , 
investments in mining capacity increased sharply and people began investing in 
cryptocurrencies in the hope of benefitting from further price rises . 
Investments in blockchain technologies surged . Governments in many ECA 
countries began experimenting with blockchain to improve their services . Some 
central banks are studying the issuance of legal tender in the form of digital currency , and financial institutions are piloting blockchain applications to incorporate them in the existing financial architecture . 
ECA has become an important center for ICOs . In terms of the number of 
projects , the Russian Federation ranks third globally ( with 8 . 8 percent of all projects )  , Switzerland fifth ( 6 . 9 percent )  , Estonia seventh ( 3 . 0 percent )  , and Lithuania 
eighth ( 2 . 8 percent )  ( figure 2 . 5 )  . This section examines the reasons for the strong 
interest in blockchain technologies in ECA , based on anecdotal evidence . 
Blockchain technologies , which place a heavy emphasis on making financial 
intermediaries redundant , are particularly attractive in countries where trust in

financial institutions is lacking , people want to avoid oversight , and / or financial 
sectors are underdeveloped ( Aris 2017 )  . Countries where corruption and political 
instability are higher , confidence in the rule of law is lower , and regulatory quality is lower tend to adopt bitcoin more rapidly ( all four correlations shown in 
figure 2 . 6 are statistically significant )  . 
A prime example is Republica Bolivariana de Venezuela , where people seek 
alternatives for the bolivar , the value of which been eroded by hyperinflation . 
Such extreme examples of hyperinflation no longer exist in ECA . Nevertheless , 
some anecdotal evidence suggests that weak institutions or vulnerable banks are 
one reason behind the interest in cryptocurrencies . 12 Financial dollarization 
remains substantial in the eastern part of the region , reflecting lack of trust in

existing legal tender . It has resulted in much lower savings at banks than in other 
parts of the world ( Gould and Melecky 2017 )  . Households are looking for alternative saving options . 
Another reason for the use of blockchain technologies in ECA is the desire to 
develop alternative means of transferring large funds . Russia is the largest issuer 
( more than $956 million ) —followed by the United States ( $811 million ) and Switzerland ( $514 million ) —because of the $850 million raised for the TON blockchain . 13 One of the goals of that ambitious project is to provide an alternative to 
the SWIFT international interbank payment system ( Aris 2017 )  . Russia also has 
the largest number of users of the digital wallet on blockchain . com ( UNDP 2018 )  . 
Despite these examples , it is doubtful that ICOs will have a broader application 
as venture capital if security is not built in for investors . 
Established financial centers are striving to adjust to meet the competition 
from a disruptive technology like blockchain . Switzerland is leading in adjusting 
financial regulations to cover ICOs , ensuring that they are incorporated into the 
existing financial architecture rather than developed as an outside alternative 
( see Atkins 2018a , 2018b ; Financial Times 2018 )  . Its aims to become a cryptocurrency and blockchain hub is reflected in its vibrant ICO activities . For example , 
Sirin Labs raised $157 million for the development of a blockchain-based smartphone . In line with these developments , a Swiss foundation , advised by Jacob 
Frenkel , chairman of JPMorgan Chase International , and Nobel laureate Myron 
Scholes , raised $50 million to develop a cryptocurrency backed by Special Drawing Rights ( SDRs )  . Saga would have a stable value and be integrated into the 
existing financial sector , including anti-money-laundering checks , with deposits 
in the International Monetary Fund ’ s SDR holdings . France is also planning a 
regulatory framework for ICOs ( Aris 2017 )  . 
Governments in ECA are accumulating in-house experience with blockchain 
pilots to improve government services . Estonia , Georgia , and Ukraine have experimented with blockchain to set up land and real estate registries . They are still 
searching for more specialized and more efficient designs , but the experiments 
have given a boost to efforts to digitize government services . 
Some government banks in ECA are seeking to improve their services through 
the use of blockchain technologies . The Russian state-owned VEB bank is piloting a new blockchain-based payment system with the regional government of 
Kaliningrad ( Milano 2018 )  . Another state-owned bank , Sberbank , is partnering 
with Russia ’ s federal anti-monopoly service to use blockchain technologies to 
store and transfer documents . 
Official bodies in ECA are investing in blockchain research to improve services . The European Commission has funded a blockchain observatory to encourage blockchain technologies and help formulate policy recommendations , 
especially for smart contracts and the improvement of government services 
( Young 2017 ; Nicholson 2018 )  . Lithuania has opened a blockchain center to incubate start-ups , partnering with similar centers in Melbourne and Shanghai ( MediTelegraph 2017 )  . Separately , the central bank of Lithuania offers a one-year sandbox environment for start-ups that develop new digital financial technologies . 
Estonia is exploring opportunities to use blockchain technologies in medicine 
Chapter 2 : Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain : Hype or Transformational Technologies ? ● 41 
(  )  . Georgia is investigating the possibility of supporting 
smart contracts . Serbia and Tajikistan are experimenting with remittances on 
blockchain , in cooperation with the United Nations Development Programme 
( UNDP 2018 )  . Azerbaijan is experimenting with digital IDs for banking using 
blockchain ( SputnikInternational 2018 )  . The Swedish central bank is considering 
launching its own digital currency ( Aris 2017 )  . 
Small ECA countries with a supportive business climate and the absence of 
legacy financial instruments are well placed to introduce new financial instruments based on blockchain technologies . Tokenization and ICOs enable small 
start-ups , which lack easy access to finance , to raise funds in global markets . 
Dynamic start-ups in the Baltic countries and several other small countries , including Georgia , have issued ICOs ( figure 2 . 7 )  . These examples are instructive for 
other economies in the region that have long been dominated by state-owned 
enterprises and have grown primarily through the nontradable sectors . For many 
of those economies , the challenge is to unleash new growth potential in

internationally competitive sectors . The new P2P technologies provide a gateway 
to these markets . More specifically , activities on and contributions to blockchain 
networks are automatically exposed to international competition . 
Seemingly more than in other parts of the world , governments in ECA are 
restraining natural monopolies of tech giants . People in the region show strong 
privacy concerns when data become proprietary and are captured by tech companies . The open character of the blockchain architecture could break the monopoly on data . Several governments and the European Commission are looking 
at the possibility of using the new technologies to reduce the power of large digital network companies . 
The anecdotal evidence presented here suggests that there may be multiple 
explanations for the blockchain activities in Europe and Central Asia : 
• In the eastern part of the region , market-based financial sectors are relatively 
new and have not fully matured . Insurance and capital markets are underdeveloped . Land registration and cadasters of real estate can still be improved . 
Blockchain technologies could help fill these gaps . 
• Vulnerabilities in the banking sectors after the transition in 1991 , the global 
financial crisis in 2008 , and the plunge in oil prices in 2014 have eroded trust 
in financial institutions . In the eastern part of the region , bank deposits are 
exceptionally low , and consumers are looking for alternative ways to invest 
their savings ( Gould and Melecky 2017 ) 
• Throughout the region , banks dominate financial sectors . Venture capital that 
does not require collateral is scarce . New forms of fund raising could help tech 
start-ups that have a potential to grow quickly in competitive global markets . 
• Demand for new ways of making cross-border transfers is strong . Remittances are large in the region ; the high transactions costs associated with them is 
onerous . The region also has a large share of illicit financial flows , linked to 
money laundering , tax evasion , and the circumventing of capital controls or 
sanctions . 
• Governments in the region provide a broad range of services . They oversee 
elaborate social security systems , and most of them play an integrating role in 
health care , pensions , and education . There is continuous demand to make 
these services more efficient and more transparent . Many governments are 
experimenting with blockchain technologies to achieve those goals . 
• Governments in the region are looking for ways to break the power of large 
tech companies and increase privacy . 
It is unclear which experiments will have a lasting impact . The transformational impact may come from applications that are very different from the original blockchain design . The blockchain experiment has already boosted innovation and competition , in both the private sector and government . For that reason 
alone , blockchain experiments deserve support . 
ECA is active in the mining of cryptocurrencies . Georgia is home to one of the 
largest mining companies of the world ( Bitfury ) as well as many smaller miners 
( box 2 . 3 )  . Bitfury , which is building additional facilities in Canada , Iceland , and 
Norway , controls about 10–15 percent of global mining . 
Chapter 2 : Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain : Hype or Transformational Technologies ? ● 43
Cryptocurrency mining and the demand for electricity in Georgia
Mining of cryptocurrencies is surprisingly widespread in Georgia , thanks to tax exemptions and 
low electricity prices . Indeed , Georgia has had the 
fastest-growing electricity consumption per capita 
in all of ECA since 2009 ( box figure 2 . 3 . 1 )  . 
This process was jumpstarted when Bitfury , one 
of the world ’ s largest bitcoin miners , built a 20MW 
data center in Gori and a 40MW mining facility in 
Tbilisi , with funding from the Georgian Co-Investment Fund . The Tbilisi facility , located in a free 
industrial zone , has daily revenue of $250 , 000–
$400 , 000 . Bitfury recently sold this facility to its 
Chinese partner , Asian Chong Sing Holdings . It 
is now building mobile data centers to be sold to 
other investors . Other companies have built mining 
facilities in free industrial zones in Kutaisi . 
Many households have joined mining pools . 
Surveys indicate that up to 5 percent of households in Georgia are engaged in cryptocurrency 
mining or investments . 
These mining activities have had a striking 
impact on electricity consumption , turning Georgia from a net exporter to a net importer of electricity . Estimates of the share of Georgia ’ s electricity demand devoted to cryptocurrency mining 
range from 10 to 15 percent—and the figure could 
be even higher , because it is difficult to observe 
small-scale mining activities . Per capita electricity 
consumption in Georgia was 3 , 343 KWh in 2016 , 
almost three times higher than in countries with 
similar levels of per capita income . Even after correcting for historically high electricity consumption in Georgia ( likely because of the availability 
of inexpensive hydropower )  , energy use in recent 
years is remarkable . Between 2014 and 2016 , per 
capita energy consumption increased by 655 
KWh , of which only 65 KWh can be explained by 
rises in income . Some 590 KWh , or 18 percent of 
total demand , remains unexplained . Even before 
2015—actually , since the start of bitcoin , in 2009—
the unexplained part of electricity demand was rising ( box figure 2 . 3 . 2 )  .

Cryptocurrency mining is also booming in Iceland ( Perper 2018 )  , which is on 
track to use more electricity for mining than it uses to power all of its residences . 
Armenia is set to be home to a 50MW mining farm ( Murphy and Stafford 2018 )  . 
Slush Pool , a bitcoin mining pool with a market share of about 7 percent and 
many participants from all over the world , is run by Satoshi Labs , a mining company based in the Czech Republic . KnCMiner is a mining pool in Sweden . Another mining pool is in Russia . 
Cryptocurrency mining thrives in a cold climate ( avoiding the need for cooling ) and in areas where electricity costs are low . En + Group , a Russian energy 
company , is preparing to offer electricity to cryptocurrency miners at five plants 
in Siberia ( Marson 2017 ; Helms 2018 )  . The electricity capacity available for miners could well dwarf the capacity of existing mining facilities in ECA . EN + could 
attract Chinese miners , who are currently dominant players in the global market 
but find a less and less hospitable environment in China . 
BOX 2 . 3 ( continued ) 
Of course , the mining of cryptocurrencies also 
raises incomes . Mining revenues in Georgia could 
well contribute several percentage points to GDP , 
even if these revenues are not registered as part 
of GDP ( if they were registered , they would probably be classified as exports )  . What is observable is 
the additional consumption and imports not only 
of electricity and computer parts but also of more 
general consumption financed by the mining revenues . This increase is similar to the increase in consumption as a result of large inflows of remittances . 
It would be interesting to see how the financing 
of these activities shows up in the balance of payments . Revenues in cryptocurrencies are likely 
exchanged into legal tender at exchanges abroad , 
after which part of the legal tender is transferred 
back to Georgia . 
Investment opportunities in mining cryptocurrencies likely attract foreign direct investment . It is 
too early to draw conclusions about the spillovers 
to other sectors of the economy . It may trigger 
other innovative activities , or it could crowd out 
investments in other activities .

These mining activities illustrate the dynamic response to new opportunities 
by entrepreneurs in the region . They bode well for the development of other applications of these technologies . But the heavy electricity use by companies that 
compete for the right to mine cryptocurrencies is a growing problem . How to 
accommodate and mitigate growing electricity demand from cryptocurrency 
miners and prepare for future declines in demand if mining activities relocate or 
mining stops altogether in its current form are the most urgent challenges as 
these markets develop . 
There are multiple approaches to meeting these challenges . The cryptocurrency community is looking for more efficient ways to update the blockchain . 
Governments are reconsidering their tariff policies ; in order to curtail energy use , 
they need to raise electricity tariffs for miners or create more market-based mechanisms to determine tariffs . If unchecked , electricity use could rise before alternatives are found , possibly resulting in long-term damage to the environment . In 
addition , the fiscal costs of investments in power plants ( or contingent liabilities , 
where new power plants are developed in partnership with the private sector ) 
could threaten public finances if demand for electricity driven by cryptocurrencies collapses . 
Policy challenges
Cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies pose difficult challenges for policy makers . There is no regulatory framework for transfers made with cryptocurrencies or smart contracts . Transfers occur outside anti-money-laundering compliance programs , and smart contracts are not subject to consumer protection 
laws or financial oversight . 
Tax codes do not fully cover the new markets if cryptocurrencies are not recognized in the law as payment systems but are instead viewed as commodities . 
It is difficult to determine the geographic location of the value added created by 
cryptocurrency mining . Tax legislation therefore has to be adjusted to incorporate 
these new activities into direct and indirect tax systems . 
Another ambiguity for policy makers is whether these new activities should 
be supported or constrained . Should they be encouraged because of positive externalities and first-mover benefits ? Or should they be constrained , because they 
crowd out investments with greater social return ? 
Another pertinent question for policy makers is whether and how they can 
use these technologies to improve their own services . 
It is too early to offer specific advice , because there is still great uncertainty 
about the future of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies . But experiences with other digital technologies—such as e-commerce , digital platforms , 
and the sharing economy—suggest that the following general guidelines should 
be followed . 
• Give the new technologies space , and avoid imposing restrictive legislation before 
initial ambiguities are resolved . Even if these technologies are ultimately unsuccessful , the experiments can help develop entrepreneurial skills , put competitive pressure on more traditional activities , and trigger innovations in other 
46 ● World Bank ECA Economic Update May 2018
sectors . A dynamic business climate should encourage innovations , experiments , and risk taking . 
• Make implicit subsidies explicit , and be clear about risks . If activities are not yet 
covered by the tax code or are undertaken in special economic zones , the implicit subsidy and its temporary nature should be calculated and made public . 
Consumers should be warned about risks , such as the risks associated with 
volatile cryptocurrencies . 
• Start planning for leveling the playing field . If these technologies become successful , they should be integrated into the formal economy . Tax codes and regulations should be adjusted , so that both old and new technologies operate on a 
level playing field . 14
• Innovate as government . The corporate motto “ think big , start small , quit soon , 
and scale fast ” is relevant for governments , too . Blockchain technologies provide a stimulus to further digitize government services . Most successful governments are bold in their ideas , know when to terminate experiments that are 
not successful , and have the professionalism to quickly scale small experiments that are promising . 
An undesirable side effect of the cryptocurrencies is the outsized use of electricity in mining . If mining companies pay a lower electricity price than the marginal cost of supplying more electricity , governments should consider raising 
tariffs or at least calculating the implicit subsidy . The sharp increase in electricity 
demand might be an opportunity to develop an electricity market with intra-day 
price fluctuations , so that price differentiation reflects actual costs . Uncertainty 
about future electricity demand for cryptocurrency mining warrants a rethinking 
of contingent liabilities of governments where additional power plants are built 
by public-private partnerships . Guarantees related to future demand for electricity used in cryptocurrency mining are riskier than for other electricity demand . 
At some point , electricity tariffs for mining could be used as indirect taxation of 
the value added created by miners . Although it is difficult to determine the geographic location of the output of these activities , it is easy to locate the inputs . 
Ultimately , financial oversight will cover cryptocurrencies and smart contracts . This process will be a gradual one of trial and error , and it will depend on 
the direction in which blockchain applications develop . First steps have already 
been taken , in the United States ( where bitcoin can be traded on futures markets )  , 
in Switzerland ( where regulation of ICOs was proposed )  , and in the Netherlands 
( where guidance was provided about the tax treatment of cryptocurrency holdings )  . Oversight to prevent money laundering , tax evasion , pump-and-dump 
schemes , and illicit cross-border transfers focuses on transactions in which cryptocurrencies are exchanged for legal tender . 15 At some point , this oversight could 
extend to miners and other companies that update the blockchain . The ultimate 
goal of all these efforts is to create a level playing field , so that blockchain application can be integrated into existing markets . The long-term outcome could be that 
supervision becomes much more effective , because the transparency of the blockchain could provide supervisors and courts with access to real-time information . 
This access would also make it easier to develop valuable early-warning systems . 
Chapter 2 : Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain : Hype or Transformational Technologies ? ● 47
The many experiments and brainstorms by governments and central banks 
throughout the region are inspiring . Just as blockchain opportunities put competitive pressure on private financial sectors , they also trigger creative thinking 
in governments . It is important that these experiments not consider current 
blockchain designs as the full universe of possibilities . Even if decentralized 
maintenance of digital government data can have major advantages , a permissioned system seems much more appropriate and efficient for governments than 
the original system that maintains the blockchain for cryptocurrencies . The ultimate conclusion might even be that other data systems are better suited for specific applications than blockchain technologies , including in the creation of digital currencies by central banks ( box 2 . 4 )  . The flurry of experiments shows the 
success of the blockchain revolution , but it also illustrates that progress may 
come from innovations that are quite different from the original design and objective of the blockchain protocol . 
BOX 2 . 4 Will central banks issue digital currencies ? 
Central banks are exploring the possibility of issuing digital money , for several reasons . First , the 
use of traditional cash is steadily declining ( Rogoff 
2014 )  . Second , cryptocurrencies have provided a 
working digital alternative to cash , replicating the 
original characteristics of cash in digital format . 
Like cash , cryptocurrencies allow anonymous P2P 
transactions without involvement of middlemen . 
Third , demand for tokens that are linked to legal 
tender is increasing . These tokens could be used in 
the same way as cryptocurrencies but without the 
drawback of high volatility in their value . It seems a 
natural development to transform actual coins and 
banknotes into digital tokens with the same legal 
protection and subject to the same price stabilization as all money issued by central banks . a The 
transparency of transactions with central bank digital currencies could facilitate the systematic conduct of monetary policy ( Bordo and Levin 2017 )  . 
There are serious concerns about the issuance 
of digital money by central banks . Digital tokens 
issued by central banks could potentially replace 
not only cash but also electronic payment systems 
operated by commercial banks , which already offer 
electronic accounts , mobile money , and value cards . 
These systems can be uploaded and used offline . 
The Swedish central bank is exploring the possibility of making electronic accounts and value 
cards directly available to the public . The idea is to 
administer this digital money in a central register at 
the central bank . This proposal to replicate instruments that already exist in the private sector stems 
from the understanding that the government has 
the legal obligation to provide means of payment 
to the public . It could , however , undercut the traditional financial intermediation role of commercial 
banks , which transform liquid liabilities into longterm assets . A central bank cannot take over the 
role of pooling liquidity to finance investments . 
If a central bank chose blockchain technologies to administer digital transactions in a decentralized way , it would compete more directly with 
cryptocurrencies , with the advantage of providing 
a token with a more stable value . Still , the system 
would differ fundamentally from the early cryptocurrency protocols . Supply of central bank coins 
would be endogenous—in order to link their value 
to legal tender—and seigniorage would accrue to 
the central bank . Such a system would undoubtedly become a permissioned blockchain , with only 
preselected servers participating ( Danezis and 
Meiklejohn 2016 )  . 
a . Bech and Garratt ( 2017 ) provides a comprehensive overview of the differences between central bank digital currencies and 
cryptocurrencies .

Notes
1 . Electronic accounts are much more popular than cash . Central banks do provide electronic accounts to banks ; they do not yet provide digital cash or electronic accounts directly to the public . 
2 . The public key functions as a pseudonym in communications . The private key is used 
to prove one ’ s identity . If this digital ID becomes a standard on open-source platforms , it 
could make IDs and passwords on proprietary platforms like Facebook or Google redundant . 
3 . See , for example , the Georgian start-up Golden Fleece (  )  . 
4 . Clark ( 2017 ) describes the early history of digital payment systems . 
5 . A bitcoin address is an identifier of 26–35 alphanumeric characters that are equivalent to 
unique IDs . Every transaction is recorded on the public blockchain , so anyone can view 
each address involved in each transaction . However , it is difficult to know the real identity of the people involved in the transactions . For this reason , the bitcoin network is often described as being pseudo-anonymous rather than completely anonymous . 
6 . In the bitcoin protocol , a block can contain about 2 , 000 new transactions . 
7 . The block rewards are hard-coded , but there is no guidance on what the fee should be . 
As miners have discretion over which transactions to include , they select the transactions 
with the highest fees . As the size of each block on the blockchain is limited to 1 MB 
( roughly 2 , 000 transactions )  , if a user wants her transaction to be included in the next 
block , she has to offer a high enough fee so that her transaction is among the approximately 2 , 000 that are selected . 
8 . Other new concepts , often variations of the proof of stake , are proof of activity , proof of 
burn , proof of capacity , and proof of elapsed time ( Rooney 2018 )  . 
9 . The Austrian school and Keynesian economists have long debated the pros and cons of 
private , decentralized money versus government-sanctioned legal tender . What is an 
attraction for one group of economists ( no reliance on governments , which are inclined 
to impose an inflation tax ) is a nightmare for the other ( financial instability , lack of monetary instruments )  . 
10 . ZeroCash (  ) is a good example of a platform that provides 
more encryption . 
11 . Silk Road , an online market for illegal drugs that used bitcoins , started in 2011 . The FBI 
took it down in 2014 . 
12 . The vulnerability of banks in oil-exporting countries after the fall in oil prices was one 
of the reasons for the formation of the Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Association 
( Dyussembekova 2017 )  . 
13 . This project is spearheaded by Pavel Durov , one of the founders of the Russian social 
media platform Vkontakte , and the encrypted messaging app Telegram ( Khrennikov 
and Voitova 2018 )  . 
14 . Carstens ( 2018 ) strongly advocates this point . 
15 . Levin , O ’ Brien , and Zuberi ( 2015 ) discusses the regulation of cryptocurrencies . Bal 
( 2015 ) discusses tax issues . He and others ( 2016 ) provide a comprehensive overview of 
all oversight measures .

Recent developments
Albania ’ s real GDP grew by 3 . 8 percent 
in 2017 , up from 3 . 4 percent in 2016 . Key 
drivers were private investment and consumption . Investment dynamics reflected 
two large energy projects financed by 
FDI ( the Trans -Adriatic Pipeline and a 
hydropower plant )  . Private consumption 
was supported by a recovery in employment , wages and credit . Public consumption made a small contribution to 
growth , reflecting growth of the publicsector wages . High tourism exports and 
recovering commodity exports more than 
compensated for the high investmentrelated imports of machineries and 
equipment as well as for the droughtrelated energy imports . 
Growth stimulated job creation . Employment grew by 2 . 9 percent in the first three 
quarters of 2017 , following a strong expansion of 6 . 5 percent in 2016 . Labor force 
participation increased to 58 percent , up 
by 0 . 4 percentage points year-on-year . 
Besides improved employment prospects , 
the increase in labor force participation 
may reflect the Government ’ s antiinformality campaign – including increased audits and higher penalties for 
non-compliance . The unemployment rate 
declined by 1 . 7 pp to an average of 13 . 9 
percent in the first three quarters of 2017 . 
Real wages in the formal employment 
have started to pick up in 2017 in construction , energy , and tourism . 
Poverty is estimated to have declined as 
growth and employment continued to 
pick up . The poverty rate ( measured as 
US$ 5 . 5 / day , 2011 PPP ) is estimated to 
have decreased in 2017 to 32 . 8 percent , 
compared to 33 . 9 percent in 2016 . Labor 
force participation of women , particularly 
young women , has started to decline 
throughout 2017 , a trend that needs to be 
closely monitored to avoid reversing previous gains . 
Fiscal policy supported a reduction of 
public debt , but the pace of fiscal consolidation slowed in 2017 . The 2017 fiscal deficit is estimated at 2 percent of GDP , slightly above the deficit of 1 . 8 percent in 2016 . 
Revenue gains , from increased economic 
activity and the recovery of commodity 
prices , were estimated at an additional 0 . 9 
percent of GDP in comparison to 2016 . On 
the expenditure side , under-execution of 
public investments and lower interest 
expenditures partially compensated 
drought-related emergency support to the 
electricity sector and higher local governments spending . Prudent fiscal policy 
supported the public debt decline to 71 
percent of GDP in 2017 , compared to 72 . 4 
percent in 2016 . 
The Bank of Albania ’ s ( BoA ) policy stance 
continues to be accommodative and credit 
growth recovers . Average inflation picked 
up to 2 percent in 2017 , but remained below the BoA ’ s 3 percent target , prompting 
no changes in the policy rate , which remains at 1 . 25 percent since May 2016 . Underlying price pressures have remained 
subdued , helped by an appreciation of the 
national currency relative to the euro by 1 . 7 
percent in 2017 . The restructuring of NPLs 
from large borrowers and mandatory write
-offs led to a decline in the NPL ratio to 13 . 2

Growth is estimated to have strengthened 
at 3 . 8 percent in 2017 supported by investments and is projected to moderate to 
3 . 6 percent in 2018 as large FDI-financed 
energy projects wind down ; growth will 
be driven by household consumption , and 
a pickup in exports . Growth created jobs , 
contributing to poverty reduction . Public 
debt declined in 2017 , but the pace of 
fiscal consolidation slowed . Fiscal consolidation , improvement in spending efficiency , and implementation of structural 
reforms remain critical to fostering confidence and growth .

percent of total loans as of December 2017 . 
Low interest rates , progress in dealing with 
NPLs and economic growth stimulated an 
increase of private sector credit issuance by 
13 . 5 percent in 2017 . 
The current account deficit widened in 
2017 . The current account deficit is estimated to have widened , reaching 8 percent of GDP in 2017 . FDI-related investments in the energy sector and droughtrelated electricity imports increased imports . Tourism and commodity prices 
increased the value of exports . The resulting financing needs were covered by significant FDI inflows . With much of the 
financing coming through FDIs , external 
debt declined by 2 percentage points 
reaching 70 . 4 percent of GDP in 2017 . Foreign exchange reserves have remained 
stable , covering 6 ½ months of imports of 
goods and services . 
Outlook
Growth is projected to moderate to 3 . 6 
percent in 2018 , as two large FDI projects 
in the energy sector wind down , and then 
average 3 . 5 percent in the period 2019-20 . 
As the demand stimulus from the large 
energy FDI projects winds down and economic activity increases to close to potential , growth will moderate . Growth will be 
increasingly relying on private consumption , supported by improved labor market 
conditions , and net exports supported by 
improved foreign demand . Investment 
will continue to support growth , reflecting 
a public investment drive to reduce infrastructure gaps and private investment , 
reflecting structural reforms and improvements in the business climate . Labor market improvements will support private 
consumption . Poverty is expected to decline from 31 . 3 percent in 2018 to 29 . 5 percent in 2019 . 
Sustained fiscal consolidation and structural reforms are expected to gradually 
reduce the fiscal deficit to 1 . 5 percent of 
GDP by 2020 , and the debt-to-GDP ratio 
to 60 percent of GDP by 2022 . Under the 
Government medium term fiscal framework , fiscal consolidation will continue 
until 2021 – lowering expenditures on 
personnel , operational and maintenance , 
social outlays and local governments . On 
the revenue side , the introduction of a 
newly valued property tax in 2018 is expected to yield additional revenues . While 
the government is planning sustained 
capital expenditures at 5 percent of GDP 
over the medium term , it has also announced sizable investments financed 
through public private partnerships 
( PPPs ) to be contracted starting from 2018 . 
Risks and challenges
Economic prospects are vulnerable to 
downside risks . Given high public debt , 
the government needs to implement fiscal 
consolidation and strengthen tax compliance to preserve the macro-fiscal stability 
as a foundation for growth . The Government needs to strengthen its PPP management framework to contain fiscal risks 
from PPPs and to ensure that investment 
is cost-effective . Harnessing growth will 
require progress on structural reforms 
improving the business climate - including judiciary , financial and energy reform 
- , strengthening the skills of its labor force 
- and removing barriers to jobs for the 
population . Lower than expected growth 
in trading partners and higher global interest rates are also key risks for Albania ’ s 
growth and public finances . Reforms 
should be informed by equity considerations to ensure continued poverty reduction and inclusion .

Recent developments
Armenia ' s economic performance outperformed expectations in 2017 , recording the 
highest rate of growth since 2007 . Following a flat economic performance in 2016 , 
real GDP expanded by 7 . 5 percent , mainly 
driven by a recovery in the external environment . Growth was also supported by 
a strong rebound in domestic demand . 
Consumption benefited from higher incomes—buoyed by a boost to remittance 
inflows of about 12 percent year on year 
and nominal average wage growth of 3 
percent—which also benefited poor and 
vulnerable households . 
On the production side , growth was driven by a significant expansion in trade ( 16 
percent )  , industry ( 10 percent ) and services ( 9 percent )  . Also the construction 
sector showed modest growth ( 3 percent )  , 
but output remains below its pre-crisis 
level of 2008 . The agriculture sector 
shrunk ( by 4 percent )  , due to unfavorable 
weather conditions . 
A period of deflation came to an end in 
2017 and inflation began rising , reaching 
an annual rate of 2 . 6 percent by year-end , 
within the central bank ' s inflation target of 
4 percent (  +  / - 1 . 5 percentage points )  . Recovering domestic demand , gradually 
rising commodity prices and excise tax 
hikes resulted in higher prices for food , 
beverages , cigarettes , and transport , 
affecting the purchasing power of poor 
and vulnerable groups , which traditionally spend a higher share of their budget on 
these items . 
The fiscal deficit narrowed slightly in 
2017 , to 4 . 7 percent of GDP ( down from 
5 . 5 percent in 2016 )  , but remained wider 
than the budgeted deficit of 2 . 8 percent of 
GDP . While tax revenue increased by 7 . 3 
percent year on year in 2017—driven by 
higher collections of excise taxes , customs 
duties and environmental taxes—as a percentage of GDP revenue declined by 0 . 8 
percentage points compared with 2016 . 
Capital expenditure rose by 36 percent 
year on year in nominal terms , but tight 
control over current spending resulted in 
a decline of 1 . 6 percentage points in overall expenditure as a share of GDP . At the 
end of 2017 , public debt ( including CBA 
debt ) totaled almost 59 percent of GDP . 
The current account deficit continued to 
narrow for a third consecutive year and is 
estimated to have fallen to under 2 percent of GDP in 2017 . The improvement in 
the current account was driven by a 
strong increase in export earnings ( up 25 
percent year on year ) —particularly from 
minerals and processed food products—
robust growth in tourist arrivals and exports of other services ( such as ICT )  , and 
improvement in the income account . The 
strong inflows were partially offset by a 
significant increase in import spending 
( 28 percent year on year )  , a large share of 
which comprised capital imports linked 
to investment . 
Banking sector performance remained 
solid , with a capital adequacy ratio of just 
under 20 percent on average at end-2017 , 
well above the minimum requirement of 
12 percent . At the end of 2017 , the nonperforming loan ratio stood at 5 . 5 percent , 
its lowest level since the 2014 Russian

Firming international metal prices , economic recovery in Russia , and stronger 
domestic demand supported a real GDP 
growth rate of 7 . 5 percent in 2017 , the 
largest annual expansion in a decade . 
Growth in the medium term is projected 
to converge towards its potential of 
around 4 percent , accompanied by a continued ( albeit gradual ) decline in the poverty rate . However , external vulnerabilities and delayed structural reforms could 
undermine economic growth .

crisis . Dollarization ratios for bank deposits and loans declined slightly but remained high at around 60 percent . Total 
lending grew by 10 percent , while the 
Dram lending rate fell by 260 basis points 
over the course of 2017 . 
The economic recovery in 2017 is expected 
to have supported a further reduction in 
poverty rates , which have been on a declining trend since the global economic 
crisis . The absolute poverty rate 
( measured at the 2011 PPP-adjusted 
US$3 . 2 / day poverty line ) is estimated to 
have fallen from 14 . 1 percent in 2016 to 
11 . 6 percent in 2017 . 
Outlook
Armenia ' s economic outlook remains positive . The strong performance in 2017 suggests the opening of a window of opportunity to undertake the reforms needed to 
make growth inclusive and sustainable . 
On the assumption of sustained favorable 
external economic conditions and robust 
structural reforms , medium-term growth 
is forecast to be around the potential 
growth rate ( 4 percent )  , supported by private-sector , export-led activity . In particular , the agribusiness , information and 
communication technology ( ICT )  , and 
tourism sectors are expected to deliver 
solid growth as efforts to boost competitiveness and connectivity start to deliver 
results . As the economy continues to grow 
and incomes rise—and remittance inflows 
continue to support livelihoods thanks to 
a benign external environment—the absolute poverty rate is forecast to decline to 
8 . 1 percent in 2020 . 
Although price pressures are forecast to 
increase in the short term , mainly due to 
higher customs duties and excise taxes on 
fuels starting in 2018 , inflation is projected 
to remain within the official target range . 
The new Tax Code , which becomes fully 
effective in 2018 , lays the foundation for 
better tax administration and higher tax 
revenues . Implementation of the upgraded fiscal rule ( approved in December 
2017 ) will result in stronger discipline for 
current spending and will provide some 
room to increase growth-friendly capital 
expenditures while also stabilizing and 
eventually reducing the public debt . 
Risks and challenges
Armenia ’ s vulnerability to economic conditions in Russia and its other trading 
partners—as well as its low level of export diversification—will remain high . 
Adverse shocks linked to the Russian 
recovery or metal export prices would 
have a negative impact on economic 
growth rates over the near to medium 
term . Fiscal slippage could trigger the 
need for sharper adjustments in public 
spending , undermining domestic demand 
and real economic activity . Fiscal policy 
should remain prudent to contain public 
debt levels . Avoiding fiscal procyclicality 
will help prevent macroeconomic imbalances and reduce the risks associated 
with overheating ( including potential 
competitiveness losses ) during periods of 
strong economic growth . Continuing coordination with the monetary authorities 
and the maintenance of a flexible exchange rate will be vital to avoid episodes 
of real exchange rate appreciation that 
can lead to losses in competitiveness . 
Sustaining robust economic growth will 
require bold structural reforms—such as 
providing a fair and competitive business 
and investment environment—to address 
fundamental problems in Armenia ' s economy . Increasing country-wide access to
economic opportunities will help to boost 
household incomes and drive a further 
reduction in poverty , particularly in secondary cities where poverty is highest .

Recent developments
The Azerbaijani economy had a very modest recovery in 2017 , as a rebound in the 
non-oil economy was offset by a contraction in the oil sector due to substantial 
OPEC-led cuts in oil production and capacity constraints . In particular , the nonoil sector rebounded by 2 . 7 percent yearon-year ( y / y )  , supported by benign public 
financing , stronger external demand , and 
improved confidence in response to recovering oil prices . With the exception of the 
construction sector , output increased in all 
non-oil sectors with strong y / y growth 
recorded in transport ( 8 . 5 percent )  , information and communication technologies 
( 6 . 6 percent )  , tourism ( 5 . 9 percent ) and 
agriculture ( 4 . 2 percent )  . On the downside , and despite higher oil prices , oil GDP 
contracted by 5 percent y / y . 
Annual end-year inflation declined from 
15 . 6 percent in 2016 to 7 . 9 percent in 2017 , 
as the effect of the exchange rate passthrough and the impact of administrative 
tariffs dissipated . The high inflation rate 
recorded for food items ( 9 . 4 percent y / y ) 
was due to a strong external demand for 
agricultural products . To curb inflation , 
the central bank continued to tighten the 
monetary policy stance by actively absorbing manat liquidity through the use of 
deposit auction operations and the issuance of notes . 
Higher oil prices , sluggish import growth , 
and expanded non-oil exports helped to 
improve Azerbaijan ’ s balance of payments 
in 2017 . Exports expanded by 50 percent 
y / y , led by a rise in oil exports , as oil prices recovered ( oil exports accounted for 90 
percent of total exports )  , while imports 
rebounded by 3 percent y / y ( compared to 
a drop in 2016 )  . Non-oil exports increased 
by 22 percent y / y , supported by stronger 
external demand , mainly from Russia . The 
current account recorded an estimated 
surplus of 4 . 3 percent of GDP in 2017 . 
The tightening monetary policy , improved 
external environment , and transfers from 
the Oil Fund to the central bank helped to 
maintain a broadly stable exchange rate at 
1 . 7 AZN per USD in 2017 . As a result , the 
central bank ’ s reserves increased by 34 
percent y / y in 2017 and totaled US$5 . 3 
billion by end-2017 . The Oil Fund ’ s assets 
rose by 8 . 02 percent y / y and totaled US$ 
35 . 8 billion ( about 87% of GDP ) in January 
2018 , mainly due to higher oil prices and a 
portfolio revaluation . 
In June 2017 , the Government of Azerbaijan ( GoA ) relaxed its fiscal consolidation 
program , and public spending was revised up to primarily inject capital equivalent to 0 . 7 percent of GDP in the Azerbaijan Deposit Insurance Fund1 . Higher 
budget spending is estimated to have widened the consolidated fiscal deficit 
( comprising State Budget , the Oil Fund , 
the Social Protection Fund and the Nakhchivan Government ) from a nearly balanced position in 2016 to a deficit of 1 . 5 
percent of GDP in 2017 . 
There were signs of recovery in Azerbaijan ’ s financial sector in 2017 , supported by 
the stabilization of the manat exchange 
rate and growth across the non-oil sectors . 
The level of non-performing loans is reported to have dropped from 33 percent

Azerbaijan ’ s economy had a very modest 
recovery in 2017 . Benign public financing , improved confidence , and a favorable 
external environment supported non-oil 
economic growth , but this was offset by 
an OPEC-led decline in oil production . 
Going forward , growth is expected to 
strengthen , driven mainly by a fiscal 
stimulus , a rise in hydrocarbon prices , 
and an increase in gas exports . Social 
conditions remain a major source of concern , as real wages and spending on social 
protection programs declined in 2017 .

in 1Q2016 to 19 percent in 4Q2017 , thanks 
to the restructuring ( largely at fiscal cost )  . 
The restructuring of the largest bank —
the state-owned International Bank of 
Azerbaijan ( IBA ) —was completed . IBA ’ s 
external liabilities worth US$3 . 3 billion 
were converted into longer-term liabilities 
and the sovereign debt . 
High inflation adversely affected household incomes and reduced the real purchasing power . In 2017 , the increase in the 
minimal cost of living and nominal average wages by 11 . 6 percent y / y and 6 percent y / y , respectively , was not sufficient to 
compensate for higher prices . As a result , 
poverty likely increased in 2017 and was 
probably worsened by the 50-percent cut 
in the coverage of the country ’ s most important social assistance program . 
Outlook
Azerbaijan ’ s economy is projected to expand by 1 . 8 percent y / y in 2018 , supported mainly by the fiscal stimulus . The 
growth is expected to accelerate in the 
medium term , driven by an expansion of 
natural gas production , as the main pipeline that will deliver gas to Europe from 
the Shah-Deniz II field will be operational 
by end-2018 . Since the OPEC-deal is extended until the end of 2018 , Azerbaijan ’ s 
crude oil output is not expected to decline 
much further . Moreover , average oil prices will firm up somewhat in 2018 relative 
to 2017 and are projected to stabilize at 
robust levels in the medium term . Non-oil 
GDP growth is expected to accelerate in 
2018 , fueled by an 83-percent y / y increase 
in budgeted public investment . Nevertheless , growth in the non-oil economy is 
expected to remain moderate due to a 
protracted recovery of the banking sector 
and a weak business environment . 
The GoA plans a fiscal stimulus in 2018 
through boosting capital spending , which 
will be primarily financed by an increase 
in budget transfers from the sovereign 
wealth fund . The consolidated fiscal balance is likely to be slightly positive in 2018 
and is estimated to average 1 . 3 percent of 
GDP in the medium term , as oil prices 
remain firm and gas exports rise . 
To contain inflation , the central bank 
needs to continue tightening monetary 
policy . Azerbaijan ’ s external sector is expected to continue to improve due to an 
increase in hydrocarbon production and a 
continuation of non-oil export growth , 
supported by a rise in external demand 
and enhanced government support to 
exporters of non-oil products . However , 
spending cuts on social protection , as well 
as a moderate economic recovery , are not 
conducive to poverty reduction . 
Risks and challenges
Following the recovery in oil prices after 
the 2014-16 shock , the likelihood of a procyclical economic policy rather than economic reforms to stimulate growth is rising . The main challenge is to preserve the 
reform momentum induced by the shock 
and strengthen institutions to ensure the 
resilience of the economy to future external shocks . Moreover , progress on the 
structural reform agenda to stimulate private-sector participation and jobs creation 
remains limited . An adaptive and effective 
social protection system and programs 
aimed at productive inclusion of poor and 
vulnerable households are needed to reduce poverty .

Recent developments
The modest cyclical expansion continues , 
supported by improving external conditions and recovery in industry . In 2017 , 
the economy grew at 2 . 4 percent y / y , a 
rebound from the contraction of 
2 . 5 percent y / y in 2016 . Modest economic 
growth in Russia and a gradual increase 
in commodity prices boosted merchandize 
exports and supported an increase in domestic business activity . On the demand 
side , real wage increases helped to increase household consumption by almost 
6 percent in 3Q 2017 ( vs . 6 . 5 percent fall in 
3Q 2016 )  . In the same period , growth of 
gross fixed capital formation recovered to 
1 . 8 percent – mainly due to rebound of 
public investment – versus the dramatic 
fall by 18 . 9 percent in 3Q 2016 . 
In 2017 , annual average inflation slowed 
to 4 . 6 percent helped by better anchored 
inflation expectations , moderation in administrative price adjustments , and imported disinflation . Moderating inflation 
has allowed the National Bank to cut its 
benchmark rate from 17 to 10 . 5 percent 
during 2017 , leading to an almost twofold 
reduction in nominal lending rates in national currency . As a result , supply of new 
credit in nominal terms went up by almost 
30 percent y / y . However , NPL levels remain at around 13 percent and a comprehensive NPL resolution mechanism is still 
not put in place . 
Quasi-fiscal expenditures continue to put 
pressures on public debt levels and external financing needs . Recorded primary 
budget surplus has been spent on repayment and servicing public debt in foreign 
currency , which amounted to 
US$3 . 26 billion , or 6 . 9 percent of GDP . 
Pressures were partially eased by the disbursement of the two tranches of the 
EFSD loan ( totaling US$600 million )  , disbursement of a bilateral loan from Russia 
( US$700 million )  , and the issuance of Eurobonds—US$1 . 4 billion in 2017 , and 
US$0 . 6 billion in February 2018 . Exports 
recovered , helping to bring down the current account deficit to 1 . 1 percent of GDP 
in January-November 2017 ( vs 3 . 2 percent 
a year ago )  , yet driven by the primary 
income deficit of 4 percent of GDP . 
Real wage increases have stopped the 
deterioration of household incomes . In 
2017 , real wages and disposable incomes 
grew by 6 . 2 and 2 . 4 percent respectively , 
benefiting from lower inflation . Disposable incomes growth was the highest in 
Minsk , but also in regions with higher 
absolute poverty rates , such as Brest and 
Gomel . The hires-to-terminations ratio 
throughout 2017 exceeded that of 2016 by 
an average of 12 percent . The share of 
households below the official poverty 
threshold remained stable throughout the 
first three quarters of 2017 . 
Outlook
While the recovery is underway , annual 
economic growth rates are unlikely to exceed 3 percent . Improved household consumption and investment activity , along 
with gradual increase in exports , will help

Improving external conditions , stronger 
domestic demand , and prudent macroeconomic policies supported a cyclical recovery in 2017 and early 2018 . Real incomes 
started to pick up , but accelerated wage 
growth , along with other fiscal stimulus , 
could pose risks to macro stability . Rising 
public debt levels and continued dependence on external financing make the economy vulnerable to macroeconomic shocks . 
The revival of economic growth requires 
addressing structural bottlenecks impeding productivity improvements .

the economy to grow . At the same time , 
persisting domestic structural bottlenecks 
related to unaddressed legacy issues of 
misallocation of capital and low export 
diversification will continue to constrain 
the growth potential . Weak foundations 
for a sustainable growth recovery imply 
that income per capita gaps between Belarus and its neighbors may widen as the 
economies of the Baltic States and Poland 
are projected to grow on average above 
3 percent per annum . At the same time , 
modest growth would ease balance-ofpayment pressures , allowing to maintain a 
current account deficit between 2 and 
3percent of GDP over the next three years . 
Risks and challenges
Downside risks from external factors are 
coming from two sources . First , although 
the headline current account deficits have 
narrowed down , a public debt to GDP ratio 
is likely to remain close to a half of GDP in 
the medium term . Majority of gross external debt pertains to the public sector and is 
characterized by a heavy and uneven debt 
service profile with repayment peaks every 
few years . As the public debt is largely 
denominated in foreign currency , there is a 
risk of disorderly adjustment in external 
imbalance due to tightening of global financial conditions . Second , Belarus remains vulnerable to changes in global commodity prices and in terms of its energy 
trade policy with Russia . 
Either of these developments would make 
it harder for the government to generate 
the foreign currency needed to service its 
debt . Belarus ’ s experience with the 2017 
Eurobond issuance indicates that access to 
external market financing – in contrast to 
loans from Russia and China – comes at a 
high cost . A ten-year , US$0 . 6 billion 
tranche was priced at 7 . 625 percent , higher rates than the ones obtained by emerging economies . In 2018 , the Government 
will allocate US$3 . 1 billion for external 
public debt repayments and service ( or 
about 5 . 4 percent of forecasted GDP )  , 
while domestic obligations of the Government denominated in foreign currency 
add another US$0 . 7 billion ( or about 1 . 2 
percent of GDP )  . 
Downside risks from domestic factors 
relate to a possibility of a disorderly unwinding of financial sector imbalances if 
mechanisms for addressing insolvent 
SOEs and NPL resolution are not put in 
place . In addition , there are risks to fiscal 
sustainability arising from existing quasifiscal deficits related to the excesses of the 
expansionary policies of the past . Reintroduction of short-term demand stimulus is 
risky , leaving little prospects for improving enterprise performance and strengthening of financing sector . The effects of 
lower interest rates are limited , as highly 
indebted enterprises are unable to invest 
more . Boosting productivity of available 
capital and labor remains a sustainable 
way to overcome prolonged stagnation of 
growth and incomes .

Recent developments
Growth reached an estimated 3 percent in 
2017 . Domestic demand remains the dominant driver of growth with consumption
adding 3pp , investment 0 . 8 pp and imports 5 . 1pp . Improved external demand 
has supported exports growth , but a 
strong rise in imports is offsetting this 
momentum . With negative overall net 
exports , they are estimated to have subtracted from growth ( -0 . 8 pp )  . Unemployment remains high , although some 
improvements are observed in the labor 
market . The unemployment rate fell from 
25 . 4 percent in 2016 to 20 . 5 in 2017 , driven 
by a fall in activity rate and a slight rise in 
employment . The decrease in unemployment was more pronounced among workers with primary education ( from 26 percent in 2016 to 18 percent in 2017 )  , which 
should have made poverty recede in 2017 . 
After almost two years of deflation , inflation started to pick up in 2017 , owing 
mainly to the recovery of global oil price . 
The consumer price index increased by 
1 . 2 percent year-on-year ( y-o-y ) in December 2017 . The biggest driver of the 
increase was transport , tobacco and rental 
housing . In contrast , prices decreased 
notably on alcohol , clothing , and telecommunication services . Given similar 
growth in nominal salaries , the effect on 
real incomes was neutral . 
In 2017 , the fiscal balance is expected to 
remain in surplus . The latest consolidated 
data project a 2 . 0 percent of GDP surplus 
in 2017 , up from a deficit of 0 . 3 percent in 
2016 . In 2017 , revenues rose mainly due 
to stronger collection of indirect taxes 
while expenditure declined mainly because of continued restraint on current 
government spending . At the same time , 
sluggish capital spending reflected implementation delays . 
Current expenditures are expected to remain on a downward , driven by the commitment of the authorities to reduce the 
wage bill . Total public debt in 2017 remained at 37 percent of GDP ( external 
public debt was 27 percent of GDP ) and 
consisted largely of concessional debt to 
international financial institutions . 
The latest available poverty data using the 
national poverty line is for 2015 and was 
estimated at 16 percent , very close to the 
15 percent poverty rate estimated for 2011 . 
Rural poverty ( 19 percent ) was higher 
than urban poverty ( 12 percent )  . Behind 
the minimal movement in poverty in 2011
-2015 there was a small positive effect of 
pensions on household incomes , countered mainly by a decrease in employment 
rate and a decline in self-employment 
earnings . The implementation of new labor laws in both BiH entities , and continuation of support schemes for first-time job 
seekers are expected to improve labor 
markets outcomes in the coming years , 
hence also supporting poverty reduction . 
Outlook
Supported primarily by consumption and 
to some extent by public investment , economic growth is projected to strengthen to

Economic growth in Bosnia and Herzegovina ( BiH )  , which reached an estimated 
3 percent in 2017 , is expected to pick-up 
starting in 2018 with the implementation 
of structural reforms and heavy infrastructure investment . Translating this 
growth into improvements in labor markets will be critical to observe declines in 
poverty . As BiH enters general elections 
year , political turmoil may be a risk for 
economic growth .

about 4 percent by 2020 . As the BiH ’ s reform agenda advances , a moderate rise in 
exports is expected , but strong demand 
for imports implies that net external demand will continue to be a drag on 
growth . Remittances are likely to remain 
stable , and , together with progress on 
reforms , will underpin a gradual pickup 
in consumption , which will remain a major driver of growth . Investments in energy , construction , and tourism will support 
investment growth generally , as well as 
job creation in those sectors . Because of 
these dynamics , real GDP growth is projected to build up gradually from 3 percent in 2017 to 3 . 2 percent in 2018 and up 
to 4 percent in 2020 . 
As poverty is strongly associated with 
unemployment and inactivity in BiH , for 
economic growth to translate into poverty reduction , improvements in labor 
market participation and employment 
will remain key . However , with high 
unemployment and the expectations of 
flat real wages due to the substantial 
remaining slack in the labor market , 
poverty is projected to decline only slowly over the next couple of years . 
The current account deficit ( CAD ) is forecast to rise slightly in 2018 as both imports 
and exports started to pick up in 2017 . In 
the medium run , with improved progress 
on ongoing structural reforms and higher 
demand for foreign savings , CAD is expected to deteriorate from 5 . 8 percent of 
GDP in 2017 to 6 . 8 percent of GDP by 
2020 . Overall , in the medium term both 
fiscal and external deficits will persist until 2020 . 
Risks and challenges
Achieving prudent , efficient , and effective 
fiscal policy , addressing persistent unemployment and continuing to safeguard the 
banking sector , will remain central to the 
BiH reform agenda . Although external 
deficits continue to be moderate , on the 
fiscal side the tax burden is high , and public spending is inefficient , as evidenced by 
poorly-targeted benefits . Fiscal consolidation and provision of an effective safety 
net will not be effective if structural rigidities in spending are not addressed—
especially the high public wage bill . However , support from the international partners can help the BiH authorities to deliver on their challenging reform agenda . 
Without continued implementation of 
structural reforms , it would be difficult to 
address rigidities in public employment , 
pensions , and debt . 
There are notable risks , both domestic and 
external . The main domestic risk is the 
challenging political environment , which 
makes structural reforms difficult in such 
areas as infrastructure , telecommunications , energy sector , and transport . It also 
raises risks to the economic outlook . Despite some delays , BiH has submitted a 
detailed Questionnaire to the European 
Commission , a major step towards becoming a candidate country . Main external 
risk for BiH remains slow growth in the 
EU and rising inflation in developed 
countries and interest rates .

Recent developments
Economic growth remained strong in Bulgaria at 3 . 6 percent in 2017 , only slightly 
lower than 3 . 9 percent in 2016 . Consumption and investment were the main drivers 
of growth while the contribution of net 
exports was negative in 2017 . Consumption was supported by a dynamic labor 
market , rising wages , and eased financial 
credit conditions . Investment expanded at 
a solid rate , despite slow implementation 
of public investment projects . On the production side , the greatest contributions to 
GDP growth came from manufacturing ; 
construction ; real estate ; trade , transport , 
and tourism . 
Strong domestic demand and higher energy and commodity prices pushed inflation 
up . After three years of deflation , inflation 
turned positive to 2 . 1 percent in 2017 . 
Fiscal performance remained positive on 
the back of improved revenue collection 
and lower than planned public investment 
spending . Tax revenues grew by 10 percent in 2017 compared with 2016 thanks to 
strong economic activity , better compliance , higher minimum wages and an increase in the pension contribution rate . 
Like 2016 , capital investment was well 
below expectations as implementation of 
EU funded projects remained slow . Instead of planned deficit of 0 . 6 percent of 
GDP , fiscal accounts were balanced for the 
second year in a row . 
The current account surplus narrowed 
to 3 . 9 percent of GDP in 2017 compared with 5 . 3 percent in 2016 following the deterioration of the trade balance and lower EU transfers . 
At 72 . 1 percent , the employment rate ( 20-
64 ) reached record high levels while unemployment was close to pre-crisis levels . 
However , the working age population 
continued to shrink constraining the expansion of potential growth . Labor and 
skill shortages as well as rising minimum 
wages pushed overall salaries up about 9 
percent compared with 2016 . 
Strong labor market conditions supported 
continued improvement in poverty reduction . Poverty measured using the Upper 
Middle-Income Class line of $5 . 5 per day 
( in 2011 PPP terms ) is estimated to have 
declined from 8 . 5 percent in 2015 to 7 . 5 
percent in 2017 ( see Notes to Table 2 )  . 
However , income inequality in Bulgaria is 
the highest in the EU and has been increasing over the last few years , with the income of the richest 20 percent of the population equal to almost eight times that of 
the poorest 20 percent in 2015 . The coverage and adequacy of the social transfer 
system remains low . Unemployment has 
declined significantly but regional variations and long-term and youth unemployment remain high . Inactivity among certain groups of the population persists and 
many citizens – including the elderly , people living in rural areas , and the Roma –
are excluded from economic opportunities . 
Outlook
GDP growth is expected to remain robust , 
reaching 3 . 8 percent in 2018 . Domestic

Economic growth remained strong in 
2017 , slightly lower compared with 2016 . 
The employment rate peaked and wages 
were pushed up by labor and skill shortages . Output and employment growth 
contributed to a reduction in poverty . 
Further gains in growth , poverty reduction and shared prosperity hinge on the 
implementation of policies to boost 
productivity . Policy areas that require 
attention include strengthening institutions , enhancing the skills of the labor 
force , and improving the effectiveness 
and efficiency of public spending .

demand will continue to support growth 
as the expected intensified absorption of 
EU funds will boost investment , likely 
outweighing the negative contribution of 
net exports . Private consumption is expected to continue expanding thanks to 
tight labor markets and rising real estate 
prices in large cities . Going forward , 
GDP growth is projected to moderate to 
3 . 6 percent in 2019 and 2020 . Domestic 
demand should remain the driver of 
growth with an increasing contribution 
of investment . 
The current account balance is likely to 
remain in surplus , but narrow net exports will continue to deteriorate and an 
expected slowdown in EU growth due to 
higher oil and commodity prices . 
The fiscal position is likely to weaken 
slightly in 2018 and 2019 , reflecting plans 
for expansion of public investment and 
increasing wages and social assistance 
payments . Strong revenue collection , driven by further improvements in compliance and an increased pension contribution rate in 2018 , is likely to support fiscal 
consolidation in the medium term . Lack of 
improvement in spending efficiency in 
health , public order , and infrastructure 
could undermine fiscal consolidation and 
limit the potential of public spending to 
enhance growth . 
Poverty reduction is expected to continue 
at a modest pace in the near term . Sustained improvements in employment and 
wages , as well as recent increases in the 
minimum pension , should support real 
incomes and therefore further reductions 
in poverty . Poverty is projected to fall 
from 7 . 5 percent in 2017 , as measured at 
$5 . 5 a day in 2011 PPP , to 7 . 0 percent in 
2018 , and to 6 . 3 percent by 2020 . 
Risks and challenges
Risks to the projected growth path are 
broadly balanced . Lower than expected 
European growth could undermine export 
growth , while tightening global financial 
market conditions could increase the cost 
of lending to the private sector with negative implications for investment . Continued 
wage growth at a faster pace than productivity could translate into increasing unit 
labor costs and therefore undermine competitiveness . Further acceleration of real 
estate prices in large cities could negatively affect the quality of bank portfolios . 
Upside factors likely to lead to higherthan expected growth are an enhanced 
economic sentiment in Europe and stronger global economic activity . 
The key challenges for Bulgaria are to 
accelerate convergence with the rest of the 
EU and to build a more inclusive society . 
Accelerating convergence requires improvements in productivity and labor 
force participation as the demographic 
transition is weighing on the size of the 
working age population . Enhancing 
productivity growth requires addressing 
governance challenges ( public administration , judiciary , business environment , 
governance of SOEs ) that have undermined Bulgaria ’ s structural transformation . Enhancing the skills and employability of all Bulgarians , more effective
and efficient public spending on health , 
pensions and long-term care are also 
needed to ensure inclusiveness and sustainability of growth in the face of demographic changes .

Recent developments
GDP growth slowed from 3 . 2 percent in 
2016 to 2 . 8 percent in 2017 . Exports of 
goods and services was the main driver of 
growth in 2017 . Tourism recorded exceptional performance with foreign tourist 
nights rising by over 11 percent , and 
strong growth of merchandise export continued . Private consumption also made a 
positive contribution to growth , supported 
by favorable labor market developments 
and personal income tax rate cuts . However , the share of imported durable goods in 
consumption increased . On balance , the 
effect of net exports on growth turned negative . In addition , growth slowed down 
because investment growth decelerated 
markedly . This was mainly due to a weaker absorption of EU funds , which led to a 
sharp fall in government investments . 
Following deflationary pressures in 2016 , 
prices increased by 1 . 1 percent y-o-y in 
2017 on the back of the recovery of international oil and food prices . With inflation 
still subdued , the Croatian National Bank 
( CNB ) continued to pursue an expansionary monetary policy throughout 2017 . 
Fiscal consolidation also continued in 
2017 , with the budget surplus estimated at 
0 . 1 percent of GDP , down from a deficit of 
0 . 9 percent in 2016 . The surplus was 
achieved by buoyant tax collection and 
constrained growth in expenditures in line 
with the November 2017 budget revision . 
The combination of a significant primary 
surplus and a small debt reducing interest
-rate growth differential resulted in a 
stronger than expected fall in the government ’ s debt ratio to 80 percent of GDP in 
2017 , down from 82 . 7 in 2016 . 
External imbalances narrowed further as 
the current account surplus increased to 
3 . 7 percent of GDP in September 2017 ( on 
a four-quarter basis )  . This rise is expected 
to be only temporary , as it reflects a fall in 
banks ’ profits resulting from their exposures to Agrokor Group . External debt ( of 
the public and private sectors ) declined to 
84 . 2 percent of GDP in November 2017 , 
5 . 6 percent lower than 2016 , as banks and 
the private corporate sector continued to 
deleverage . 
Employment rose across the board , with 
manufacturing , tourism and construction 
accounting for more than a half of the 
increase . Together with negative migration flows , this led to a marked decline of 
the survey-based unemployment rate to 
an estimated 11 percent in 2017 , down 
from 13 . 1 percent in 2016 . Real net wages 
increased by 4 . 2 percent y-o-y in December . The positive wage trends are due the 
recovery of firms ' profitability , labor 
shortages in some sectors , a 6-percent rise 
in public sector wages and cuts in the personal income tax rate . 
Economic recovery and labor market 
improvements are now starting to reduce absolute poverty , after increasing 
during six subsequent years of economic 
recession . The poverty rate measured at 
the upper middle-income class poverty 
line of $5 . 5 at 2011 PPP per capita fell 
from 7 . 3 percent in 2013 to 5 . 8 percent in 
2015 , which is still higher than the precrisis rate . The poverty rate for 2017 is 
projected at 5 . 1 percent , suggesting that

Economic growth decelerated to 2 . 8 percent in 2017 due to a slowdown in government investment and a rebound in 
imports . The poverty rate is projected to 
have declined to 5 . 1 percent as disposable 
incomes have increased . Strong fiscal consolidation continued in 2017 , leading to a 
further fall in the debt ratio . However , the 
reform momentum has faltered and , without addressing substantial economic and 
institutional weaknesses , prospects for 
reinitiating real convergence and promoting inclusive growth are weak .

the reduction in poverty is slowing down . 
While real per capita income has returned 
to its 2008 level , output is still about 4 
percent lower than in 2008 . Therefore , the 
rebound in per capita income reflects the 
impact of demographic trends . 
Outlook
Growth is expected to slow further to 2 . 6 
percent in 2018 , due to a slowdown in 
private consumption as the favorable 
effects of the tax reform on real wages 
start to fade . Furthermore , exports of tourist services are expected to slow in 2018 , 
due to capacity constraints . On the other 
hand , better absorption of EU funds will 
give a boost to investment spending . 
These trends suggest an average economic 
growth of 2 . 8 percent for 2019 and 2020 . 
The government balance is expected to 
stay in surplus and may reach 1 percent by 
2020 , leading to a further decline in public 
debt to below 70 percent of GDP . However , the overall fiscal stance will become 
moderately pro-cyclical , as the structural 
budget balance is expected to worsen . 
Positive labor market developments are 
expected to support the growth of disposable income for all segments of the welfare distribution . The continued decline in 
the share of long-term unemployed and 
NEETs will reduce the absolute poverty 
rate further to 4 . 0 percent in 2020 . 
Risks and challenges
Risks are slightly skewed to the downside . 
As the operational restructuring of Agrokor Group unfolds in 2018 , the negative 
effects on investment activity and private 
consumption might be greater than currently envisaged . In addition , although 
the positive contribution of exports of 
goods to GDP growth is expected to stay 
high , it is exposed to the risk of a slowdown in external demand from the EU . 
Furthermore , the still high level of public 
debt makes Croatia vulnerable to interest 
rate shocks and worsening external financing conditions . Finally , the cyclical 
upturn and the sounder fiscal position 
may foster continued complacency . The 
lack of reforms would have an adverse 
effect on growth over the medium term . 
Croatia ’ s prospects for improving higher 
and more inclusive growth remain weak . 
Currently low potential growth calls for a 
strong structural reform agenda . Substantial economic , social and institutional 
weaknesses should be addressed to boost 
private sector productivity and competitiveness , raise the quality of human and 
physical capital and modernize public 
services . This would lead to increasing 
economic activity and employment , 
which are crucial for a further reduction 
in poverty .

Recent developments
The economy performed well in 2017 . 
GDP growth improved markedly to 5 
percent—from 2 . 8 percent in 2016—led by 
an improved external environment . Prudent macro-fiscal policies helped preserve 
fiscal space and supported price stability . 
Inflation spiked to 6 . 7 percent ( eop ) in 
2017 in response to higher excise taxes on 
tobacco and fuel , but dropped to below 3 
percent in February 2018 . With inflation 
above the ceiling of its target range in 2017 
and rapid credit growth , the NBG increased the policy rate by 0 . 75 bps to 7 . 25 
percent over 2017 . 
Georgia ’ s external position improved 
considerably . Export of goods expanded 
by 24 percent on the back of strong demand from Russia , Azerbaijan , Ukraine , 
China , and the US ; tourism proceeds rose 
by 27 percent ; and worker ’ s remittances 
increased by 21 percent in 2017 . Import 
growth was relatively lower , reflecting 
gradually the firming oil prices . Gross 
FDI inflows increased in 2017 to 12 . 3 percent of GDP , helping strengthen the international reserve position , which stood at 
4 months of imports of goods and services . Total external debt remained high 
at 112 percent of GDP at the end September 2017 . 
Fiscal policy was prudent . Despite eliminating the income tax on reinvested 
profits starting in 2017 , revenues increased by 11 percent . To prioritize social and infrastructure spending , the 
authorities generated savings of about 
0 . 8 percentage points of GDP from reduced administrative costs in 2017 . This 
helped to scale up public investments to 
8 . 3 percent of GDP and slightly narrow 
fiscal deficit to 3 . 8 percent of GDP from 
the 3 . 9 percent observed in 2016 . Georgia ’ s 
public debt remained sustainable at 44 
percent of GDP as of end-2017 . 
The banking sector is well capitalized , 
profitable and with low non-performing 
loans ( NPLs )  , although structural vulnerabilities persist . The sector yielded a return 
on assets of 2 . 8 percent and a return on 
equity of over 20 percent as of end-2017 . 
Also by December 2017 , NPLs represented 
only 2 . 4 percent of gross loans , down from 
3 . 6 percent as of end-2016 . At the same 
time , systemic vulnerabilities persist , including the large market concentration by 
the top two banks , the high retail loan 
growth ( including by non-bank financial 
institutions )  , and elevated dollarization , 
against the backdrop of deficient financial 
safety nets . NBG plans to address the 
latter issues with the support from the WB 
and IMF . 
Poverty is estimated to have fallen in 2017 , 
driven by an increase of employment opportunities related to the expansion of the 
construction and services sectors , resuming the decreasing trend started in 2010 
( and which stalled in 2016 )  . The spike in 
inflation in 2017 may have offset—albeit 
to a minor extent—the positive effect of 
employment on poverty by reducing 
households ’ purchasing power . The most 
recent poverty figures available for the 
country are for the year 2016 , when poverty was estimated at 17 percent using the 
lower-middle income .

Georgia ’ s growth accelerated to 5 . 0 percent in 2017 , on the back of an improved 
external environment . In 2018 growth is 
projected at 4 . 5 percent , led by investment . The fiscal deficit declined to 3 . 8 
percent of GDP in 2017 , slightly improving from 2016 ; while fiscal consolidation 
will continue in 2018 , public investment 
is expected to remain robust . Poverty is 
expected to return to its declining trend 
as economic growth recovers and translates into higher income .

Outlook
Georgia ’ s growth outlook over the medium term is positive . The more benign external environment should facilitate the 
development of private sector-led export 
sectors , encourage FDI , and support consumption from still robust remittances . A 
steady implementation of the reform program will result in a further acceleration 
of growth over the medium term to 5 percent by 2020 , particularly by enhancing 
productivity . Inflation is envisaged to 
remain well contained , converging to the 
NBG ’ s target of 3 percent by year-end 
2018 , while the current account deficit 
would narrow to below 9 percent of GDP 
by 2020 . 
Considerable consolidation of administrative spending , streamlining of subsidies 
and a more efficient social safety net will 
help to achieve medium-term fiscal consolidation while providing space for capital spending . Current spending is projected to decline from 24 . 5 percent of GDP in 
2017 to 23 percent in 2020 , primarily by 
containing the wage bill and administrative expenses—which rose steadily and 
steeply for at least 4 years—and better 
targeting of subsidies and social assistance 
programs . The fiscal deficit of the general 
government will be gradually reduced to 
3 . 0 percent of GDP by 2020 keeping public 
debt stable . Still , fiscal slippages , or accumulation of new liabilities or materialization of contingent liabilities may compromise the expected consolidation and result 
in higher debt burden . 
Continuous expansion of the economy in 
upcoming years should lead to more employment opportunities and further poverty reduction . Employment opportunities 
outside agriculture in rural areas ( in particular ) will play a critical role in leading 
to significant reductions in lagging regions . Pensions and social assistance are 
expected to play a much smaller role for 
poverty reduction in upcoming years , in 
contrast to the 2010-2015 period , given the 
more limited fiscal space . 
Risks and challenges
Georgia ’ s quasi-fiscal risks emanating 
from the contingent liabilities of the StateOwned Enterprises ( SOEs ) are substantial 
and a source of vulnerability . The Fiscal 
Risks Annex to the 2018 Budget Law suggests that the liabilities of the 76 high and 
medium risk SOEs are around 20 percent 
of GDP . Additional risks stem from contingent liabilities generated by the government ’ s Power Purchasing Agreements 
( PPAs )  . At the end-2017 there were 72 
signed PPAs , in which the state issues 
guarantees to purchase excess electricity 
from operators on a seasonal basis . While 
the fiscal risks of PPAs exist , the needs for 
additional power capacity are also evident from the consumption growth trend . 
The Government is committed to review 
carefully its decisions going forward , 
ensuring compliance of new PPAs with 
the draft Law on Public Private Partnerships that is expected to be approved and 
enacted in 2018 . 
As a very open economy , Georgia is vulnerable to regional developments given its 
historically high current account deficit , 
and the risks of export demand and remittances shock . The downside risks to 
the baseline scenario are associated with 
further tightening of US monetary policy 
and Lari depreciation ; deterioration in the 
external environment ( including due to a 
weaker EU outlook ) and regional geopolitical tensions . 
Rural poverty and high poverty rates in 
lagging regions also remain a challenge . 
Providing employment opportunities and 
raising agricultural productivity will be 
critical to address them .

Recent developments
Following two years of weak growth , Kazakhstan ’ s economy recovered in 2017 . 
Real GDP growth accelerated to 4 percent 
in 2017 , up from 1 . 1 percent in 2016 . Oil 
production , which rose by 10 . 5 percent 
year on year in 2017 , was the primary 
driver of this improvement . The increase 
in oil output was observed in the oil fields 
that were not covered by the OPEC-led 
cuts in 2017 . Together with more favorable terms of trade , it generated positive 
spillover effects to the manufacturing and 
services sectors . While the agriculture 
sector contributed modestly to overall 
growth in 2017 , growth of the construction 
sector slowed , largely reflecting the completion of oil transportation projects . 
On the demand side , growth was driven 
by an improvement of net exports , highlighting oil sector expansion and the recovery of global oil prices . 
The current account deficit narrowed 
substantially in 2017 , to 3 percent of 
GDP ( from 6 . 5 percent in 2016 )  , buoyed 
by more favorable terms of trade . The 
improvement in the current account balance helped the tenge to strengthen by 
about 10 percent in real terms against 
the U . S . dollar in 2017 . On the financing 
side , FDI inflows and foreign borrowing 
by state-owned enterprises were offset 
by short-term capital outflows . The central bank reported an increase of assets 
held by residents abroad . As a result , 
gross international reserves of the central bank and the government ( in the oil 
fund ) declined by nearly US$5 billion ( 3 
percent of GDP )  . 
The government continued to consolidate 
its core fiscal accounts , but the overall fiscal 
deficit widened to 7 percent of GDP in 2017 
as a result of the banking sector bailout . 
The government recapitalized the Problem 
Loans Fund with an injection of US$6 . 5 
billion ( about 4 percent of GDP ) in 2017 to 
support the recovery of banks ’ balance 
sheets ; the central bank provided another 
US$2 billion to support ailing banks . 
The central bank continued to implement 
its inflation targeting policy . As the impact of the 2015 currency depreciation 
eased , consumer price inflation halved 
from an average of 14 . 6 percent in 2016 to 
7 . 4 percent in 2017 . With inflation easing , 
the central bank cut its policy interest rate 
three times in 2017 and two times in early 
2018 . The latest rate cut , in March 2018 , 
lowered the policy rate to 9 . 5 percent . 
The poverty rate ( using the $5 . 5 / day international poverty line ) rose from 5 . 6 percent in 2013 to a peak of 7 . 9 percent in 
2016 ; it is estimated to have fallen to 6 . 9 
percent in 2017 . The incidence of poverty 
increased in all regions of Kazakhstan 
between 2014 and 2015 , the last year for 
which data are available . Poverty rates in 
the most vulnerable southern regions 
more than doubled during this period , 
jumping from 5 . 2 percent to 13 . 9 percent 
in Kyzylorda oblast and from 5 percent to 
12 . 5 percent in Jambyl oblast . 
Despite the economic recovery and improved consumer confidence , household 
income remained under pressure in 2017 , 
as the labor market struggled to recover . 
Real wages and salaries declined by 2 . 1

More favorable terms of trade and increased oil production supported the economic recovery and an improvement in 
poverty indicators in Kazakhstan in 2017 . 
Over the medium term , the real GDP 
growth rate is expected to hover around 
3 percent , as the oil sector ’ s contribution 
to economic growth declines relative to 
2017 ( when a structural shift in oil output occurred )  . Risks to the outlook include a potential weakening of the external environment , a worsening of problems 
in the banking sector , and a missed opportunity to deepen structural reforms .

percent year on year . Although wages 
rose by 2 . 5 percent year on year in Astana , the capital—and by 1 . 6 percent and 
1 . 9 percent in Pavlodar and Kostanay 
oblasts , respectively—these gains were 
more than offset by falling real wages in 
the rest of the country . The official unemployment rate remained unchanged in 
2017 at 4 . 9 percent . 
Outlook
As oil output growth stabilizes from 2018 
onward , real GDP growth is expected to 
moderate to an average annual rate of 3 
percent through 2020 . Growth in the nontradable services sector will be supported 
by stronger domestic demand as real incomes of households are expected to start 
recovering . Moreover , the planned additional investment in oil output expansion 
projects will drive an increase in construction activity . 
Assuming that there are no external 
shocks and that the authorities continue 
their inflation targeting regime , consumer 
price inflation will stabilize at between 4 . 3
-5 . 3 percent in the medium term . 
As oil prices are projected to stabilize 
around US$60 per barrel in 2018-20 , the 
current account balance and fiscal oil revenue are also expected to level off . The fiscal position will improve gradually in the 
wake of fiscal consolidation efforts . The 
government is planning to cut the non-oil 
fiscal deficit from over 13 percent of GDP 
in 2017 to 7 percent by 2020 . 
As the economy continues to grow , labor 
income—the primary driver of poverty 
reduction in Kazakhstan—is forecast to 
return to positive real growth . As a result , 
the poverty rate is projected to decline to 5 
percent by 2020 . 
The successful implementation of structural reforms will be required to deliver 
more sustainable and inclusive economic 
growth . The ongoing structural and institutional reforms ( including those under 
the 100 Concrete Steps program and the 
Strategic Plan for Development of Kazakhstan to 2025 , as adopted in early 2018 ) 
should aim to reduce the role of the state 
in the economy and facilitate the development of a vibrant , modern and innovative 
tradable non-oil sector . In this context , 
efforts to restructure and privatize stateowned enterprises would be expected to 
focus on improving the efficiency of public administration , reducing fiscal risks , 
and open contestable spaces for the private sector to act . Prudent fiscal and monetary policies would support economic
and price stability and encourage investment in the non-oil economy . Higher incomes will also have positive spillover 
effects on poverty reduction .  
. 
Risks and challenges
Both external and domestic factors present 
risks to Kazakhstan ’ s medium-term economic outlook . The economy ’ s vulnerability to external shocks remains the main 
challenge to achieving stable and sustainable development . External demand from 
China and the Russian Federation , Kazakhstan ’ s main trading partners , as well 
as global oil demand and prices will remain the key external factors impacting 
Kazakhstan ’ s economic performance . Domestic factors include the pace of implementation of structural and institutional 
reforms , especially in anticipation of a 
political transition over the medium term . 
A potential escalation of problems in the 
banking sector is also a concern . To mitigate these risks and facilitate a sizeable 
expansion of the tradable non-oil sector ’ s 
role in the economy , the government must 
demonstrate significant improvements to 
the rule of law , the investment climate , 
and the quality of human capital .

Recent developments
Growth reached 4 . 4 percent in 2017 , up 
from 4 . 1 percent in 2016 . The upturn is 
driven by rise in investment , and recovery in 
exports . Higher private investment was driven by FDI inflows , thanks to higher growth 
in Europe , low interest rates , and a better 
business environment as Kosovo improved 
its rank from 60 to 40 in Doing Business . 
Investment contributed 3pp to economic 
growth , with public investment increasing 
by 5 percent y-o-y . The recovery in goods 
exports was led by a rebound in commodity 
prices with a broad-based increase in volumes of goods exports , albeit from a low 
base , and a surge in the export of services . 
Net exports contributed a 1 . 1pp while the 
contribution of consumption was only 0 . 4pp . 
In terms of economic sectors , construction , 
trade , financial and transport were the main 
engine of growth in 2017 with a contribution 
of 2 . 6 pp . Agriculture remained stagnant , 
whereas industry contributed 0 . 7pp . 
Consumer price inflation was 1 . 5 percent 
in 2017 y-o-y , up from 0 . 3 percent in 2016 , 
as prices for fuel , food , tobacco , alcohol , 
and other household items increased adding to the cost of living . 
Higher revenues ( up 5 . 3 percent y-o-y ) 
and under-execution of public investments narrowed the fiscal deficit to 1 . 4 
percent of GDP in 2017 , lower than the 
earlier projected 2 percent of GDP . Indirect tax revenues grew by 6 . 1 percent 
( VAT by 8 . 1 percent )  , while non-tax revenues grew by 5 . 6 percent y-o-y . Direct tax 
revenues added only 2 . 5 percent growth , 
due to a decline in CIT collections by 7 
percent . Spending increased by 5 . 7 percent , due to a 11 . 9 percent increase in social transfers and 5 . 4 percent increase in 
capital spending . Higher actual costs than 
planned costs for spending on veterans 
benefits exceeded plans due to the delay 
in the implementation of the cap on the 
scheme . In addition , goods and services 
spending rose by 10 . 7 percent due to early 
elections and creation of two additional 
ministries . Public and publicly guaranteed 
debt remains on a rising trajectory , reaching 15 . 8 percent of GDP at end-2017 . 
The current account deficit ( CAD ) improved 
to 5 . 1 percent of GDP in 2017 , from 8 . 2 percent in 2016 , thanks to better external conditions and increase in export volumes . Exports of goods jumped up by 23 . 1 percent y-o
-y in 2017 due to higher growth of the trading partners , and higher global prices of base 
metals . Exports of services grew by 17 . 7 percent in 2017 , mainly due to higher travel 
expenditures by the diaspora . 
Higher growth continued to foster job creation in 2017 . Employment grew by 1 . 2pp y-oy in the third quarter of 2017 , however , as 
labor force participation expanded further , 
unemployment increased by 2 . 7 pp . Despite 
the recent improvements , employment is still 
low at 29 . 7 percent on average as a share of 
total population . The share of self-employed 
and unpaid family workers , i . e . those in vulnerable employment and measures job quality , remains high at 23 percent ; the youth 
unemployment rate slightly increased reaching 53 . 3 percent in Q3 2017 . The duration of 
unemployment is worrying with over 70 
percent of the unemployed seeking a job for 
over a year .

The economy grew at 4 . 4 percent in

and a recovery in exports . Stronger 
growth fostered job creation in 2017 , 
supporting poverty reduction ; but labor 
force participation remains low . The 
outlook is positive , with 4 . 8 percent 
annual growth projected between 2018-

the ability to execute the public investment program , metal price dynamics 
and the fragile political situation .

growth in Europe and other trading partners pose risks to the outlook . 
Perceived fragility of the government , 
with only 61 out of 120 votes in the parliament , can slow down the implementation 
of public projects through the investment 
clause . In addition , the delay in fiscal reforms such as the implementation of the 
cap on the war veteran ’ s benefits , further 
increases in untargeted categorical social 
benefits , and unfunded early retirement 
schemes increase fiscal pressures . 
Reform priorities should include shifting 
sources of growth towards tradable sectors and increasing productivity to address high unemployment , low participation rates , and poverty . 
Outlook
Economic growth is projected at 4 . 8 percent in 2018-2020 , propelled by higher 
capital spending . Growth in public investment is expected to be driven by several 
projects under preparation , including the 
railway project and regional roads financed by IFIs . Private investment is expected to increase reflecting improvements in the business environment , and 
increase in credit due to the partial credit 
guarantee fund for SMEs established in 
2017 . Higher wages and social spending , 
growth in remittances and credit to households are expected to promote household 
consumption adding an additional 2 . 3 pp 
to growth . Exports are likely to benefit 
from robust growth in Europe and higher 
base metal prices . However , net exports 
are projected to subtract 0 . 9 pp from 
growth in 2018 because of higher imports 
linked to public investment projects . 
The CAD is expected to reach 6 percent of 
GDP in 2018 . Increased demand for investment goods is expected to widen the 
CAD in 2018 , despite higher exports projected . Net FDI and remittances , are expected to finance larger shares of the CAD 
as growth in Europe firms up and larger 
implementation of the Stabilization and 
Association Agreement . 
Poverty , measured at the lower middleincome poverty line ( US$ 3 . 2 / day , 2011 
PPP )  , is expected to decline slightly to 2 . 55 
in 2018 , from 2 . 6 percent in 2017 driven by 
stronger growth . High unemployment 
and inactivity rates remain the key impediments to sustainable poverty reduction . 
Risks and challenges
Kosovo ’ s outlook is positive , but the risks 
are tilted to the downside . Lower than 
projected absorption of public investment , 
lower base metal prices and slower

Recent developments
The Kyrgyz economy has recovered from 
the external shocks of 2014-15 as growth 
accelerated to 4 . 5% in 2017 , from 3 . 8% a 
year earlier . Growth was driven by the 
non-gold industry ( 22% ) while it decelerated in other main sectors : gold , construction , agriculture and services . On the demand side , growth was supported by 
public investment , net exports and private 
consumption fueled by a steady rebound 
in remittances inflows . 
An expansionary fiscal stance was maintained , even as external tailwinds strengthened . The estimated overall fiscal deficit 
was 5% of GDP in 2017 , down from 6 . 6% 
in 2016 and lower than the budgeted deficit of 7 . 5% , but still above the levels of previous years . Both tax and non-tax revenues 
increased as a share of GDP . In addition , 
the budget received rising grant support 
from international donors . At the same 
time , expenditures increased , driven largely by capital outlays . Substantial overruns 
in current spending in the first part of the 
year were partially mitigated by expenditure restraint in the last quarter of 2017 . 
The deficit was mainly financed by foreign 
borrowing , which increased total public 
debt to 63 . 2% of GDP from 61 . 4% in 2016 . 
The current account deficit is estimated to 
have narrowed to 9 . 4% of GDP in 2017 
from 12 . 1% a year before , as exports 
picked-up (  + 14 . 5% in US dollar terms ) and 
remittances continued to grow ( by 24 . 2% 
in US dollar terms )  . The export performance was driven mainly by non-gold 
exports , which benefited from the recovery in regional demand as well as improved compliance by Kyrgyz producers 
with Eurasian Economic Union ( EEU ) 
quality standards . Imports are estimated 
to have risen by 12% ( in US dollar terms )  , 
a slower increase than might have been 
envisaged given the improvement in remittances and high levels of public investment . The current account deficit was financed by FDI and government borrowing . International reserves increased 
slightly to US$2 . 1 billion , covering about 4 
months of imports . 
The stronger balance of payments ( and 
corresponding foreign exchange liquidity 
in the economy ) led to a further appreciation of the Kyrgyz som by 0 . 6% in 2017 
( 8 . 8% in 2016 )  . In real effective terms , 
however , the som depreciated by 0 . 5% , 
largely reflecting relative inflation dynamics with key trading partners . 
Inflation rose slightly in 2017 reaching 
3 . 7% , given buoyant domestic demand . 
With inflation still below the National 
Bank ( NBKR ) target of 5-7% , monetary 
policy remained accommodative . Economic activity was supported by a recovery in 
credit to the economy ( 14% growth )  , following a decline early in the year . 
The poverty rate ( measured at below 
US$3 . 2 per day , 2011 PPP terms ) is estimated to have fallen to 19% in 2016 . Low 
consumer price growth and higher remittance inflows supported household 
consumption . At the same time , moderate 
growth in services and agriculture , where 
about 50% of the bottom 40 are employed , 
constrained real labor income growth for 
the poor .

In 2017 , growth was stronger than expected , supported by external tailwinds , 
the expansionary macroeconomic policy 
stance , which buoyed domestic demand , 
and a better-than-expected ( albeit weakening ) performance in the gold sector . 
Going forward , growth is projected to 
decline slightly in 2018 , before pickingup to 5% over the medium term , allowing for continued moderate declines in 
the poverty rate .

Outlook
Real GDP growth is projected to decelerate slightly to 4 . 2% in 2018 -as industrial 
output growth moderates- and then pick 
up to reach 5% by 2020 . This scenario assumes that recovery takes hold in Russia 
and Kazakhstan , benefiting the Kyrgyz 
economy via the traditional remittance 
and trade channels . An additional boost is 
expected to come from exports , thanks to 
a number of developments , which include :  ( i ) enhanced access to the EEU market ; and ( ii ) improved bilateral relations 
with Uzbekistan , which should lead to 
higher trade between the two countries . 
These effects should mitigate the anticipated moderation of public expenditure . 
Inflation is envisaged to remain in line 
with the NBKR target , assuming no significant global food price increases and 
relative exchange rate stability . 
While remittance inflows are expected to 
grow further , the current account deficit 
is projected to remain elevated at around 
10% of GDP , reflecting structural features of the economy and continued 
high , albeit gradually moderating , levels 
of public investment . 
The fiscal deficit is projected to decline to 
2 . 9% of GDP by 2020 . This will be achieved 
through measures to increase tax revenues 
and curtail current spending , while capital 
expenditures would remain robust at about 
7 . 6% of GDP on average ( although falling to 
6 . 1% in 2020 as externally financed projects 
decline )  . Over 2018-20 , tax revenues should 
increase as a share of GDP , with measures 
to :  ( i ) expand the tax base by encouraging 
businesses to formalize ,  ( ii ) improve the 
administration of taxes ,  ( iii ) reduce tax exemptions , and ( iv ) increase some tax rates . 
Over the same period , expenses are targeted to decline by over 5 percentage points 
( from 38 . 7% in 2018 ) as a result of efforts to 
( i ) streamline non-priority purchases of 
goods and services ,  ( ii ) reduce the wage bill 
as a share of GDP , and ( iii ) strengthen public procurement . 
Modest increases in growth in agriculture 
and construction , and a solid performance of 
remittances , are likely to support rural poverty reduction . Social transfers will continue 
to play an important role in driving poverty 
reduction in both urban and rural areas . A 
scheduled increase in pensions should also 
benefit poor households given that pensions 
represent close to 15% of income among the 
poor . The poverty rate is projected to decline 
to 18 . 5% in 2018 and 16 . 7% in 2020 . 
Risks and challenges
The outlook is subject to downside risks . 
Growth will continue to be highly dependent on exogenous regional developments . Specifically , a slowdown in Russia 
and Kazakhstan could affect negatively 
the baseline scenario via remittances and 
trade . Adverse exchange rate developments could heighten competition in the 
domestic and EEU markets . 
A core challenge continues to be to accelerate the process of convergence of local 
production to EEU standards . This would 
help Kyrgyz producers to boost exports of 
agricultural and textile products in the 
short and medium run . 
Another challenge will be to bring fiscal policy back to a sustainable path , 
while continuing to provide adequate 
support to the economy . Several policy 
decisions taken in the run-up to the 
Presidential elections in October 2017 
are expected to add structural pressure 
on spending , including a universal extension of the previously incometargeted benefit for low income families 
with children , which will complicate 
the task of fiscal consolidation .

Recent developments
The political turmoil of 2015-2017 slowed 
real GDP growth in 2017 from 2 . 9 percent 
in 2016 to zero percent in 2017 , driven by a 
fall in investments . The inauguration of 
the new government in June 2017 resolved 
the stalemate as evidenced by the companies ’ improved expectations on future 
production . Investment fell by 4 . 5 percent 
y-o-y in 2017 , but it started recovering by 
year-end with recovering investor confidence . Private consumption was the only 
contributor to growth in 2017 , supported 
by higher employment and wages . Netexports contributed negatively to growth 
( -0 . 7 pp )  . Solid exports growth was propelled by the recovery in the Euro area but 
was not enough to compensate for rising 
imports for energy , FDI-related imports , 
and iron and steel . At the sector level , 
construction and manufacturing stalled in 
2017 , with construction falling by almost 
14 percent y-o-y in real terms as both private and public construction activities 
stalled . Mining , wholesale and retail trade 
and agriculture were the only sectors that 
contributed positively to growth , supported by rising metal prices , growth in disposable income and a favorable harvest 
season , respectively . 
Inflation remained low in 2017 at 1 . 4 percent , although it increased from a 2016 deflation , driven by rising prices of food and 
beverages , energy ( including oil )  , clothing 
and footwear and communications . 
Despite slower growth , there were improvements in the labor market . Employment
grew by 2 . 4 percent y-o-y in 2017 , helped 
in part by employment subsidies in the 
first part of the year , through which almost third of the net new jobs were created . The employment rate has been constantly improving , but remains low at 44 
percent , meaning that more than half of 
the working age population is either unemployed or outside of the labor force . 
Most of the jobs created were in wholesale 
and retail trade , accommodation and food 
services and manufacturing—the latter 
sectors with links to the FDI-economy , 
which benefit from tax exemptions and 
other government support . As a result , the 
unemployment rate fell to a historical low , 
at 22 . 4 percent in 2017 , close to 80 percent 
of which is long-term . 
Poverty is estimated to have continued 
declining in 2017 . Poverty ( at US$5 . 5 / day 
at 2011 PPP ) is projected to have fallen to 
21 percent in 2017 , continuing a decreasing trend present since 2009 . Employment 
growth and increases in salaries , especially in the labor-intensive sectors , are expected to have driven most of the poverty 
reduction in 2017 . Pensions , which played 
a role in the 2009-2014 decrease , are unlikely to have played a relevant role in 
recent poverty dynamics . 
Revenue gains in 2017 were offset by increases in spending , resulting in unchanged fiscal deficit—at 2 . 7 percent of 
GDP . Revenues increased on the back of 
solid VAT and collection of the social security contributions , while expenditures 
increased due to higher spending for 
health , pensions , and subsidies . Capital 
spending once again remained underexecuted reflecting a slowdown in project

As investment contracted after a prolonged political crisis , economic growth 
slowed to zero percent in 2017 . Growth is 
projected to rise to 2 . 3 percent in 2018 , 
driven by consumption and recovering 
investment . Despite the slowdown , labor 
market improved thanks to public subsidies ; but employment and labor force 
participation rates remain low compared 
to the EU . The fiscal deficit remained 
unchanged in 2017 , with higher spending offsetting improved tax collection . 
Poverty continued to decline in 2017 , 
propelled by job creation .

implementation . Public and publicly guaranteed debt declined to 47 . 5 percent in 
2017 , from 48 . 4 percent in 2016 , but due to 
a drawdown on accumulated deposits to 
reduce new borrowing . 
Credit growth increased in 2017 . Household credit grew by 9 . 2 percent , while 
corporate lending remained subdued 
throughout 2017 ( 2 . 6 percent )  . The loan-to
-deposit ratio stood at 88 percent , which 
should allow banks to expand lending 
activities . Non-performing loans ( NPLs ) 
stood at 6 . 3 percent , similar to 6 . 4 percent 
at end-2016 , but corporate NPLs increased 
slightly to 9 . 9 percent . 
The current account deficit narrowed to 
1 . 1 percent of GDP in 2017 . Solid export 
performance of FDIs , iron and steel , furniture and tobacco helped to reduce the 
goods and services deficit to 13 . 9 percent 
of GDP ( from 15 percent in 2016 )  . Net 
private transfer inflows increased slightly 
to 15 . 8 percent of GDP , while primary 
income deficit widened further to 4 . 2 percent of GDP as foreign investors kept repatriating profits amidst the political turmoil . Foreign direct investments declined 
in 2017 to only 2 . 3 percent of GDP , compared to 3 . 2 percent in 2016 . At end-2017 , 
foreign reserves stood at 4 . 4 months of 
imports and were further replenished in 
January 2018 as the Government issued a 
7-year EUR 500 million Eurobond at 2 . 75 
percent which fully covers government 
borrowing requirements for 2018 . 

Outlook
The economic outlook is positive , with 
growth expected to average 2 . 7 percent 
during 2018-2020 . Construction activity is 
expected to recover , as the construction of 
two highways is resumed . The manufacturing sector is also expected to recover , a 
process that began in late 2017 , propelled 
by improved foreign demand from the 
EU . Private consumption is projected to 
rise supported by higher employment and 
as the new authorities indicated rise in 
social transfers . 
Poverty is likely to continue its downward trend in 2018-2020 with improved 
economic outlook . Public investment in 
infrastructure should sustain employment creation . Increases in social transfers 
should also translate into further poverty 
reductions , if properly designed and 
means-tested . 
Fiscal deficit is planned to remain unchanged in 2018 leading to rise in public 
debt to 50 percent of GDP . 
Risks and challenges
With the political crisis now resolved , the 
main risk comes from fiscal vulnerabilities 
and low potential growth . A low revenue 
to GDP ratio , a growing deficit in the pension system , higher interest payments , 
and accumulated arrears are risks to fiscal 
sustainability . Discussions about raising 
untargeted social transfers compound the 
sustainability concerns . 
Credible fiscal consolidation program 
focused on strengthening efficiency of 
public spending and broadening of the tax 
base would help to stabilize public debt , 
rebuild fiscal buffers against future shocks 
and increase investor confidence . 
Ensuring the backward linkages of the 
FDIs , unlocking potentials in the energy , 
tourism and agriculture sectors , as well 
as reducing the overregulation in professional and infrastructure network 
services could help increasing the potential growth .

Recent developments
Growth reached 4 . 5 percent in 2017 on account of strong consumption led by the 
ongoing recovery in remittances and increases in real wages . A double-digit increase in public investments stimulated 
gross fixed capital formation (  + 5 . 1 percent )  . 
Despite robust exports supported by the 
good harvest of the past two years , imports 
increased rapidly resulting in a negative 
contribution of net exports to growth ( -2 . 7 
percentage points )  . On the production side , 
growth has been mainly driven by the retail and wholesale trade (  + 1 . 3 percentage 
points )  , followed by growth in agriculture 
(  + 1 percentage points ) and industry (  + 0 . 4 
percentage points )  . 
After a sharp deceleration in 2016 , the inflation rate averaged 6 . 6 percent in 2017 , 
just above the target corridor of 5 percent 
+  / - 1 . 5 percent . Increases in regulated prices , unfavorable climatic conditions in 
Spring which affected seasonal agricultural outputs , and stronger internal demand 
accelerated the inflation rate , which has 
been out of the target corridor since April 
2017 . To stimulate credit activity and absorb the existing liquidity after the banking crisis , throughout 2017 , the NBM gradually reduced the base interest rate ( from 9 
percent to 6 . 5 percent )  , while increasing 
the reserve requirement ratio to a record 
high of 40 percent . Strong foreign inflows 
pushed the appreciation of the Moldovan 
Leu , tempering the cost-push inflation 
pressures . By end-January 2018 , the inflation rate registered 6 . 5 percent y / y . 
The increasing real wages and a recovering flow of remittances , as well as the 
favorable 2016 harvest have been associated with a downward trend in the poverty headcount , which , measured at the 
international moderate poverty threshold of US$ 5 . 5 / day in 2011 PPP , decreased to 16 . 3 percent in 2015 from 18 . 4 
in 2014 , and continued decreasing in 
2016 . The unemployment rate fell form 
4 . 9 percent in 2015 to 4 . 2 percent in 2016 , 
the decline being particularly pronounced in rural areas ( 0 . 9 percentage 
points )  , where the incidence of poverty 
is higher . Salaries increased by a further 
5 . 2 percent in real terms in 2017 , supporting household welfare . 
The external position remains stable , despite a recent increase in current account 
deficit . In the first nine months of 2017 , 
exports increased in nominal terms by 
25 . 2 percent , remittances increased by 12 . 1 
percent , while net direct investments increased 1 . 2 percentage points of GDP 
compared to end-2016 , on account of reinvested profits , reaching 2 . 5 percent of 
GDP . Yet , supported by a stronger Leu 
and imports of electricity , imports increased (  + 22 . 5 percent y / y )  , determining 
the widening of the current account deficit 
by 3 . 4 percentage points y / y reaching 9 . 2 
percent of GDP . The current account deficit continues to be financed predominantly through external debt . As of endSeptember 2017 , total external debt grew 
by 8 . 1 percent totaling 83 percent of GDP . 
Against this background , by end-January 
2018 foreign reserves reached an all-time 
record of 2 . 9 billion USD , covering more 
than 5 months of imports .

Sources : National authorities and World Bank estimates . Sources : World Bank . Notes : see Table 2 . 
In 2017 , Moldova registered robust growth

Higher wages and the recovery of remittances brought poverty rate down . 
Growth momentum is expected to be preserved during 2018 and 2019 supported by

Following two years of tight fiscal policies , a lower than expected deficit was 
registered in 2017 , as fiscal revenues outpaced the double-digit increase in expenditures . Following the under execution in
2016 , public spending increased 12 . 5 percent y / y . Supported by a strong increase in 
fiscal revenues and better compliance , 
public revenues increased 16 . 2 percent y / 
y . Buoyant foreign trade was also reflected 
in strong collections of VAT (  + 15 . 8 percent , y / y ) and excises (  + 30 . 9 percent , y / y )  . 
As a result , the fiscal deficit was 2 . 2 percentage points higher , totaling -0 . 8 percent 
of GDP . 
Outlook
Growth is expected to be robust and reach 
3 . 8% in 2018 and 3 . 7% in 2019 but remain 
below the historical averages ( of 4 . 6% )  . In 
the medium-term the recovery in remittances together with private wage 
growth will sustain private consumption , 
which will remain a key driver of growth . 
Import growth will outpace export 
growth , leading to a negative contribution 
of net trade to GDP growth . With parliamentary elections in November 2018 , after 
a prolonged contraction , the Government 
plans to increase public investments , with 
a focus on the road sector . Still , structural 
weaknesses will contain growth at around 
3 . 5 percent . As consumption and imports 
strengthen , the current account deficit is 
expected to gradually increase , but to remain below its historical average thanks 
to revitalization of foreign inflows . The 
inflation rate is expected to reach the lower bound of the target corridor in 2018 due 
to base effects and lower regulated prices 
and to gradually increasing to the target 
of 5 percent in medium term . In the baseline scenario , fiscal deficits are projected to 
remain under control . Due to mandated 
indexation and valorization of pensions , 
wage increases and additional public capital investments , expenditures will increase 
reaching about 3 percent of GDP in 2018 . 
The factors underlying a favorable growth 
forecast similarly suggest a further decline 
in the poverty headcount during the projection period , following the trend from 
recent years . Increases in real wages and 
remittances , as well as a good harvest year 
should support household welfare , inclusively in rural areas , where the incidence 
of poverty remains higher . The rate of 
wage increases according to latest data 
from Q3 of 2017 suggests that on an annual basis wages in agriculture increased 
faster than in the economy overall . The 
poverty headcount , measured at the international moderate poverty threshold of 
$5 . 5 / day is projected to decline from 16 . 3 
percent in 2015 to 12 . 7 percent in 2018 and 
11 . 7 percent in 2019 . 
Risks and challenges
After two years of good climatic conditions , extreme weather may affect agricultural output with consequences for overall 
growth . The banking sector has stabilized , 
yet it is important to continue reforms and 
strengthen the transparency in the sector . 
Moreover , the increased demand (  + 30 percent in the first half of 2017 ) observed for 
the unregulated and poorly monitored non
-banking financial intermediation sector 
raises concerns . Weaker growth of key 
trade partners and potential changes in 
international trade and migration relations 
could undermine exports and remittance 
flows . While the authorities have made 
efforts to reduce macroeconomic risks , faster growth is necessary to converge with EU 
countries . For this to happen , Moldova 
needs deep transformational reforms that 
will create new and better jobs in the private sector and consequently will create 
space for public investment needs .

Recent developments
The economy grew by 4 . 3 percent in 2017 . 
Investment made the strongest contribution to growth at 5 percentage points ( pp )  , 
as the construction of the Bar-Boljare 
highway and residential construction 
accelerated . Consumption also grew , contributing an additional 3 . 7 percentage 
points , supported by employment and 
wage growth . Net exports continued to 
contribute negatively to growth , but in 
2017 subtracted less from growth due to a 
record tourism season and a pickup in 
goods exports from the metal industry , 
driven by improved EU demand . Due to 
high import content , the growth impact of 
the higher investment for highway construction is subdued . 
Credit growth increased by close to 12 
percent in 2017 , as household lending 
surged , amid subdued corporate lending . 
NPLs declined to 7 percent of total loans , 
supported by relaxed voluntary financial 
restructuring rules . Current account deficit 
further widened to 18 . 9 percent of GDP in 
2017 on the back of rising constructionrelated imports and despite rise in exports 
of metals , mineral ore sales , and tourism . 
Net FDI inflows increased to 11 . 2 percent 
of GDP , financing two-thirds of the CAD . 
Still , after a decline in 2016 to 160 percent , 
external debt increased again in 2017 to an 
estimated 162 percent of GDP and remains 
the highest in the region . 
Robust growth led to employment rise by 
2 . 5 percent in 2017 ; however , it slowed 
down in the last quarter by 0 . 2 percentage 
points--first such decline since late 2013 , 
due to agriculture , mining industry , retail 
and real estate . While the registered unemployment rate increased to above 22 
percent in 2017 , given the large informality ( one out of three jobs )  , the survey-based 
unemployment rate shows a decline by 
over 1 pp , to 16 . 1 percent by September 
2017 ( a four-quarter average )  . Surveybased employment rate grew by one percentage point to 45 . 9 percent along with 
the activity rate , albeit at a slower pace . 
Poverty is estimated to have declined in 
the past few years as economic growth 
picked up and social transfers surged . In 
2017 , however , it was difficult to achieve 
significant poverty reduction given the 
withdrawal of the mothers ’ benefit in the 
second half of the year . Additionally , led 
by public sector wage dynamics , real 
gross wages declined by 0 . 4 percent in 
2017 . Poverty ( measured as consumption 
below the standardized middle-incomecountry poverty line of $5 . 5 / day in 2011 
PPP terms ) declined from 8 . 7 percent in 
2012 to an estimated 4 . 4 percent in 2017 . 
Inflation picked up in 2017 to 2 . 4 percent 
on the back of rise in excises on tobacco , 
alcohol and sugary drinks , and spillovers 
from international oil and food price . Due 
to the increase in the VAT rate from 19 to 
21 percent , and excises on tobacco and 
alcohol , inflation increased by 2 . 6 percent 
yoy in January 2018 . 
Government launched an ambitious fiscal 
consolidation program in 2017 reducing 
the deficit by one percentage point of 
GDP in 2017 compared to a no-reform 
scenario . By December , tax revenues increased by over 9 percent y-o-y led by

Economic growth accelerated in 2017 due 
to surge in investment led by the highway 
construction and a historically strong 
tourism season . Employment increased 
continuing four years of growth . However , unemployment remains high amid 
high informality and increased labor imports . Labor force participation increased 
slightly led by male activation . While 
fiscal consolidation efforts are underway , 
led by tax changes , high deficit and public 
debt require continued efforts . The improved credit rating outlook is providing 
easier access to capital market .

improved collection of VAT and excises . 
Spending increased by close to 12 percent 
on the back of tripled capital budget . On 
the other hand , wage reduction and abolishment of the mothers ’ benefit from the 
second half of 2017 helped decelerate 
growth of the wage bill and social transfers . Consequently , general government 
deficit increased from 3 . 1 percent in 2016 
to an estimated 5 . 2 percent of GDP in 
2017 . Public debt including guarantees 
increased to 74 percent of GDP by end2017 . After the initial fiscal consolidation 
efforts , outlook on the credit rating of B + 
improved to stable . This has allowed easier access to capital market for a regular 
refinancing of liabilities coming due in 
2018 and 2019-2021 . 
Outlook
The economy is expected to grow by an 
average of 2 . 5 percent annually in 2018-20 
on the back of public investments and 
personal consumption . While growth of 
investment will slow down as the highway construction gets to its closure , its 
contribution to growth will remain strong 
in 2018 . Current imbalances are likely to 
stay high given the import dependence of 
the current growth pattern . 
Inflation is projected at 2 . 5 percent in the 
period 2018-19 , as the VAT rate rise adds 
to the current inflation growth in 2018 . 
Fiscal deficit is projected to be brought 
down to 3 . 2 percent in 2018 , and slowly 
reaching surplus by 2020 . 
With the potential poverty impact of fiscal 
consolidation measures , in 2018 poverty is 
expected to slightly increase as mothers ’ 
benefits phase out . Poverty is likely to 
resume its decline in 2019-20 to an estimated 4 . 4 percent by 2020 , subject to improvements in private sector employment 
and earnings . 
Risks and challenges
The positive economic outlook faces high , 
but moderating risks . As the highway 
construction is completed in 2019 , growth 
will slow unless productivity gains and 
new private sector investments realize . 
Large fiscal deficit and growing public 
debt call for the decisive implementation 
of the recently adopted fiscal consolidation program . The fiscal framework that 
aims to have a balanced budget by 2019 , 
from over 5 percent deficit in 2017 , will 
require credible spending consolidation in 
wage bill , social transfers , and operational 
costs to put public deficit and debt on a 
sustainable trajectory . 
External imbalances are still high , adding 
to an already high external vulnerability . 
Enhancing policy predictability and accelerating the pace of structural reforms , 
would be needed for their moderation . 
Reducing unemployment , especially for 
youth and mitigating short-term poverty 
and social impacts of fiscal consolidation 
and facilitating access to employment 
need to be an important part of the policy agenda .

Recent developments
Booming domestic demand boosted real 
GDP growth to 4 . 6 percent in 2017 , from 
2 . 9 percent in 2016 . Powered by an extremely strong labor market and social 
spending ( mainly for the Family 500 + program )  , private consumption grew by 4 . 8 
percent , adding 2 . 8 percentage points to 
GDP growth . 
The biggest positive development in 2017 
was a 5 . 4 percent expansion in gross fixed 
investment . This was a remarkable recovery from a 7 . 9 percent drop in 2016 caused 
by a cyclical fall in EU-funded projects , 
reduced FDI inflow , and elevated political 
risk . The rebound in investment resulted 
from the resumption of EU funding and 
removal of a source of instability in the 
banking sector related to the conversion of 
foreign-currency-denominated mortgages 
to local currency . 
The renewed investment helped to 
boost import demand in the second half 
of the year . Hence , despite heavy demand for Poland ’ s exports from outside 
of the euro zone , net exports contributed just 0 . 1 percentage points to overall 
GDP growth . 
Labor market conditions have tightened 
further . The ratio of vacancies to unemployment has shot past 10 percent ; in 
four years the number of low-skilled unemployed has been cut in half and now 
accounts for just 30 percent of unemployment ; and , for the first time since the 
transition , long-term unemployment 
dipped below 500 , 000 . Employment rates
continued to rise and labor shortages have 
started to affect business activity . 
After two years of persistent deflation , 
consumer prices rose an average of 2 percent in 2017 , mainly because of higher 
global commodity prices , food inflation 
and firmer domestic demand . At 2 . 1 percent year on year in December 2017 , inflation is still below the National Bank of 
Poland ( NBP ) medium-term target of 2 . 5 
percent . Demand-side price pressures are 
modest so far , with core inflation just 0 . 9 
percent year on year in December . Real 
monetary conditions eased considerably 
in 2017 , despite nominal appreciation of 
the zloty . Since March 2015 the NBP Monetary Policy Council has kept its benchmark policy rate unchanged at 1 . 5 percent . 
The zloty continued to be somewhat volatile in 2017 but strengthened overall 
against the euro and the US dollar . 
It is estimated that poverty and shared 
prosperity indicators continued to improve in 2017 in light of surging private 
consumption supported by a tight labor 
market and government social programs . Poverty is expected to have declined from 2 . 7 percent in 2015 to 1 . 3 
percent in 2017 using the $5 . 50 / day 2011 
PPP poverty line . 
More efficient tax collection helped the government to realize its ambitious 2017 spending plans while running the tightest budget 
execution on record . This was possible because more was collected in taxes , mostly 
from indirect taxes ( due to robust private 
consumption and improved tax compliance ) but also from one-off non-tax revenues , such as higher NBP profits . In 2016 
the general government deficit narrowed to 
POLAND
Sources : MFMod , World Bank . Sources : World Bank ( see notes to Table 2 )  . 
Real GDP growth picked up to 4 . 6 percent in 2017 , driven primarily by private 
consumption . A recovery in investment 
in the end of 2017 promises continued 
growth . The main risks to medium term 
growth relate to labor shortages and lower 
allocation of EU funds for Poland . Poverty will continue to decline in line with 
growing disposable incomes . Although 
the general deficit is at a record low , 
structural weakening is possible . Fiscal 
adjustment may constitute a challenge as 
Poland prepares for elections .

a 1 . 6 percent of GDP , a record low , after 
hitting 2 . 5 percent in 2016 . 
Despite the zloty appreciating against the 
euro and heightened domestic demand , 
the strong performance of exports managed in 2017 to lift the current account to a 
surplus of 0 . 1 percent of GDP . 
Outlook
In light of the positive investment results 
in 2017 and improved growth prospects 
in the EU , the previous projection of real 
GDP growth for Poland has been revised 
upward by 0 . 2 percentage points : again , 
driven by both private consumption and 
investment ; economic growth may reach 
4 . 2 percent in 2018 and 3 . 7 percent in 
2019 . Household spending will benefit 
from growth in the real wage bill of 
more than 8 percent in 2018-19 , plus 
higher state spending on pensions and 
social benefits . Rising real incomes are 
expected to lead to further declines in 
poverty . The $5 . 50 / day 2011 PPP poverty rate is projected to decline to 1 . 2 
percent in 2018 and further to 1 . 0 percent 
by 2020 . 
Public spending is likely to be strong , 
supported by EU funds and the political 
cycle leading up to the elections . High 
corporate profitability and EU funds 
should support private investment . Exports and industrial production are likely to benefit from stronger European 
demand in 2018-19 , but imports may 
outpace both . 
The general government deficit is set to 
widen again in 2018 to about 2 percent of 
GDP—but still safely below the 3 percent EU threshold . Spending is expected 
to rise due to higher government consumption , local pre-elections investment , 
and the decision to roll back the planned 
increases of the retirement age . The revenue side will also contribute to the increasing budget gap : non-tax revenues 
could be lower this year due to less NBP 
profit , and the change in retirement age 
will depress social contributions from 
the cohort eligible for earlier retirement . 
Public debt will stabilize around 51 percent of GDP in 2018-19 , but the structural budget deficit will widen . 
The current-account is likely to come 
back to a small deficit in 2018 as robust 
household consumption , higher investment , and a firming in global commodity 
markets push up the volume and cost of 
imports . Nonetheless , the currentaccount deficit will remain modest in 
2018-20 at less than 0 . 5 percent of GDP . 
Risks and challenges
There are three main clouds on Poland ’ s 
economic horizon :  ( i ) Structural weakening in public finance ;  ( ii ) a shortage of labor ; and ( iii ) EU sanctions against Poland 
for not respecting EU democratic values . 
First , the government ' s spending plans , 
with increases in social benefits and public 
investment , and the reduction in the statutory retirement age , could erode the structure of public finances . Strengthening the 
fiscal position might be difficult given local , presidential , and parliamentary elections all coming up within 18 months . Second , the shortage of labor may soon weigh 
heavily on GDP growth , and would be 
exacerbated by retirement of a greater part 
of the workforce . Too few workers could 
negatively affect production capacities and 
investment . This would heighten pressure 
on the government to encourage immigration , which could come primarily from 
Ukraine . Third , the government ' s failure to 
address rule of law issues and a vote by 
the European Parliament in late 2017 to 
initiate Article 7 proceedings against Poland may lead the EU to impose sanctions , 
possibly lowering the EU fund allocation 
for 2021–27 .

Recent developments
Private consumption (  + 8 . 8 percent ) was 
the main driver of growth in 2017 , fueled 
by tax cuts ; hikes in minimum and publicsector wages ; and increases in pensions 
that boosted disposable incomes . With a 
5 . 4 percent increase , investment also 
showed signs of recovery . Exports grew 
strongly (  + 9 . 5 percent )  , but were outpaced 
by imports (  + 11 . 1 percent )  . On the production side , ICT (  + 10 . 9 percent ) and industry 
(  + 8 percent ) were the main drivers of 
growth , with agriculture (  + 18 . 3 percent ) 
performing better than expected , facilitated by good weather conditions . 
Fiscal policy was pro-cyclical in 2017 . Increases in public wages and pensions led 
to a 22 percent hike in the compensation 
of employees and a 15 . 5 percent increase 
in current spending , outpacing fiscal revenue growth (  + 12 . 5 percent )  . The deficit , 
however , remained below 3 percent of 
GDP because of the decline in public investment ( -9 . 5 percent )  , including low 
utilization of the EU funds . 
The expansionary fiscal policy led to an 
overheating of the economy , contributing 
also to inflation to 4 . 7 percent in February 
2018 – above the upper limit of the National Bank of Romania ( NBR ) band . In 
response , the NBR board increased the 
policy rate by 25 ppts ( to 2 . 25 percent ) in 
two consecutive meetings in early 2018 . 
This came amid robust private sector credit growth ( up 5 . 6 percent as of December 
2017 ) and concerns over the fiscal stance . 
The current account deficit deteriorated to 
3 . 4 percent of GDP at end-2017 reflecting 
the strong imports growth . 
The labor market benefited from the economic growth , with unemployment falling to 4 . 6 percent as of December 2017 – a 
25-year low – and real wages increasing 
by 8 . 1 percent . Nonetheless , the low employment rate of 65 . 3 in Q3 2017 , down 0 . 2 
percentage points from the previous quarter , reflects persistent structural rigidities 
in the labor market . 
In line with economic growth , a boost in 
private consumption and labor market 
improvements , the poverty rate corresponding to upper middle-income countries ( using the $5 . 50 / day 2011 PPP poverty line ) is estimated to have declined 
from 26 . 1 percent in 2015 to 23 . 6 percent 
in 2017 , continuing its downward path 
since the peak of the crisis in 2011 ( 31 . 7 
percent )  . High poverty incidence continues to be associated with reliance on agriculture and in rural / marginalized areas . 
Employment gains in sectors that employ 
a large share of low-skilled people have 
helped improve the incomes of the bottom 
40 and prevented a further increase in the 
Gini index in 2015 . 
Outlook
The economy is projected to continue to 
grow above potential in 2018 . GDP will 
likely expand by around 5 . 1 percent in 
2018 , driven by the fiscal stimulus and 
aided by a resurgent EU . Continued 
growth in consumption is expected to 
widen the current account deficit to 4 . 3

Private consumption propelled growth to 7 
percent in 2017 . Growth was supported by 
an expansionary fiscal policy , that coincided with an increase in exports to a resurgent EU . Improvements in the labor market contributed to poverty reduction . 
Growth will remain solid in 2018 , but 
medium-term risks to the outlook have 
increased . Pressures on the budget deficit , 
arising from an increase in recurrent 
spending , will continue in 2018 . To improve the quality of growth , renewed attention should be given to public investment .

percent in 2018 . Inflation is set to peak at 
around 5 percent in mid-2018 reflecting 
the excess domestic demand and the fading out of the base effect of the tax cuts . 
The NBR anticipates a gradual subsequent 
decline in inflation towards 3 . 5 percent at 
the end of 2018 , due to a slowdown in 
private consumption dynamics as no further fiscal boost to households ’ real disposable income is envisioned . 
The fiscal measures passed in 2017 have 
put pressure on the consolidated budget 
deficit . In the absence of corrective 
measures , the fiscal deficit is projected to 
reach 3 . 3 percent of GDP in 2018 , which 
would place Romania on a trajectory to reentering the Excessive Deficit Procedure 
of the EU . However , the government has 
stated that , like in 2017 , it would be ready 
to promote adjustment measures should 
the deficit threaten the 3 percent ceiling . 
The widening of the fiscal deficit would 
push public debt to 46 . 8 percent of GDP at 
end-2020 , from 44 . 5 percent in 2017 . Despite this , public debt remains one of the 
lowest in the EU . 
Strong private consumption aided by the 
expansionary fiscal policy and continued 
growth in real wages , partly supported by 
minimum wage increases , should boost 
real incomes and lead to further declines 
in poverty incidence . Moreover , the 
planned introduction of the Minimum 
Social Inclusion Income program ( MSII ) is 
expected to improve targeting and increase the level of benefits for the most 
vulnerable . The $5 . 50 / day 2011 PPP poverty rate is projected to decline to 22 . 6 
percent in 2018 , 21 . 7 percent in 2019 , and 
20 . 9 percent in 2020 . 
Risks and challenges
Accumulating fiscal pressures and excess 
domestic demand limit the space for policy-makers to maneuver in 2018 and beyond . The current account deficit is on the 
rise , and inflationary pressures persist . 
These developments leave the Romanian 
economy vulnerable to exogenous shocks . 
The authorities may need to take corrective measures to keep the deficit below 3 
percent of GDP in 2018 through good 
quality fiscal adjustment . Externally , a 
likely tapering of the quantitative easing 
in the Eurozone and higher global interest 
rates may lead to a repositioning in investor sentiment towards the emerging economies and to higher refinancing costs , 
further reinforcing fiscal pressures . On the 
upside , a better-than-projected economic 
performance of the Eurozone will act as a 
driver of growth in the broader EU area , 
including Romania . 
Renewed efforts are needed to improve 
labor participation and generate broadbased employment , as unemployment 
remains high among youth and the lowskilled , and to ensure that all Romanians 
obtain access to high quality public services . Gradually , the focus of the fiscal 
policy should be rebalanced away from 
boosting consumption towards mobilizing investment , including from the EU 
funds , to support a sustainable EU convergence path and social inclusion . Reforms in public administration and 
SOEs , increased regulatory predictability , as well as policies to address the 
large social and spatial discrepancies 
should be on the agenda of priorities of 
the government .

Recent developments
In 2017 , Russia ’ s economy emerged from 
recession to recovery , with the GDP expanding by 1 . 5 percent year-on-year . 
Deepening macro-economic stability , 
firming energy prices and a recovering 
global economy contributed to the return 
to growth . Non-tradable sectors , primarily transportation , retail and wholesale 
trade , contributed 1 . 4 percentage points 
( pp ) of the 1 . 5 percent total . Mineralresource extraction increased by 1 . 4 percent , year-on-year , as oil production 
flattened after Russia joined the OPEC + 
agreement . Growth in manufacturing was 
subdued , partly due to lower public 
spending on defense . 
Domestic demand was the main engine of 
growth . Both household and investment 
demand expanded . Private consumption , 
supported by growing real wages and 
pensions and by a revival of credit to 
households , contributed 1 . 8 pp to growth . 
Fixed-capital investment in mineral resource extraction , transportation , and in 
the financial sector , mainly supported 
investment growth . However , growth in 
manufacturing was not followed by fixed 
capital investment growth . While robust 
external demand supported the country ’ s 
exports , a major increase in imports resulted in a negative contribution of net exports to GDP growth . 
The Central Bank of Russia ( CBR ) continued to clean up the banking sector : 16 
banks had their licenses revoked due to 
non-compliance with regulations , and 
another systemically important private 
bank ( Promsvyazbank , 1 . 6 percent share 
by assets ) was bailed out by CBR . That 
made it the third bank to be rescued under a new resolution mechanism . As a 
result , the share of state-controlled banks 
in the combined assets of the Russian 
banking system has increased to 66 . 2 percent , most of them under CBR ownership 
( 45 percent of assets )  . This may affect the 
level playing-field and pose a conflict of 
interest between the CBR ’ s regulatory and 
ownership functions . 
In 2017 , credit grew both in retail and corporate segments ( 13 . 3 percent and 3 . 8 percent , year-on-year , respectively )  . The 
share of non-performing loans remained 
stable—but high—at 10 percent as of January 1 , 2018 , and the overall banking sector 
capital adequacy ratio was also stable at 
12 . 1 percent . However , compared to other 
emerging markets , both figures point to 
underlying vulnerabilities in Russia . As of 
January 1 , 2018 , profitability in the banking sector declined to 2016 levels , with the 
return on assets and equity at 1 percent 
and 8 . 3 percent , respectively . 
The CBR continued its gradual approach 
to monetary easing aimed at anchoring 
inflation expectations . A combination of a 
stronger ruble and a bumper harvest , and 
relatively tight monetary and fiscal policy , 
helped reach record-low inflation levels . 
In 2017 , consumer inflation reached 3 . 7 
percent ( year-on-year , 12-month average )  , 
down from 7 . 1 percent in 2016 . 
In 2017 , the current account surplus 
reached US$40 . 2 billion , strengthened by 
an improved trade balance , and was mirrored by higher net capital outflows ,

many individuals lack formal jobs . Priority policy objectives include limiting the 
role of the state in the economy , increasing 
investment , and promoting fair competition , as well as measures to improve investments in human capital .

mainly from the banking sector , which 
continued its external-debt repayments . 
International reserves increased by 
US$15 . 4 billion mainly on the back of currency purchases conducted by the CBR on 
behalf of Ministry of Finance . 
The general government fiscal stance improved in 2017 , aided by higher oil prices , 
a recovering economy , an improved tax 
administration , and lower expenditures . 
The general government primary budget 
deficit narrowed from 2 . 8 percent of GDP 
in 2016 to 0 . 6 percent of GDP in 2017 . Russia ’ s new fiscal rule , expected to reduce 
the influence of external volatility on the 
budget and the real exchange rate , comes 
into effect in 2019 and will require fiscal 
consolidation in 2018-20 . Combined with 
the move towards inflation-targeting , it 
underscores the Russian authorities ’ commitment to enhance macro-stability . 
Unemployment declined further in 2017 
to a current 5 . 2 percent , while real wages 
and pensions increased on the back of 
low inflation . Wage growth was highest 
in the tradable sector and above the rate 
of inflation in the non-tradable and public sectors . However , growth in real disposable incomes remained negative , 
driven by a decline in income from other 
sources , including some not directly registered by statistics . 
The poverty rate under the national definition ( population share with income per 
capita below subsistence minimum level of 
9 , 828 rubles per month in 2016 ) increased 
marginally from 13 . 3 percent in 2015 to 
13 . 4 percent in 2016 . The international 
moderate poverty rate ( population share 
with per capita consumption below 5 . 5 
USD / day in 2011 PPP ) increased from 2 . 7 
percent in 2015 to an estimated 3 . 3 percent 
in 2016 , before decreasing to an estimated 
2 . 9 percent in 2017 , as wages and pensions 
increased . The extreme poverty rate remained marginal , below one percent . 
Outlook
Amid the recovered oil prices , macro stabilization and improved business and 
consumer confidence , we expect Russia ’ s 
economy to keep growing . With the expected price of oil remaining robust at 
US$58 , 59 and 60 / bbl in 2018 , 2019 , and 
2020 respectively , our growth estimates 
stand at 1 . 7 percent in 2018 , 1 . 8 percent in 
2019 and 1 . 8 percent in 2020 . 
The moderate poverty rate is expected to 
fall in 2018 and further through 2019 . As 
public spending is constrained , labor income will become the most important
driver of income growth for the bottom 40 
percent . Wage growth and pension indexation at the inflation level , will support disposable incomes and contribute to a gradual 
decline in the poverty rate . However , many 
households remain close to the poverty line , 
and many individuals lack formal jobs . 
Risks and challenges
External downside risks stem from a significant drop in oil prices , a sudden tightening of global financial conditions and an 
expansion of sanctions . 
The performance of the banking sector is 
expected to remain stable . However , the 
bailout of three large private banks points 
to the continuing fragility in the sector , and 
the quality of capital and assets , and related
-party lending will likely remain a concern . 
Weak productivity growth and a shrinking 
labor force will constrain GDP growth . 
Priority policy objectives include limiting 
the role of the state in the economy , increasing investment , and promoting fair 
competition . Also , measures to improve 
the quality of and access to health and 
education services will be needed to promote longer and more productive working lives .
