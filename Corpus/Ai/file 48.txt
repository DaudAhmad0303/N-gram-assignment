Introduction
Cryptocurrencies have become all the rage over the last few months, especially after the meteoric
rise in the price of Bitcoin back in December 2017. It used to be that cryptocurrency investing
was the realm of experts and savvy investors. But because of Bitcoin's massive success and
popularity after December 2017, things have changed. It has now expanded to include even the
smallest and least experienced of investors. Before going into the details of hodling and
cryptocurrencies in general, it would be very beneficial for you to get a glimpse of how
cryptocurrencies became what they are now.
Brief History of Cryptocurrencies
It all began in the 1990s when American cryptographer, David Chaum, created what was
considered as the first kind of online money in the Netherlands: DigiCash. He created DigiCash
as an extension of an encryption algorithm that was considered popular during those times,
which was RSA. The technology he created, together with its eCash product, was able to
generate a huge amount of attention from the media. It became so popular that Microsoft
Corporation tried to buy DigiCash for $180 million with the intention of placing DigiCash on
every computer in the world that ran on the Windows operating system. One of the crucial
mistakes Chaum and his company made was to reject Microsoft's $180 million offer and earn the
ire of De Nederlandsche Bank (Netherland's Central Bank), which was the Netherland's primary
monetary authority. All of those crucial mistakes eventually led to the demise of DigiCash in
1998, when the company went bankrupt.
The second generation of Internet money was borne from the learning experiences of DigiCash.
Companies from this generation came up with alternative payment solutions and money systems
that were also Internet-based but with small but important changes. Of these companies, the
clear winner was PayPal. The reason why PayPal trumped its competition was its ability to give
users what they really wanted in the first place, which was money on the web browser platforms
they were already familiar with. PayPal - unlike its peers back in the day - was able to give its
users the ability to transfer money to and from merchants and buyers, respectively, using a
seamless peer-to-peer money transfer system. PayPal's massive success is very obvious by the
fact that next only to credit cards, it's the most popular means by which to transact online.
But wait - there's more! PayPal's success led to other companies emulating it. One of the
systems that tried to walk on the same path as PayPal was e-Gold. Unlike PayPal, its primary
currency was gold, i.e., it received physical gold as deposits from its users and in return, it issued
e-Gold or gold credits. E-Gold was able to manage a relatively healthy amount of cross-border
transactions using gold. But because of the prevalence of fraudulent investment scams like
Ponzi schemes, e-Gold was closed.
The next significant event in the history of cryptocurrencies is the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis
that nearly crippled the financial system of the United States and affected many of the world's
major financial institutions. This event served as some kind of wakeup call to many of the
world's major economies and has led to the emergence of what is now popularly known as the
blockchain, which is the foundation of cryptocurrencies today as we know them.
In 2009, an anonymous person (or group) that went by the identity of Satoshi Nakamoto
published a white paper that expounded, among other things, the source code, technology and
concept of what is now called the blockchain. And together with the blockchain, he launched the
granddaddy of all cryptocurrencies as we know it; Bitcoin. The blockchain, while not an
earthshattering, disruptive or incremental technology, was considered a foundational one. Why
foundational? It's because it was meant to - and it still does - serve as a bedrock upon other data
network storage technologies can be built. The blockchain naturally challenges all the
conventional online data management protocols of that time, which included centralization of
data.
Today, there are more than 16 million units of Bitcoin that are circulating in the digital financial
system and these have a total market capitalization of around $50 billion. More importantly,
Bitcoin's already garnering increasing acceptance and support from both the I.T. and business
communities alike. As part of its gradual integration into the financial mainstream, some
economic powerhouse countries like Australia, Canada and Japan have already begun regulating
Bitcoins through tax and legal measures.
Since 2009, the growth in the popularity of the blockchain and Bitcoins has surged. This surge
in popularity gave birth to other cryptocurrencies, which are referred to as altcoins or alternative
coins to Bitcoin. Today, there are more than 850 cryptocurrencies in the digital financial system
being transacted internationally, which include Ethereum (Ether), Ripple, Litecoin, Monero and
Stratis. And if you combine the total market capitalization of all altcoins with that of Bitcoin, the
result would exceed $100 billion.
Because of the massive expansion of cryptocurrencies, it appears that cryptocurrencies have
created an entirely new and global industry. Because of the massive advances in the blockchain
technology, as evidenced by the growth in the number of cryptocurrencies on the market today,
newly developed apps that will be created upon the blockchain technology will naturally use
cryptocurrencies. And as more and more cryptocurrency platforms and exchanges start to
emerge, more and more people will be able to use blockchain-based apps, which in turn will
make the latter industry grow even more.
Ethereum
When talking about the history of cryptocurrencies, a discussion of the second biggest and most
established cryptocurrency - Ethereum - can't be ignored. Ether - as it's more commonly referred
to - is an open source blockchain platform that features among others, a collection of
programming languages upon which other blockchain apps can be built (Decentralized Apps),
the Ethereum Virtual Machine, and smart contracts.
Ether's a relatively young altcoin compared to most other major ones, having been created only
in late 2013, by a dude named Vitalik Buterin and publicly launched in July 2015. But
considering its relatively young age, Ether has been able to garner unmatched support from the
business, consumer and developer communities because of the massive promise it has shown. Its
market capitalization has already exceeded $30 billion and because of its open source nature,
Ether has made it possible for a lot of startup companies to create their own cryptocurrencies on
its platform. And Ether's popularity is expected to increase even more because of its trademark
Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (a group of international and cutting-edge businesses that both use
and assist the Ethereum platform), its technological advantage over all other blockchain
platforms, its relatively huge developer community, and its relatively easy development.
The Future of Cryptocurrencies
One of the main motivations that fuel the development of cryptocurrencies is the breaking down
of existing financial and technological barriers and borders, particularly in the realm of trade and
finance. More than 1,000 altcoins are vying with each other in terms of early blockchain
developmental stages. As a result, we can reasonably expect to see only a couple of successful
cryptocurrencies to stay and change the way we will pay, lend money, borrow money, trade, and
do banking in the future. And in the near future, we can reasonably expect several major
cryptocurrencies to be accepted in the financial mainstream, which can signal a whole new era of
digital finance.
HODLing
The main topic of this book is hodling. But what does hodl mean? The first instance when this
term was used was in 2013 at the Bitcoin talk forum. One of its members with the handle
GameKyuubi used the term hodl under a thread named "I Am Hodling." It appears from the post
that while trying to convey his conviction of holding on to his Bitcoins despite how its prices
nosedived at that time, he was drunk. As a result, he seems to have misspelled the world "hold"
as "hodl." And it seems to have caught on with a lot of people because the word has become
very popular in the cryptocurrency industry to the point that many cryptocurrency
traders/investors use it to communicate the idea that they're holding on to their cryptocurrencies
regardless of what happens. And what was once considered a typographical error has since
evolved into a funny acronym: Holding On for Dear Life.
How to Use This Guide
This book is meant to help or guide you to increase your chances of successfully hodling
cryptocurrencies, i.e., making good money out of them. After all, there's only one reason or
motivation for holding on to financial assets, and that's to earn significant returns from them.
Otherwise, what's the point?
This book is divided into 5 parts; a discussion on the nature of money or fiat currencies, what
makes cryptocurrencies work and worth investing in, general principles for safely holding your
Bitcoins or other cryptocurrencies, why Bitcoin is here to stay and how to invest in or hodl
cryptocurrencies. By the end of the book, you'll be in a very good position to start hodling
cryptocurrencies. But the best way to use this guide is to act on the information it gives.
Without application, everything you'll learn here is just trivia. This book's value, as well as that
of any other non-fiction or self-help book, is in the application of knowledge. So after finishing
this book, I strongly encourage you to act on what you've learned.
Chapter 1: What is Money?
To better understand or appreciate cryptocurrencies, it's important to get a good grasp of the
nature of money. This is because cryptocurrencies are a form of money and by understanding
the true nature of money, especially what important characteristics it should possess, you'll be
able to better appreciate and understand the nature of cryptocurrencies. And in turn, you'll be
able to better understand the principle of hodling.
What is Money?
At its very core, money is something that is used to represent the value of other things. For
example, you gave me money in exchange for receiving a copy of this book, and that sum of
money represents the value of this book. The money I received from you and others who have
bought this book, I'll use to purchase or acquire something of value from other vendors today or
tomorrow. If you study history, you'll see that the values of things have been expressed in
different forms and money, the primary way by which values have been expressed has come in
different shapes and materials. Case in point, things like gold, shells, wheat and salt have been
used in the past to represent value and as a medium of exchange. But for something to be able to
continue representing value, the people who are using it must continue trusting that a medium of
exchange is indeed valuable and more importantly, its value will persist for a long time so that
they will still be able to benefit from it in the future.
How People's Trust in Money Has Evolved
Only until one or two centuries ago, societies had always placed their trust in something when it
comes to the value or representation of money. But the way people trust in money has shifted
from trusting something to trusting someone. What do I mean by this?
In the past, people would use - as I mentioned earlier - stuff like gold, wheat, salt and even
seashells as a medium of exchange or money. But over time, people caught on to the fact that
using such things as a measure of value and medium of exchange can be quite burdensome. Can
you imagine buying your groceries with seashells or salt? What if inflation was very high the
last several years and you want to buy a month's worth of groceries? Can you imagine bringing
that much salt to the supermarket? And if you're the grocery owner, can you imagine having to
weigh the salt being paid to you by your customers and needing a very large space and vehicle to
store and transport all that salt? And what if it rains? Do you get the picture?
Because of such inconvenience, people were forced to improvise and come up with a more
practical value storage and payment solution; paper money! So this was how it worked in the
beginning. When you take up a bank or the government's offer to take physical possession of
your gold bars for storage, they'd issue you certificates or bills for the amount or value of the
gold you deposited with them. Say your gold bars were worth $500, the bank or the government
taking possession of your gold bars would issue you a paper certificate or bills worth $500.
Now think about this. Which is easier to carry around - paper bills worth $500 or gold worth
$500? Another thing to think about is this. Which is easier to cut in smaller pieces or value,
paper bills or a gold bar? If you want to buy a bag of chips for $5, you'd only have to give the
cashier five $1 bills, but if you're carrying around $500 worth of gold, you'd have to cut it
proportionately to an amount that closely or exactly represents $5.
Another thing worth thinking about back in the day is this. If you wanted your gold bars back,
all you'd need to do is give $500 worth of bills or certificates back to the bank or government to
redeem your gold bars. It's that simple. Because of the convenience and practicality it brings,
paper money has grown so much in popularity and has become the primary means by which
goods and services are bought and sold all over the world today.
Back in the day, the value of the United States dollar was linked or based on gold. The money of
the United States of America was valued based on its gold holdings. This was referred to as the
Gold Standard. But over time, the macro economy has changed and as a result, the link
connecting the value of the United States dollar to the value of gold was cut. As a result,
Americans - and the rest of the world, considering the US$ has become the world's primary
currency - had been conditioned to shift their trust from gold to the Federal government. In other
words, people have been conditioned to shift their trust when it comes to monetary value from
something - gold - to someone who assumed responsibility for the value of the dollar, which is
the Federal government. And the only reason this system continues to work is trust because let's
face it, there's no real underlying asset of worth behind the value of the dollar or other
currencies. This was how fiat or paper money was born.
Fiat Money
The word "fiat" is a Latin word that's best interpreted as "by decree." This means that any fiat
currency, i.e., paper money, only has value because their respective governments say so. As a
result of such legal decrees of value, paper or fiat currencies are also called "legal tender" which
means they have to be accepted for payment of goods and services in their respective countries.
That being said, you can now see that money as we know it today has value only because of its
legal status, which is declared by governments. As I mentioned earlier, the trust in the value of
money has shifted from something (gold) to someone (the government).
Now fiat money as we know it now has some pretty serious issues. These are being centralized
and are practically unlimited in quantity. Being centralized means that there's a central or lone
authority that has the power to issue and control its supply, which in the case of the United States
dollar is the Federal Reserve. It's also practically unlimited in quantity because the Federal
Reserve has the power and capability to print or mint more units of the US dollar if it chooses to
do so. Now, why is this a serious concern?
The reason is one of the most basic principles of economics; supply and demand. To be more
specific, this means that when the supply of an object is increased, the value of that object will
tend to decrease assuming demand for that thing remains constant. Conversely, when the supply
of an item is decreased, assuming constant demand, the value will increase. So if the Federal
Reserve or any monetary authority prints more money, it'll flood markets with more of that
currency, which can make it worth less, i.e., buy less of goods and services. So when you see the
prices of goods and services rising substantially over the long term, it's not necessarily because
they became more expensive but because the value of the currency, e.g., the United States dollar,
has dropped due to increased supply.
Digitizing Money
The establishment of fiat money has made it easy - even mandatory - to create digital ones. The
advent of the Internet and establishment of monetary authorities that control and issue money
have made the idea of digitizing money, i.e., making the most of digital or online currencies and
letting such authorities keep tabs on who owns how much, a feasible and even necessary one.
Proof of this is the evolution of alternative modes of payment to the point that they have become
the main methods for transacting today.
For example, credit cards, fund transfers and PayPal have become standard forms of payment
these days. And in the United States, in particular, paying in cash is looked upon as
unconventional or even suspicious in some cases. The ramifications of this evolution are huge.
One of them is the ever shrinking amount of physical money circulating in many of the world's
biggest economies and financial systems. As mentioned earlier, it's highly unusual now to pay
for stuff in cash in the United States, unless you're talking about mom-and-pop stores and other
very small businesses.
Becoming exceedingly digitized, how does money in its digital form work? And a more specific
concern with the digitalization of money is this. What systems are in place to prevent doublespending of money, i.e., what's to stop me from digitally reproducing my money so that I'd have
so much more than what I actually have? You know, like creating duplicate copies of my
favorite songs for listening on my different devices.
Most financial institutions today address this issue with centralization. What this means is
there's only one party responsible for keeping records of financial transactions under a particular
system, i.e., keeping track of who owns what and how much. Everyone who transacts under
such systems has an account, which has a specific ledger under which all transactions and
balances are recorded and maintained. Everyone - including you and me - trust the systems of
financial institutions to keep accurate records of our balances and these institutions, in turn, trust
their computer systems. In short, the solution of centralization of records is based on a ledger
that's stored in one big-ass computer system or network. Prior to the creation of the blockchain,
there have been many attempts to create alternative digital forms of payment that have failed
because of one very important issue; preventing double-spending sans a central authority. That's
why the centralized records keeping solution has persisted until this day - it generally works.
Challenges Posed By a Centralized Monetary System
Whenever we give someone or a group of people total authority over something, there will be
serious challenges that will need to be addressed. When it comes to doing so over the monetary
system, there are three specific challenges that need to be addressed and these are corruption,
mismanagement, and control.
There's a saying that absolute power corrupts absolutely. Central banks or monetary authorities
such as the Federal Reserve, who have the legal mandates to print money and create value in the
process, practically have the ability to control how value is created and destroyed in their
respective countries and in the case of the Federal Reserve, in the whole world. And such legal
mandates are akin to unlimited or absolute financial power. A very good example of this is the
fiasco at Wells Fargo where its employees were ordered to clandestinely open fictitious bank and
credit card accounts in an attempt to puff up the company's revenues and consequently, its net
profits, for several years. And compared to monetary authorities, Wells Fargo isn't even an
authority.
Mismanagement is simply when a manager or a steward acts in a way that is not consistent with
how his or her boss - the owner - wants him or her to act. Mismanagement - in the case of
monetary authorities - can happen when governments act against the interest of the people they
govern. A very good example of this is the way the United States monetary authorities allowed
major financial institutions to issue credit-linked notes or financial derivatives with mortgages
that have very high default risks, which corrupt credit ratings agencies have rated as "investment
grade." This has resulted in the near collapse of the United States financial system, which the
Federal Reserve rescued by acting against the interest of the public by using public money,
which the public has objected to, to save the biggest financial institutions from collapsing in
2008.
Another issue of mismanagement is printing of new money without proper consideration of the
deflationary effects of such an action. As mentioned earlier, printing more money floods the
financial system with too much money, which in turn can cause a specific currency's value to
plunge or drop (law of supply and demand, remember?). A very good case of this is the
Venezuelan government, who mismanaged the country's financial system and official currency
by printing too much money. The Venezuelan currency has become practically worthless to the
point that people started to measure its value by weight instead of amount.
Lastly, a central monetary authority means surrendering all control over the people's money to
the government. Because governments have the legal mandate to control the money supply, they
also have the authority to control your money in ways that can prove to be very unfavorable or
unjust to you, e.g., freezing your bank accounts and keeping you from accessing your money.
Keeping physical cash on hand doesn't mean the government can't keep you from beneficially
using your money. Governments can still keep you from using your money for your benefit
simply by revoking its legal tender status so you won't be able to use it for transactions, such as
what India did in the past.
Gold And Silver
Let's talk about gold and silver. Why? Because of its connection to money. To be more
specific, gold and silver aren't just investments - they're money! You might say "No, money is
the US dollar or the British Pound!" Sorry to burst your bubble but those are merely currencies,
as is the case with all fiat currencies in the world. But currency is different from money. First,
currency is just a legal tender status, the value of which isn't determined by the people but by
governments. Second, legit money has important characteristics that make it so and the United
States dollar doesn't have all of them and as such, money is more than just a medium of
exchanging goods and services. Here are the seven characteristics of legit money:
1) Durability, which is the reason why wheat and salt are no longer used as money;
2) Divisibility, which is the reason why paintings and other pieces of art aren't used as
money;
3) Convenience of use, which is why copper or lead isn't used as money;
4) Consistency in value, which is why real estate is hardly used - if ever - to pay for goods
or services;
5) It must have intrinsic value or value as it is, which is why paper isn't really money;
6) It must be limited in available quantity, which is the reason for not using iron or rocks as
money; and
7) And lastly, it should have a long track record of acceptability.
Upon close evaluation, you'll find that only gold and silver actually meet these characteristics. If
you look at financial assets like stocks, bonds, or even real estate, they don't pass the consistency
test because their prices tend to fluctuate. For others likes stocks, chances are that stocks of
companies from 100 years ago - save for a few big and strong ones - have either deteriorated in
value or are no longer worth anything because the companies whose ownerships such stocks
represent no longer exist. The only items whose purchasing powers have not only been
maintained but have also increased over the long-term are gold and silver. If only for this
characteristic alone, gold and silver have kicked the butts of many currencies that have failed
over the last 5,000 years. And if you factor in the fact that gold and silver are the only items that
continue to have high value since the early days of all civilizations on Earth, you'll see why fiat
currencies aren't really money.
Gold And Silver: Can Their Values Be Manipulated?
To answer this question, I'll focus the discussion more on gold. Gold price manipulation is
defined as any intentional efforts to control the prices of this most precious metal. This
supposedly happens in major financial markets when gold traders intentionally attempt to
influence gold prices via certain financial instruments, particularly derivatives. These traders
may have been able to successfully cause short-term deviations from the real values of gold, but
over the long-term, it doesn't appear to be so.
The United States' Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) defines manipulation in greater
detail as any intentional act whose purpose is to trick investors by artificially affecting or
controlling the market for a specific asset and includes activities like quote rigging, and
voluminous trades or transactions that are meant to paint a deceptive impression of demand for a
particular asset and sway market prices in their (traders') favor. And when speaking of gold
price manipulation, there's one particular type of manipulation that is believed to be prevalent
and that is price suppression, i.e., manipulating gold prices downward.
A really good question to ask then is this. Are the prices of gold - and consequently silver -
manipulated? If you ask enough number of gold traders or investors, they'll tell you that it can
be. Even more, they'll probably tell you that they are being systematically manipulated right this
very moment. Are they right?
There are several iterations of this belief. One is that central bankers control the prices of
precious metals. Another iteration of this belief is that greedy private commercial bankers are
the ones manipulating gold prices downward through derivative instruments (short-selling and
futures contracts) and high-volume trades meant to paint a scenario of low and decreasing
demand for gold and silver. When you look at theories like these, they seem plausible at first
glance because of instances where gold prices were controlled in the past, such as when certain
governments fixed the prices of gold for decades or when the London Gold Pool suppressed its
prices. Add to the fact that very rarely do financial institutions get penalized for gold price
manipulation and you have a very prevalent belief that indeed, gold and silver prices can be
manipulated.
But if you look at the long-term price histories of gold and silver, it becomes exceedingly clear
that the answer to our question is no, prices of these precious metals can't be manipulated.
Check out academic papers on the subject and you'll find that no compelling evidence for the
case of price suppression or manipulation exists. In fact, you'll find very clear cyclical patterns if
you check out the long-term price charts of these two precious metals.
From a long-term view, particularly of the 2000s, you'll probably start to wonder how the heck
people believed that price suppression for these two precious metals existed. And when you
think about crying wolf, you may start to wonder why manipulation is selective, i.e.,
manipulation is responsible when prices go down and when prices are going up, it's the market
that's pushing it up. And while we can't disprove the belief that the world's biggest players
attempt to manipulate prices, their effects - if any - are very short-lived because it's practically
impossible to suppress the true market price of gold in the market. Those who want to suppress
the price of gold and silver over the long-haul simply don't have enough financial resources to do
so. And any attempts to do so will only backfire soon because any significant drops in the prices
of gold and silver will only increase demand for it and consequently, lead to an increase in their
prices.
Naked Short-Selling
Many investors and traders of these 2 precious metals tend to certain financial institutions,
particularly bullion banks, of naked short-selling in order to put downward pressure on prices.
But does naked short-selling mean? Short-selling means selling something you don't have. So if
you talk about short-selling gold bullions, it means you're selling gold bullions you don't have
yet.
Now, why would you sell something you don't have yet and get into a whole lot of trouble for
it? After all, isn't selling something you don't have considered fraud? Well, not really. You may
not have the gold bullions yet, but you can borrow other people's gold bullion to sell them. And
when the price of gold bullions drops, you can buy the same amount of gold bullions you
borrowed for short-selling and in the process, make money. This type of short-selling is called
"covered" short-selling because you cover yourself by first borrowing enough gold bullions to
sell.
Naked short-selling is uncovered short-selling, i.e., you sell the bullions you don't have even
when you haven't borrowed any to sell yet. Naked short-selling also happens when you shortsell gold bullions without any guarantee from other people that you can borrow enough bullions
for short-selling from them. Naked short-selling can put you or any trader who does it at high
risk of not being able to deliver the gold bullions sold to the buyer. Thus, the potential impact of
naked shorts can be very serious.
There are "rumors" or "urban legends" that accuse the Federal government of using bullion banks
to execute tons of naked gold short sales on the Commodities Exchange on its behalf to suppress
the price of gold, maintain the US dollar's value, and gives these bullion banks the opportunity to
make huge money by repurchasing the bullions at lower prices. Sounds so evil and believable,
right?
But think about this: if the number of naked short-sellers and there naked-short positions were
that significant, the drop in prices of gold would be so huge that it would generate a reciprocal
spike in demand for it. And the huge spike in demand would just wipe out the price drop
because of the law of supply and demand.
Another thing to consider is the practicality of executing huge amounts of naked short sales just
to suppress or manipulate the price of gold or silver. To execute this strategy effectively to drop
the price of these 2 precious metals, naked short selling institutions would have to purchase a
huge number of futures contracts just to cover their naked short positions. And as the futures
contracts mature, they'd either have to buy the actual amounts of huge metals per futures
contracts bought or rollover their positions, buy contracts that will be expiring, and flip the next
ones out. In either case, the institutions involved in naked short-selling for price suppression will
need to eventually unwind their positions, which will ultimately reverse or neutralize any price
suppression effects of their attempted naked short sales. And this explains why naked shortselling for price suppression isn't realistic and why you'll see that based on long-term price charts
for both gold and silver, their values follow cycles or patterns.
The main point of it all is this is that, despite the many conspiracy theories of price manipulation
for gold and silver, proof of such is lacking. As for all financial assets whose values are marketdriven, there are bull and bearish markets over the long-term. Bear markets - or when prices are
falling - don't equate to price manipulation any more than bull markets - when prices are going
up - do. It's all about market demand, cycles, and the ability to time our transactions well.
Chapter 2: Why Cryptocurrencies Work
Now that you've seen why compared to gold, fiat currencies aren't real money; it's time to turn
our attention to cryptocurrencies as a solid alternative, why they are much closer to gold than
money as we know it today is, and why they'd work better than fiat currencies.
Low Risk of Disruption
According to David John Grundy, the global blockchain head of one of the world's biggest
banks, Danske Bank, the only way anyone can stop or shut blockchains down is by shutting
down the Internet itself. And by now, I believe you know that is practically impossible. It's like
saying somebody can keep the sun from shining or the wind from blowing.
Portability
Unlike fiat currencies, cryptocurrencies can be easily transferred from one account to another
using online gadgets such as computers, tablets or even smartphones. With fiat currencies, you'll
need to do so physically or through the same bank. Plus, you don't have to bring them with you
physically because they're stored in the Internet. So you can go anywhere with a good Internet
connection and bring your cryptocurrencies with you regardless of the amount!
Better Value Storage
You can only consider an asset as a good value storage if it's able to keep relatively unchanged
levels of utility or satisfaction over time. Applying this to financial assets, it means having the
ability to maintain purchasing power over time. A financial asset's ability to keep value can be
estimated through what is called as fundamental analysis, which takes into consideration both the
quantitative and qualitative aspects of such an asset.
The ability to keep or store value has become the primary foundation for investing or HODLing
cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and others. But can cryptocurrencies be really relied on
to store value and if they are, can they do it well?
The Gold Comparison
Don't be surprised to find cryptocurrencies being compared or likened to precious metals, i.e.,
Bitcoin to gold and Litecoin or Ether to silver when justifying cryptocurrencies' ability to store
value over the long term. One of the reasons - albeit a shallow one - is the color of
cryptocurrencies. Bitcoins are visually represented as color gold while Litecoins are visually
represented as silver. But there are more than just visual cues that justify the belief in
cryptocurrencies' ability to store values like the two most precious metals on Earth. We mustn't
dismiss behavioral economics that underlie both asset classes. When more and more people start
believing that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ether, or Litecoin are able to store value the way
precious metals like gold and silver can, it can help push the prices of these cryptocurrencies
upward. When their prices do go up over time, then it's highly possible that they'll be able to
keep or maintain their values within a specific period of time.
Comparisons to precious metals, e.g., Bitcoins to gold, can be a very strong factor that can
influence the perspective of general markets regarding Bitcoin’s and altcoin's abilities to retain or
store value in the long term. And this can have a huge impact in terms of the number of
investors who'll view cryptocurrencies in general as good investment vehicles.
Limited Quantity, i.e., Deflationary
Just like gold in its physical form, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin typically have a limited quantity
of units, which is defined or set in their respective blockchain protocols. Bitcoin, for example,
has a cap of only 21 million units that can ever be created. Litecoin on the other hand has an 84-
million unit cap that's also controlled by its operating protocols. This is what makes
cryptocurrencies deflationary or disinflationary over the long haul.
Remember our discussion earlier on supply and demand and how asset values are affected by
changes in both? Because cryptocurrencies have a fixed number of units that will ever be
minted, their supplies relative to the quantities of goods and services it can buy in the future is
effectively shrinking. That means its purchasing power can be expected to increase over the long
haul and can have deflationary effects on goods and services.
Independence from Other Asset Classes
Compared to all other financial asset classes such as stocks or fiat currencies whose values
fluctuate depending on the pronouncements or moves made by central bankers or financial
regulators, the real value of gold and silver can't be manipulated by any central monetary
authority regardless of their macro-policy decisions. Because of its autonomy from any
monetary authority, precious metals like gold and silver are able to withstand price shocks over
time, which makes them very good storages of value in the long term.
Cryptocurrencies are like gold in that they're generally decentralized and autonomous by nature.
This means just like gold, government decisions or policy changes have little direct impact, if at
all, on their long-term values. The amount of decentralization and autonomy can be a hot
discussion topic among cryptocurrency users and investors, where some favor the full autonomy
version while others feel more comfortable with some compromise, i.e., hybrid combinations of
some form of governance (not from the government) and decentralization. In general,
cryptocurrency governance models can vary greatly with some adopting a balanced power
structure among its users when it comes to major decision making on one end while others go for
the benevolent dictatorship model on the other hand. And in between the two are various other
combination or hybrid models. But generally speaking, cryptocurrencies with more
decentralized systems may do a better risk in terms of hedging against the risk of their values
being influenced or tampered with by regulators.
Underlying or Intrinsic Values
Assets that are considered to be true storages of value have underlying characteristics that serve
as foundations for their values. In layman's terms, such assets have intrinsic utility values, i.e.,
practical uses that give them their values. Gold, for example, is used for manufacturing jewelry
and electronic parts such as semi-conductors. Land or real estate's underlying value or utility is
their capacity for having structures built upon them and the amount of foot traffic their areas get.
When it comes to underlying utility value, cryptocurrencies have a lot of potential. In particular,
cryptocurrencies hold a huge promise in terms of changing the way financial transactions are
done online, which include contracts enforcement, records keeping, and payments. As the use of
cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ether becomes accepted in more and more markets,
their practical utility values increase even more, which can increase their values over the long
haul.
Impossible To Fake
The blockchain technology is a revolutionary one in terms of facilitating online transactions and
data or record keeping. Being such, it's practically impossible to produce counterfeit versions of
it. And as blockchains continue to evolve, it becomes even more impossible - if such a term
exists - to produce fake cryptocurrencies that can be used to buy stuff.
Impossible to Control
Particularly for cryptocurrencies whose market capitalizations are already in the billions of
dollars such as Bitcoin and Ether, one would need a huge amount of money to transact enough
units of such cryptocurrencies just to be able to influence or manipulate their prices. When you
take a look at Bitcoin, for example, whose average market capitalization hovers somewhere
around US$50 billion, one would need at least US$10 billion to play around just to be able to
manipulate demand and supply. Even if you're talking about Ether, whose average market cap is
much smaller at "only" around US$25 billion to US$30 billion, one would still need a couple of
billion dollar worth of transactions just to sway prices to his or her favor.
The Little Guy Gets In More
Unlike stocks and other financial assets that require relatively high amounts of investment
capital, cryptocurrencies have low barriers to entry. That means even people who only have
relatively small amounts of money to invest can easily get in. As such, cryptocurrencies, in
general, have a higher number of investors participating in them to the point that it becomes
practically impossible to manipulate the market.
Relative Security
Lastly, cryptocurrencies are virtually impossible to rob if you do your homework of using the
right kind of storage, which we'll talk about later. But if you just leave them in your
cryptocurrency exchange account, that's the only time when it's at high risk of being hacked and
stolen. So if you follow my advice later on regarding storage of your Bitcoins or other
cryptocurrencies, you can make your cryptocurrencies so safe that they'll be practically
impossible to steal.
Chapter 3: How to Store Your Bitcoins or Altcoins Safely
In Chapter 2, I mentioned that if you do your homework and follow my advice, your
cryptocurrencies can be practically impossible to steal or hack. In this chapter, I'll spill the beans
on how you can do that, which can be summarized in 3 words - a cryptocurrency wallet.
A cryptocurrency wallet is where you store your cryptocurrencies. This may be considered a
cryptocurrency investing because the financial assets you're dealing with have no physical
counterparts, i.e., they're digital. And because they're digital, you can only store them via a
digital storage facility, i.e., a cryptocurrency wallet. The only question is what type of wallet
will you use?
There are two general types of wallets: hot storage and cold storage. Hot storage wallets are
those that are online or Internet based. Cold storage wallets, on the other hand, are those that are
offline or aren't connected to the Internet. So which of the two is best for safely HODLing your
cryptocurrencies? If the only way to steal or rob your cryptocurrencies is via hacking, then the
obvious answer is cold storage or offline wallets, which come in two general variants: paper and
hardware. And I suggest using both.
But before I explain how these two cold storage wallets work, allow me to explain how
cryptocurrency storage, particularly the blockchains, works. When you buy cryptocurrencies
from any particular exchange, your transaction is assigned a public key that is linked to the
number of units of a cryptocurrency that you bought. Your cryptocurrency exchange, on the
other hand, assigns private keys that corresponds to your public keys. Therefore, your private
keys are your lifeline to your cryptocurrencies, and if you lose or forget them, you can say
goodbye to your cryptocurrencies.
For others to successfully "steal" your cryptocurrencies, they must get hold of your private keys.
It's like your ATM card's personal identification number, which will allow other people to
withdraw from your account without your permission. When you leave your cryptocurrencies in
your hot wallet, i.e., your cryptocurrency exchange account, you put them at risk of being hacked
and stolen. That's why as soon as you're done buying your cryptocurrencies, you must transfer
them, including your private keys, to your cold storage or offline wallet.
Ok, now that we've got that covered, I can explain how the paper and hardware wallets work.
The paper wallet isn't really a wallet but more of a backup. Write your private keys on a piece of
paper and put that paper in a place where it's virtually impossible to steal or destroy them. A
very good place to do so is a fire-proof vault or safe. Another's a safety deposit box.
Hardware wallets are USB-type devices that you can store your cryptocurrencies and its private
keys in. These are devices whose sole purpose is to hold your cryptocurrencies and as such,
they're offline most of the time. To use them to receive or transfer your cryptocurrencies from
and to your cryptocurrency exchange account for executing transactions, you only need to plug it
into the USB port of your Internet-connected desktop or laptop computer and follow
instructions.
Cold storage hardware wallets are much safer compared to software wallets, i.e., apps installed
on gadgets for two reasons. One is if it's installed on a device that's mostly online, then the risk
for getting hacked is still fairly high. Second, even if you install it on a device that you only
connect to the Internet for transacting in cryptocurrencies, there's still a risk of loss if that
computer is damaged beyond repair or even if it can still be repaired, the computer technician to
whom you'll have it repaired can possibly hack the drive and consequently, your wallet. With a
hardware cold storage wallet, the risk of losing your private keys due to hardware damage is
much, much lower. Further, using a paper wallet as a backup can help mitigate such a risk.
Some of the most popular hardware wallets include Trezor, KeepKey, and Ledger Nano. They
may cost a bit, but they're worth the investment.
Chapter 4: Is Bitcoin dead?
Because of the rapid rise in value of Bitcoin, especially in December 2017 when its market price
quadrupled in just a couple of weeks, and its subsequent price retreat in January 2018, many
people were led to believe that Bitcoin's just an asset bubble that has already popped. In other
words, they believe that Bitcoin's as good as dead.
But while the huge returns Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies have generated in a
relatively short period of time is reminiscent of the Internet and Holland Tulip bubbles in the
past, it's fundamentally different than those two assets. As such, Bitcoin and other noteworthy
altcoins have a much brighter future compared to the two aforementioned assets.
The following are indicators that Bitcoin isn't dead yet and more importantly, it's going to be
around for a long, long while.
More and More Legal
Not to say that Bitcoin's an illegal endeavor but what I'm saying is that it's becoming more and
more accepted as legal tender. You see, one of the most serious challenges facing Bitcoin with
regards to being accepted in the financial services mainstream is acceptance by government
monetary authorities (lawmakers and regulators alike), which is hampered by its decentralized
and autonomous nature. Governments hate what they can't control so Bitcoin's not exactly in
their good graces - at least not yet. But recent developments in major economies indicate that
government acceptance, in general, is becoming more and more likely.
Japan announced back in April 2017 that it would officially start treating Bitcoin as a valid or
legal alternative payment method and as of 2018, it already is. This has made Bitcoin practically
part of the Japanese mainstream financial system as more and more merchants in the Land of the
Rising Sun have officially started accepting Bitcoin payments.
Other major world economies like Russia and Australia have also released similar statements
indicative of Bitcoin being accepted as a form of legal tender in their respective economies soon.
As more and more major world economies accept Bitcoin as a legit payment method, the rest of
the world is highly likely to follow suit.
More Stores
More than just government pronouncements, Bitcoin's acceptance among merchants continues to
rise because of the confidence shown by some of the world's biggest companies in accepting
payments using the granddaddy of all cryptocurrencies. These companies include Microsoft,
Overstock, and Rakuten.
But more than just riding on the bandwagon of these big companies, there are fundamentally
sound reasons for the rising number of merchant acceptance of Bitcoin. One of them is
transaction fees, which are much less than what credit cards charge to its merchants. Other
practical advantages Bitcoin as payment has are the ability to reach new customers from regions
in the world that are not yet reached by mainstream banking institutions and elimination of
chargeback fraud. With the expected rise in mainstream acceptance by merchants, demand for
Bitcoin is expected to rise and of course, its price can be reasonably expected to rise over the
long term as well.
Wealth Storage
Remember our discussion in a previous chapter concerning cryptocurrencies' ability to store
value and its relationship with functional value? The increasing acceptance of Bitcoin in many
of the world's financial markets, particularly in countries that are experiencing economic distress,
gives the granddaddy of all cryptocurrencies increasing functional value. In such distressed
economies as Bolivia and Venezuela, local currencies' values continue to deteriorate to the point
of becoming worthless. In such economies, Bitcoin is becoming more and more accepted as a
mode of payment, which means its functional or utilitarian value is increasing. So as their local
currencies are becoming less and less valuable, Bitcoin is becoming more and more precious and
as a result, is becoming an even better storage of value for citizens of such countries.
Walking Dead...No!
As you can see, Bitcoin's very much alive and kicking and based on the indicators I've just
enumerated, you can expect it to continue staying alive. Bitcoin, being the granddaddy of all
cryptocurrencies, has the highest market capitalization and best performance track record, both
of which will continue to make Bitcoin more and more accepted in the international financial
mainstream. And as that happens, the likelihood of Bitcoin dropping dead will become even
more statistically impossible.
Chapter 5: Cryptocurrency Pre-Hodling Strategies
Before we discuss how to hodl in more detail, I want to make a distinction between two
investment methods: the long-term approach and the short-term approach. The short-term
approach is more popularly known as trading, i.e., buying and selling of financial assets within a
relatively short turnaround time like within a few hours, or at most, a couple of weeks. The
long-term approach, also known by the names buy-and-hold and buy-it-forget-it, is an approach
where the investment time horizon is - you probably guessed it right - long. By long, I mean at
least 1 year.
Hodling falls under the long-term, buy-and-hold approach. Hodling has its share of advantages
over the short-term approach. One of them is time. With the short-term approach, you have to
be on top of your positions most of the time so you can time your transactions well. This is
especially true for financial assets whose prices are very volatile, like cryptocurrencies. With the
long-term approach, the bulk of the work you'll need to do will be prior to buying your financial
assets, i.e., research. After doing your homework, you buy the financial asset you believe is your
best bet and forget about it. All you'll need to do is update yourself on the price of your
investment once a week or even once a month. Because your investment view is long-term, you
won't be affected by the price fluctuations in between and hence, only need minimal
management or monitoring.
Another advantage is cost. In a perfect world, every transaction shouldn't cost a dime. But our
world ain't perfect so you'll need to pay transactions fees for every financial investment
transaction. With trading, you'll trade more often, which means more transactions fees. With a
long-term approach, a.k.a. hodling, the number of transactions you'll have to make are few and
far in between, which means less transactions fees.
Now that I've gotten the distinction out of the way let's jump into how to significantly increase
your chances of hodling successfully. For better appreciation and understanding, I'll divide this
topic into two main sections: Before and during hodling. We'll focus on before HODLing in this
chapter.
Ask Yourself Why
Remember what I wrote earlier about how bulk of your hodling work will be in the beginning,
i.e., prior to your actually hodling your cryptocurrency investments? Good. Now let's buckle
down to work! The very first thing you'll need to do is know your reason for hodling.
When you examine the lives of people who have achieved so much in their lives, one common
thread that runs through them is awareness of their life purpose. In other words, they know why
they're doing what they're doing. And more importantly, I guarantee you that if you examine
each of their reasons, you'll find those reasons to be very meaningful or compelling ones.
Therefore, you'll need to have a compelling reason for hodling any financial asset, which in this
case is cryptocurrencies.
Why is this crucial? Hodling successfully will require self-control and perseverance, especially
during times that prices are down, i.e., bear markets. It is during such moments when your
emotions can become so strong that they override all logic and make you do things you'll
probably regret later on.
But while anybody's reason for hodling's very obvious, i.e., make money, it's not a very
compelling one. In fact, it's a very generic and shallow one. I'm talking about a deep,
compelling, and personal reason. To better help, you figure this out, ask yourself deeper
questions such as why do you want to make money of this investment? Is it so you can have
enough money for your child's college education 15 years from now? Is it so you can retire
early? Or is it so you can travel around the world by the time you turn 60 years old? The more
personal and bigger your reasons are, the more compelling they can be.
When you're tempted to switch to a riskier cryptocurrency that's been increasing in value at a
faster rate than the relatively less risky but consistently performing cryptocurrency you're
hodling, knowing that you’re doing this to minimize the risk of your child not being able to go to
college can help you exercise self-control and avoid taking excessive risks and gambling away
your child's future. When you're tempted to unload your cryptocurrencies simply because
they've dropped in value even though all indicators may point to a bright future ahead, knowing
that you're doing this so you can retire early can help you resist the temptation knowing that
unless you actually sell your cryptocurrencies at a loss, your market loss is just a theoretical one
and can still be recovered.
Minimum Rate of Return
When you know how much your investments need to earn at the minimum, it'll be easier for you
to choose your investments wisely. And by wisely, I mean choosing investments that are neither
too safe but unprofitable nor potentially very profitable but also excessively risky. When you
know how much return you need to accomplish your hodling goals, you put yourself in a good
position to take on investments that will help you accomplish your goals for the least possible
risk.
So how do you know you minimum rate of return? First thing you'll need to know is how much
money you need to have by the end of a certain period, e.g., after 5, 10, or 15 years. Then,
determine how much money you can afford to set aside for investing. Finally, determine the rate
of return based on your expected future value (the amount you need to have in the future) and
present value (your available funds for investing or hodling). And when you've determined that,
make it your minimum expected rate of return and choose only those cryptocurrencies whose
average annual rate of return is equal to or more than your minimum required.
Risk Appetite
This refers to how much loss you are willing to take in the event your investments turn sour.
Why is this an important consideration? It's because there's no such thing as risk-free
investments and the higher the expected returns on investments are, the higher the financial risks
you must be willing to take. So there is a possibility that your investments won't be able to give
you the returns you're after. And the worst thing that can happen is you lose money on your
investments, which can be as much as all of it. By knowing how much you're able to
comfortably lose, you'll be able to determine whether or not to invest in a specific financial asset
such as cryptocurrencies. And if you decide you want to invest in a specific financial asset
despite the risk, knowing your risk appetite or tolerance can help you determine how much
money to invest.
When figuring out how much cryptocurrencies to hodl, there are two ways you can estimate your
risk appetite. One way is to think about how much money you can comfortably lose. There are
two benefits to this approach. The first is this: your finances won't be seriously affected if the
worst case scenario happens. Investing your entire savings in cryptocurrencies is a foolish idea
because if the price goes down by a significant amount, you might not have enough money for
your personal needs when something unexpected happens like getting hospitalized or if you
accidentally wreck your car. But if you invest an amount beyond what you really need to live a
comfortable life, you can live with worst case investing or hodling scenarios.
The second benefit to this approach is you won't be pressured when prices of your
cryptocurrencies go down or fluctuate wildly. When that happens, your emotions won't get the
better of you and because you can be more objective when it comes to your cryptocurrency
holdings, your chances of successfully riding out temporary investment "storms" are much
higher.
The other way you can estimate your risk appetite is by determining an amount of money you
strongly believe you won't need to use within the next 1 or 2 years and beyond. How's this a
good basis for determining how much to invest in cryptocurrencies or other financial assets?
Hodling is a long-term endeavor. As such, you need to be able to keep your investments intact
so it can ride out temporary dips in prices if any. For you to be able to do this, you'll need to
make sure that the money you're going to invest is an amount that has a high probability of not
being needed in the near future.
Read the Damn White Papers
Especially if you plan to invest in an initial coin offering or an ICO, which is the cryptocurrency
equivalent of initial public offerings or IPOs of stocks and bonds, you'll need to read the white
papers of the cryptocurrencies you're interested to hodl. But what are white papers?
Before we get to that, we need to talk about ICOs first. An ICO is a way by which creators of a
cryptocurrency raise enough funds to launch a new one. These fundraising activities are
unregulated, considering the autonomous and decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies.
Compared to the usual fundraising activities of mainstream investment banks and other financial
institutions, ICOs are way less rigorous and regulated, which makes them easier to do.
ICOs worth their salt will always give out white papers, which is the ICO equivalent of an IPO's
prospectus. A white paper is a document that elaborates on the details of the fundraising activity,
i.e., ICO. These details include among others the purpose for the fundraising activity. As a
prospective investor, it's crucial that you know as much as you can about the ICO you plan to get
into so you can have a very solid idea of whether or not it's legitimate and whether or not it has
very good investment potential. White papers are written by people from a wide range of
backgrounds who are knowledgeable about the coin or token to be issued as well as the financing
of such like lawyers, PR practitioners, experienced business men, and information technology
experts, among others.
White papers are created and distributed to the investing public to give them a clear idea what the
ICO is really about and in the process, foster a good level of trust from them. White papers - just
like prospectuses - can help establish the legitimacy of an upcoming ICO and thus, is crucial for
its success. And for you, as an investor, the white paper is the primary means by which you can
learn all there is to learn about a soon-to-be-issued cryptocurrency. Through white papers, you
can make the most informed decision possible about whether or not to invest in an ICO. So
when you see an ICO already being sold without a white paper, that should be a red flag already
concerning its legitimacy or if not, the quality of that ICO.
So what are the things a good white paper should contain? These include:
− The ICO's vision;
− The underlying technology for the token;
− The token or the project's unique selling proposition (USP), i.e., what current problems or
challenges it can effectively address, why being able to effectively address such
challenges is important, and the token's unique characteristics;
− How the token will be distributed among its ICO subscribers as well as among the team
behind it;
− Timeline of activities that need to be completed for the ICO;
− Language and focus of the white paper; and
− The people behind the token's development and their credentials.
Details such as these are crucial for your hodling success because these are the things that can
affect the long-term viability of the token in question.
Reading the white papers is very crucial for spotting a potential scam. Of all the details white
papers contain, there are three that can give you a good indication of whether or not the ICOs
they're backing up are legit. These are the vision, the people behind the ICO, and the language
and focus of the paper.
The vision part of white papers gives you an idea if the people behind the ICOs believe that
they'll be around for the long haul or for the short term only. Legit ICOs are in it for the long
haul so if their vision is either short-term or is vague as to the timeline, better think twice.
The people behind ICOs should give you a very good idea of the quality of their quality and their
chances of being able to successfully accomplish their vision. Conduct a background check on
the people identified in the white papers as being part of the core team, particularly their
accomplishments, credentials, and where available, any scandals or issues involving them.
Because they are the people who are responsible for creating and managing the tokens up for sale
in ICOs, they should be the single biggest factors to consider when weighing the chances of
success for ICOs. Or whether or not they're legitimate.
Lastly, the way that white papers are written is another indicator of whether or not they're legit.
In particular, pay close attention to the focus and language of the paper. What's the paper
focusing on? Is it focusing on the benefits with very little or no discussion on risks? If this is the
case, then chances are it's either a very low quality ICO or worse, it may be a scam. Scams tend
to focus on the potential benefits, making them seem almost sure or guaranteed, in order to make
you feel so good about them enough to be duped. Legitimate ICOs disclose relevant investment
risks so their prospective investors can make the most informed decision possible.
What about the language? White papers that are written very poorly, i.e., using inappropriate
language or terms can be indicative of a scam. For example, try watching the TV show
Designated Survivor and one thing you'll probably notice is how realistic the show seems, which
makes it a legit high quality program. And one of the reasons why you'll probably think that way
is because they use terminologies that are actually used in the White House or in politics. In the
same manner, legit white papers will use terms and sentences that you just know is consistent
with the industry. White papers that appear to be written by amateurs is a red flag.
However, white papers that meet these three criterions isn't a guarantee of legitimacy and high
quality, as it's possible for scammers to hire professionals to write very good white papers for
them. But what it does is tell you that there's a very high probability that the ICOs such white
papers back up are legitimate and of good quality. That's why it's also important to research
information outside of white papers. That way, you can validate the information you'll obtain
from them.

Chapter 6: Cryptocurrency Hodling Strategies
Now that you've done your pre-hodling homework, it's time to discuss hodling strategies that can
help you achieve your investment goals.
Use the Minimum Expected Return to Choose Your Cryptocurrencies
After determining your minimum required rate of return, it's time to do a bit more research for
hodling cryptocurrencies that have the highest chances for success. In particular, you must
research on the average rates of return on your prospective cryptocurrencies, particularly if you
plan to buy those that are already being publicly traded. Why? It's because tokens being sold
through ICOs don't have past prices to compute average returns with.
For illustrative purposes, let's say that after doing your research, you find that the average annual
returns on Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin were 30%, 20% and 25%, respectively. If your
minimum required rate of return is 18%, which of the three would you choose? Chances are,
you'd go for Bitcoin without batting an eyelash because it has the highest average annual return
at 30%. I wouldn't say it's wrong but what I can say is that it's incomplete. Why?
When comparing actual returns to average returns, they're rarely the same. Actual returns aren't
equal to the average, but they tend to be within the range of the computed average in most cases.
This means that actual returns can be higher or lower than the computed average by up to a
certain amount. To optimize your chances of being able to achieve your minimum required rate
of return, you'll need to choose investments whose most conservative estimated or forecasted
future returns equal or exceed your minimum. And for this, you'll need to compute for the
standard deviation, which measures the volatility of returns or how far can you reasonably expect
returns for a specific investment to be from the mean or average return computed. Allow me to
illustrate this in a way that you can easily understand.
Let's say that the computed standard deviation for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin were 15%,
3%, and 7%, respectively. What do these figures mean? It means that you can reasonably (not
perfectly) expect the return for Bitcoin this year to range from 15% (30% -15%) to 45% (30% +
15%), where 15% is the lowest expected return for Bitcoin for next year. For Ethereum, the
annual return for this year to range from 17% (20% - 3%) to 23% (20% + 3%) and for Litecoin
from 18% (25% - 7%) to 32% (25% + 7%).
Now, compare the lowest expected returns for each of the three cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin's is
15%, Ethereum's is 17%, and Litecoin's is 18%. Given your minimum required rate of return,
the wise choice would be Litecoin because its lowest expected annual return for this year is the
only one that satisfies your 18% minimum requirement. Without the benefit of standard
deviation, you could've gone for Bitcoin, which has a reasonable chance of registering a lower
annual return than your required minimum. And even though its mean or average annual return's
the highest, it's also the most volatile with the highest standard deviation, which resulted in the
lowest among the low end of the expected return spectrums.
Diversify
A very crucial hodling strategy that you can apply to practically any financial investments, it
means to spread your investment eggs in different baskets so that if one investment basket drops,
your other investment eggs won't crack. And more than just investing in at least 2
cryptocurrencies, you must also make sure that you don't put all your investible funds in
cryptocurrencies only. Why?
Because Bitcoin, Ether, Litecoin, and other altcoins belong to the same class of financial assets,
which is cryptocurrency. There's a good chance that when something happens that concerns or
can affect the whole cryptocurrency industry, the prices of all your cryptocurrencies may
simultaneously take serious hits. For example, if the Federal Reserve makes a pronouncement
that will make it more difficult to transfer funds from banks to cryptocurrency exchanges, it
won't just be the price of your Bitcoin that will go down. But if you also diversify your
investments to other financial assets, you reduce the potential impact of negative events on your
total portfolio.
Cost Averaging
This is a very useful hodling strategy that can help you earn good returns despite substantial
price drops in the cryptocurrencies in your portfolio. So how does cost-averaging work?
Cost averaging refers to a method of investing by which you buy more units of a financial asset
(cryptocurrencies, bonds, stocks, etc.) when prices go down. You may be thinking: "Why the
heck would I buy more units of a financial asset whose prices are going down?" That's a good
question, one that I'm inclined to answer.
The principle behind cost averaging is this: by buying more units of a financial asset when its
price goes down, you bring down your average initial cost per unit of that financial asset. So
what's the significance of this? If your average cost goes down, your breakeven price for that
financial asset goes down as well. That means you don't have to wait for the price of that
financial asset to fully recover just to break even. And if the price eventually goes back to the
same one at which you originally bought it, you won't just break-even but make a profit already!
Allow me to illustrate with a practical example. If you bought 1 Bitcoin at $10,000 and its price
plunges to $6,000 afterwards, you would've suffered a $4,000 or 40% loss on your investment.
For you to break-even, the price of Bitcoin has to fully recover back to $10,000. And for you to
make a profit, you'll have to wait until Bitcoin goes above $10,000 per unit.
Now let's see what can happen if you employ the cost averaging strategy. Say you bought
another unit of Bitcoin when its price dropped to $6,000. Now, you have 2 Bitcoins for a total
investment of $16,000 ($10,000 + $6,000). By using simple averaging, your average cost of
buying per unit of Bitcoin is $8,000 ($16,000 ÷ 2 Bitcoins). Now, you only need to wait until
the price of Bitcoin goes up to $8,000 to breakeven, compared to waiting for the price to go back
up to $10,000 to break-even when you only owned 1 unit of Bitcoin. And when it goes back up
to $10,000 per Bitcoin, you would've made a profit of $2,000 per Bitcoin or a total of $4,000 for
your total investment. If you didn't cost average, you'd have to wait until the price of Bitcoin had
gone up to $14,000 per Bitcoin just to register a $4,000 profit.
Conclusion
There's no denying that the next frontier in the evolution of the world's financial systems is
Bitcoin and other major altcoins like Ethereum, Litecoin, Ripple and Monero. As such, good
quality ICOs also have a bright future in the world of digital finance. But being able to
successfully hodl and take advantage of the opportunities that cryptocurrencies - both existing
and those that'll be issued in the future - require smart work and a whole lot of self-discipline.
To the extent you can work smart and control yourself, especially your emotions is the extent
you can successfully make money by HODLing Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.
To recap, HODLing refers to holding or keeping cryptocurrencies and that this word is a
mistyped version of the word "hold" which has grown to be an accepted term in the
cryptocurrency community. HODL is also a long-term approach to investing, which is can also
be called as a buy-and-hold approach. To successfully HODL, there are two phases you need to
get right: the pre-HODL phase and the actual HODLing phase.
The pre-HODL phase is when you prepare for taking positions in cryptocurrencies by knowing
your investment goals or purposes, establishing your minimum acceptable rate of return,
estimating the amount of risk you can take, and reading the damn white papers of ICOs, if you're
looking to buy new tokens or coins. The actual HODLing phase involves choosing the optimal
cryptocurrency based on the minimum expected range of returns, diversification, and cost
averaging.
Before we proceed with the basic concepts of cryptocurrency mining, I would like to thank you
all for showing an interest in downloading my book. I have always been fascinated with this
modern-day financial system. I believe that anyone who has invested his/her time and money in
this book is one part interested in this new form of encrypted exchange, one part skeptic,
uncertain and dubious about this concept.
There is nothing wrong with showing doubt and being a little negative about something that we
do not know. I know I was negative once. Terms like Bitcoins, ICOs, blockchains,
cryptocurrencies, whatnot – they are all new for us, and we have every right to know about their
history, workability, advantages, and anything in between.
Thus, in this book, I am going to get you acquainted with cryptocurrency terminology, as well as
give you a brief explanation of how it operates and pays an investor. Does it have any potential?
Yes, it does, but certain aspects make it follow a discreet environment.
Firstly, let us understand how we can define Cryptocurrency.
A cryptocurrency is defined as an asset fabricated to operate as a way of exchange carried out
digitally. It implements a protective technology known as cryptography, which regulates the
generation of more credit units and monitors their transfer between parties.
Simply put, cryptocurrencies are a form of currency in the digital world that do not follow the
rules and regulations of a centralized banking system. Transactions work through a decentralized
database called blockchain, which we will examine in detail in later chapters.
Bitcoin, which emerged as the first cryptocurrency in 2009, has gained worldwide fame over the
years. It was Satoshi Nakamoto, a pseudonym used by an individual or a group, who developed
Bitcoin as the first cryptocurrency. Also, they were the ones to fabricate the beginning of a
blockchain database.
Since then, numerous decentralized cryptocurrencies have revamped the operations of the
traditional financial system. Bitcoins and alternate cryptocurrencies (also known as altcoins) are
already witnessing tremendous growth, making them a part of new technology in the financial
world.
With the digital era evolving to new levels, Bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies are likely to
grow exponentially in the future. With benefits that offer multi-operational utility in the financial
sectors, cryptocurrencies are developing an open system that will allow us to exchange credits in
ways that no one thought possible.
Thus, it is even more significant that you learn about this digital phenomenon and familiarize
yourself with how it works to secure your financial assets.
Chapter 1: History Of Bitcoin Mining
In simple terms, Bitcoin mining is a method of calculating the value of cryptocurrency assets
through a cryptographic process. These processes mine Bitcoins in blocks, which are simply
ledger files that permanently record all recent cryptocurrency transactions.
You should know that the size of the block decreases as the number of coins increase. Any block
starts with 50 BTC (Bitcoin currency symbol), and as the number of blocks reaches 210,000, it
halves. This results in a recurrent halving of the rewards for an individual block. This process is
performed so that the inflation rate is regulated. Otherwise, there would be an uncontrollable
number of paper currencies printing every second.
This concept in itself is proof that mining is not a simple process. It needs investments in the
form of power, time, and computations. Also, with an increase in the time of mining these coins,
its comprehensive power also increases.
Another fact to note is that the speed of emerging Bitcoins is inversely proportional and drops
exponentially. Satoshi calculated the number to be approximately 21,000,000, which can never
be exceeded. Let us explain this mathematically:
A block takes around 10 minutes to be mined. And a complete mining cycle halves every four
years. So, it results in:
Six blocks per hour. Multiply it further by 24 (hours per day), 365 (days per year), and 4
(number of years in a blockchain cycle).
So, we get -> 6 x 24 x 365 x 4 = 210,240 ~ 210,000.
After every 210,000 the block size is halved, and each block has 50 Bitcoins.
So, sum of all the sizes of block rewards becomes:
50 + 25 + 12.5 + 6.25 + 3.125 + … = 100
So, total number of coins that can be mined:
210,000 x 100 = 21,000,000.
If we talk about it in economic terms, the currency is divisible infinitely. Thus, the accurate value
of cryptocurrency coins can be ignored as long as we fix a limit, which is 21 million. No doubt
there can be a time when the number of mined coins reaches 21 million, and there is no more
profit left unless there is a way to redefine the computations and new regulations are determined.
But, that can take a while. Let us learn why.
The annual consumption of energy for mining Bitcoins has been estimated at 30TWh, which is
equal to the stable energy of 114 megawatts for a whole year. Also, an individual transaction of a
Bitcoin can take up power used for providing energy to about 10 U.S. houses in one day. Indeed,
we can see that the energy consumption expenses for mining Bitcoins are high.
Also, if the expenses of the mined coins surpass the costs of equipment and electricity used for
mining, the cost-effective and less competent equipment will no longer be needed for this
industry. This activity is economically reasonable, as increasing in the mining activities will
increase investment in challenging computations, which in itself becomes expensive. In fact, the
difficulty in computations has escalated to some 210,000,000,000 times. Also, the overall mining
capacity for computations has reached 1,500,000,000 hashes per second.
How It All Got Started
Cpu Mining
Bitcoin mining started with earlier servers that let users utilize personal CPUs for mining. The
first block header hash (a secure linkage between previous and current block) was computed
using a conventional CPU of a computer, the Intel Core i7 990x to be precise, which was
efficient enough to calculate at 33 MH/s.
Gpu Mining And The Starting Of Mining Farms
As time went by, the cryptographic mining industry upgraded its processing system to graphics
processing units (GPUs). These adapters were able to perform cryptographic computations at a
much faster rate than CPUs. The higher models of GPUs were able to calculate at 675 MH/s.
Moreover, it was deduced that the calculative abilities could be even faster if one combined the
power of more than one GPU. This linking of GPUs to mine cryptocurrency is termed as a Mini
Farm, which contained a RAM unit, a CPU, 5-6 potent GPU accelerators, and a motherboard.
Gate Arrays
No doubt the disadvantage in initial mining was the requirement of a very powerful system. To
tackle this weak link in the mining farms, a technology called Field-programmable gate array, or
FPGA, was introduced. An FPGA is an IC (integrated circuit) that is configurable by the
designer or customer once it is manufactured.
FPGA miners were evaluated to be five times more efficient compared to GPU miners.
Regarding hash period, an FPGA computation displayed efficiency levels of 25.2 GH/s.
However, there was still the overwhelming costs incurred while using FPGA mining processes.
GPU units were still less expensive and had a better resale value once exhausted.
ASIC Mining
After the advent of the mining farms, it was found that the previous methods became
economically impractical, as they were not specifically designed to run mining computations.
This is where application-specific circuit miners or ASIC miners came into existence, which only
served the purpose of cryptographic mining. These miners are almost ten times more efficient in
mining.
One of the leading designers of ASIC miners was Butterfly Labs, which started developing
miners in 2012 on pre-orders for potential customers. One of their masterpieces is the SC Mini
Rig, which has the computation energy of 1,500 GH/s.
As mining became more and more difficult, it was almost impossible to manage computations
using mini-farms. Lack of resources ultimately led to the migration of the mining technology to
data centers, which were highly efficient in their calculative power. True Bitcoin mining farms
are justified using such setups with massive data centers to support the activity.
Cloud Mining
While ASIC mining using data centers is running currently, there is a new method of mining,
thanks to the emergence of cloud computing technology. We call it cloud mining, which
implements cloud-driven services for mining cryptocurrency. The cloud was able to save costs
on expensive tools and equipment, and electricity, so the technology was favorably included in
the mining process. This solved many problems that data centers usually involve, yet it is not
100% financially efficient. Almost 80% of cloud mining services present today are frauds, and
many mining services do not pay the revenue after investment. So, this type of mining service
needs to be approached very cautiously.
Hack Mining
Another emerging mining concept is hack mining. This is carried out using smart devices owned
by other users. This mining activity is carried out using a special malware software which hacks
into a device without the user being aware of it. After penetrating the device, they discreetly
mine using the hacked system. Many users purchase such shady services, which do not cost
much.
As a lot of power is needed to mine a cryptocurrency coin, a hacker hacks multiple smart
devices, and combines the power of the activity. This way, the owner of the smart device does
not even notice any changes. A case in 2014 emerged, where an anonymous attacker exploited a
limitation in the cloud servers of Synology to mine around $200,000 worth of Dogecoins. More
cases emerged, targeting mobile devices in their millions to mine cryptocurrency since the
existence of this concept.
Hack mining activities are usually successful as hackers can read the software codes better than
the security teams of the manufacturers. They tend to locate the vulnerabilities in their systems
and exploit them for their advantages. Therefore, beware, as you may never know that your
computer system is also helping a miner get rich.
Chapter 2: How It Works
By now, you know that in approximately every 10 minutes, new batches of cryptocurrency coins
are made, with an individual coin worth $8000+ at current value.
Before I proceed with explaining how it works, let me first make you understand how it does not
work. Firstly, do not get the wrong idea that cryptocurrency mining involves using equipment to
search through the depths of the internet to locate a digital ore that can be mined into Bitcoins.
There is no actual ore, and Bitcoins are not about smelting or extracting that ore from the virtual
world.
It has been called mining because the individuals who get new Bitcoins earn it in small and finite
quantities periodically, similar to gold. Thus, the process has been termed as mining, and you are
already aware of the halving system of the Bitcoin batch in an interval of every four years.
Now, to learn how it works, you should know that all Bitcoin miners are doing is comprehensive
bookkeeping. A huge public ledger contains all the records of the transactions carried out in the
world of cryptocurrency until the present. Any transaction of Bitcoins between two parties has to
be recorded and accredited by the miners in the virtual ledger.
It is the miner’s responsibility to monitor that the sender is transacting actual money for mining
the Bitcoin. Once the transfer of money is approved, the miners validate it in the ledger.
Moreover, to make sure that potential attackers do not hack the ledger, the ledger is encrypted
with very complex computations that are almost impossible to hack. This service of mining
offers them Bitcoins.
There is always a competition going on amongst miners, who look forward to approving their
batch of transactions to complete the computations needed to encrypt the transactions in the
public ledger. Every new batch results in a rewarding activity for the miners who completed the
transaction.
However, the computation process is quite daunting. Specialized equipment with hi-tech
processing units are responsible for computing and solving cryptographic problems.
It all does seem exhilarating, doesn’t it? After all, the process of mining has generated a robust
solution to a tough problem that every digital currency faces, which is double spending.
The Concept Of Double Spending
What Is Double Spending?
Double spending can be defined as an activity when an individual transacts more money than the
required amount. Most currencies online face this issue. Traditional currencies keep check on
such problems by paying real cash or acquiring the help of reputed third-party organizations like
banks, credit card services, PayPal, etc., which all transact the amount and record the changes in
the account balances based on the transactions.
However, Bitcoin functions in an open digital world, where third-party organizations do not
influence or monitor it. Its philosophy counters the traditional approach we witness in the
financial world. Thus, if I say to you that I have 20 Bitcoins with me, how will you come to
know that I am not lying about it?
Thus, to keep everything in check, a public ledger was fabricated that records all the transactions.
This public ledger is referred to as Block Chain. I will discuss it in detail in later chapters. This
public ledger lets you trace all the Bitcoin transactions right from the very first time they were
recorded.
But Bitcoin is a digital currency, and is not monitored by any intermediaries. This technology’s
philosophy counters the monitoring activities practiced by third party enterprises. So, if you say
that you own 25 Bitcoins, how will I trust that you are being honest or not? The solution is that
public ledger with records of all transactions, known as the blockchain. (We will learn about it
later.) There is no way you can lie about the number of coins in your possession, when this
technology fabricates a way to trace every transaction right from the start.
Thus, for every Bitcoin transaction, miners go through the ledger and check for malicious
practices of double spending. If everything is found perfect, the transaction is validated and
recorded in the public ledger. It sounds simple, but it is not.
A public ledger accompanies a few problems:
Privacy is the first issue. How can one make sure that the exchange of Bitcoins retains
transparency while not disclosing their identity?
The other problem is security. If we talk about a public ledger that is open for all, how is it
possible to prevent people from using it for their capital exploitations?
Well, to answer these issues, first you should know that a Bitcoin miner does not own an account
in which to keep his/her Bitcoins.
Now coming to privacy, the cryptocurrency ledger manages to overcome the issue of privacy by
using a deceptive technique. This ledger functions as a record keeper for the transactions only. It
does not keep a record of the Bitcoin balance or account. This way, all user information remains
discreet.
Let me explain how it works with an example:
Let us assume that Rick needs to transfer a Bitcoin to Morty. To accomplish this, Morty will
generate an address virtually so that Rick can transact money, including an encryption key, to
that address. The process is similar to an account with a password. The only difference is that
Morty (the receiver) will open a new virtual address and a key for every new transaction. It is not
necessary to do so, but to keep everything secure it is recommended that the transaction is done
like this.
Now, when Rick clicks the send button to transact the money to Morty, the transaction chances
into an encrypted code containing the amount and Morty’s virtual address. This transaction is
also transferred to all Bitcoin miners on the internet, which includes all computers running the
software for mining. Once the miners figure out that the transaction is authentic, it gets validated
and recorded to the ledger. Let us conclude that the ledger authenticated and recorded the
transaction.
Now, let us assume that Morty wants to send one Bitcoin to Jeremy. So, Jeremy validates a
virtual address and an encryption key. Morty eventually transacts the Bitcoin by using the key
and address that Rick gave him, and sends it to Jeremy.
Just like before, the transaction is sent to all the miners for validation. The miners evaluate the
transaction via a reference number that points to the previous transaction from Rick to Morty.
This is to ensure that Morty did not make any other transactions after that, which we call Double
Spending. After the transaction is authenticated, every miner sends and receives a message of
validation from every other miner. Similarly, the transactions for Morty and Jeremy are also
validated for track keeping in the ledger.
This is how transactions in the Bitcoin world work. People transferring Bitcoins (or Bitcoin
fractions) to one another. The ledger keeping track of the Bitcoins, but not the people or their
balances. As a user creates a new key and address every time, the ledger will not be able to
identify him/her, his/her addresses, or the number of coins he/she possesses. Thus, we define it
as a transaction record that moves from one anonymous user to another.
Now, moving towards a solution for security:
The primary step that Bitcoin currency takes for securing the public ledger is decentralizing it.
There is no sign of a master document or a large spreadsheet secured on a server. Instead, the
public ledger is divided into chunks of blocks, which are hidden logs of transaction that contain
Bitcoins in batches. Plus, every new block accompanies a reference to its previous block. This
way, a user can follow the reference links and locate the very first one, when Satoshi Nakamoto
designed this whole concept and Bitcoins were born.
We refer to this long chain of blocks as blockchain, which incorporates the public ledger for
Bitcoins. As mentioned in previous chapters, each new block takes 10 minutes to mine,
expanding it into a long chain over time.
You should know that every miner of Bitcoins possesses a copy of the complete blockchain on
his/her computer. If the user/miner switches off his/her computer for some time and then powers
it on once again, his/her computer sends a message to all other miners requesting they share all
the blocks that were created during this period of inactivity. Therefore, there are no special
privileges given to any particular miner or computer. Also, no specific miner keeps a record of
all the updates related to the blockchain. The information is held in check by the numerous
miners, publicly.
Factors That Influence Mining
As the activity of mining is intricate, it is prudent that you choose the right hardware. One has to
keep in mind specific factors that affect the overall performance of a Bitcoin mining process. Let
us discuss each factor.
Hash Rate:
Hash rate can be defined as the number of calculations performed by the hardware in one second.
This rate is of high significance, as the higher the hash rate number, the faster the calculations,
which will close the block and reward you much quicker.
Miners keep a look-out for a particular output from the hash function. For the hash functions, the
same output is generated for the same input, yet they have been fabricated to show erratic
behavior. Thus, miners try several random inputs to find a particular output for the hash function.
You should understand that the competition in mining is robust, so to obtain a reward, a miner
needs to search through all the random inputs as fast as possible. Thus, a higher hash rate
facilitates faster search output – thus increasing the probability of being rewarded.
To measure hash rates, we use the unit MH/s (megahashes per second), GH/s (gigahashes per
second), and TH/s (terahashes per second). You may have already seen these units displayed
above, but now you understand their importance. Furthermore, a hardware’s hash rate is
particularly fabricated for Bitcoin mining, which can range from 336 MH/s to 14 million MH/s.
Consumption Of Energy:
The next factor of importance in Bitcoin mining is the investment in power input. Powerful
hardware that you are planning to use for computations is going to need a convenient supply of
electricity (energy). Before proceeding, you will need to understand the energy consumption of
the hardware in watts. Plus, you will have to calculate your electricity bill as per the predicted
number of watts. This calculation will help you to anticipate whether your investment in mining
Bitcoins is less than the rewards you are going to earn or not.
Utilizing the consumption of energy and hash rate in numbers will help you figure out the
number of hashes that you receive for each watt expended by your hardware. For achieving the
numbers, you can divide the hash rate by the watts.
Here is an example:
Assume that the hash rate of your hardware is 4,000 MH/s with a requirement of 30 watts, so the
consumption of energy will be 133,333 MH/s per watt. You can even use an electricity rate
calculator online, or simply check your electricity bill to know the actual cost of your investment
in the power supply for your hardware.
Hardware:
At one time, the concept of Bitcoin was too good to be true. People from a multitude of regions
and cultures were attracted to this financial technology that offered freedom. There was no role
of a centralized network, which relaxed users. Now, they had the power to check their
transactions through an autonomous system that did not function through corporations, tax
authorities, banks, and other third-party organizations. There is no one to keep an eye on how
one spent his/her own money.
Moreover, in the past few years, the value of Bitcoin was not motivated by mere profit, but was
admired due to the unique concept and philosophy it followed. Back then, computers were all
that were needed to transact and calculate the exchange of Bitcoins.
As technology advanced, miners found that better GPU processors were able to calculate and
mine Bitcoins at a faster rate. In fact, the results were almost 100 times more efficient than
previously. Thus, mining hardware manufacturers came into existence, and they started
designing hardware specifically for this purpose. This conclusively gave birth to the concept of
cryptocurrency mining.
Nowadays, mining Bitcoins has become quite profitable. Many are even paying their regular
bills through the rewards generated using mining of Bitcoins. The mining farms consist of
graphic card processors and cooling units to keep the computation running continuously.
Apparently, a mining farm will require a vast supply of power, which is not usually available to
individual miners. Thus, the big corporations invest in the energy utilization and virtually gather
limitless resources to create mining farms. However, there is still a way for individual miners to
make a profit. And that is by joining with other miners and combining their power. This is
known as a mining pool.
Proof Of Work
You should also be familiar with the phenomenon ‘proof of work’ in the mining industry. A
Proof of Work is a part of data that is quite time-consuming, costly and difficult to produce. It is
needed for acknowledging particular needs. However, it has to be more streamlined to check
whether it satisfies the specific requirements or not.
Production of a POW can be formulated randomly with reduced probability. Lowering the
probability results in more chances of trial and error, which is essential to validate before
generating a proof of work. Bitcoin uses a hash cash proof of work system, in particular.
The hash cash method used in Bitcoin mining helps reduce spam emails, as the sender will have
to provide a valid proof of work in the contents of the email, including the To address.
Any legit email can show the proof without any difficulties. On the contrary, spam emails will
not be able to do so, as there is a need for computations for generating the proof.
In Bitcoin system, the hash cash proof of work generates blocks. This proof of work is attached
to an individual block’s data so that it can be validated. Its difficulty is also regulated so that
there is a limit on the generation of new blocks. Thus, each block generation takes roughly 10
minutes.
Moreover, as the probability is set at a low value, the success of a generation of proof of work
becomes unpredictable, as there is little information about the particular computer that will be
generating the successive block.
Also, there is a requirement for validating a block, which is based on a lower hash value than the
present target. In other words, every block that generates consists of the hash value from the
previous block. This results in the chain of blocks that together incorporate a lot of
computational work to produce Proof of Work.
Furthermore, altering a block will require reworking on all the following blocks. This way the
blockchain remains safe from being tampered with.
The Difficulty Of Bitcoin/Crypto Mining
What Is Mining Difficulty?
Mining difficulty is defined as the measure of how hard it is to locate a hash under a given target
value during the POW (proof of work).
Why Is Mining A Bitcoin Block Difficult?
Mining a Bitcoin block is difficult as accepting a block is only possible if its target is greater or
equal in value to the SHA-256 hash of a block header.
In simple terms: Every block hash initiates with a specific cluster of zeros. With so many zeros,
there is a very low probability of computation of a block hash. This results in many trials before
generating a hash. For generating a new hash, the hash cash function used in Bitcoin mining
increases.
The Metrics Of Bitcoin Network Difficulty
This network difficulty in Bitcoin mining is a comparison between the instance it takes to
identify a difficult block and the easiest block. After every 2016 blocks, this measure is
recalibrated to such a value that the 2016 blocks from the previous cycle would have emerged in
two weeks’ time if all miners were generating at the same difficulty. This way, each block
generates every 10 minutes.
With more miners adding up, the block generation rate also increases. This will also raise the
difficulty of a generation so that it can balance the increasing rate of block generation and push it
back down. Furthermore, attempts to add fraud blocks by exploiters are straightaway declined by
all miners in the Bitcoin network, so it is futile.
The Reward For Block Discovery
On discovery of a block, the user gets a particular number of Bitcoins as a reward. This reward is
given to him/her after consent from all other miners in the network. At present, the reward
compensation is set to 25 Bitcoins, whose value will be halved after the generation of 210,000
blocks.
Also, the users who carried out the transaction also compensate the Bitcoin miner with a certain
amount. This compensation is given so that the miner can add the transaction to the block. Thus,
as more Bitcoin miners join, the value of Bitcoin is likely to decay. Then, the compensation fees
for adding a transaction is likely to be of high significance for generating an income through
mining.
Chapter 3: What Is A Block Chain?
A blockchain functions as an open-source ledger where users record, control, and amend
transactions. The blockchain is no different from other platforms, say for instance Wikipedia.
Just as Wikipedia is an open source platform where a single publisher is not responsible for
fabricating content, blockchain too does not give full power to just one miner.
However, as we move towards a deeper level, we find that Wikipedia is running on the internet
through a client-server model of a network. Here, users are first provided with permissions to
amend content in the website’s pages that are all stored on an integrated server.
So, a user accessing the page on the website will be provided with an updated version of the
original copy for any particular entry on Wikipedia. Also, the regulation of the whole database
system stays with the administrators, who are granted permissions and access through the main
authority at the center.
Wikipedia’s system operates similarly to the databases of other centralized and secured systems
like insurance companies, government, or banks. So, in such cases, there is a primary owner who
has the authority to manage, protect, and access any update to the system against malicious
activities.
However, the distribution system and the database involved with the blockchain technology are
quite distinct. While Wikipedia’s original copy is amended on the server, which is not visible to
the users (clients), the blockchain offers updates independently. Every update to the system is
done on the master copy, which is visible to all users.
This difference makes it very useful, as this method eliminates the requirement of third-party
organizations for digital affiliation. However, we cannot consider blockchain technology as new.
On the contrary, it can be termed as a modern combination of innovation and proven methods. In
other words, it came into existence because of three technologies: a protocol to incentivize,
cryptography with an encrypted key, and the internet. And Satoshi figured out this concept and
changed it into a billion-dollar industry.
Thus, the blockchain technology prevented centralizing the system as building and securing
digital relationships is absolute. Here all digital transactions are supplied using a robust, elegant
and straightforward network framework that works as a peer-to-peer system.
Building Digital Trust
Maintaining trust in the digital world is often linked to authorization and identification. In simple
terms, people online would like to know whether the person on the other end identifies himself
honestly and if he can complete the job he claims.
The blockchain system offers a secure tool of ownership that completes all necessary
authentication criteria. The encryption key is enough to identify the authenticity of the owner.
Thus, there is no need to share detailed personal information that would otherwise have created
the opportunity for hackers to attack.
Nevertheless, the relationship cannot be only based on authentication. There is also a need for
enough money, authorization, correct address, transaction type, etc., which all requires
distribution to balance it out in the overall network. This distribution strategy decreases the
chances of forming a centralized body that would otherwise promote failure and corruption.
Furthermore, the distributed network should commit to security and recordkeeping. So, any
authorization of a transaction will result in permission from the entire spread-out network.
Authorization and authentication, when carried out like this, allows the relationships to generate
without the need for expensive investments. In fact, modern-world entrepreneurs have risen to
indications of this technology, which is influential, innovative, and inconceivable. The
blockchain technology has evolved as the base for all transactions carried out in the digital
world, where it is building stronger digital relationships.
Chapter 4: How To Get Started
Now, I hope that you understand the basic terms related to the cryptocurrency mining industry. It
is time to learn the actual steps for starting with the process.
Firstly, one should know that mining Bitcoins in the current climate would be too expensive. If
you had initiated mining Bitcoins in the year 2009, when it started, you could easily generate
tons of dollars. But, it is also true that you could have lost plenty of money. I would not
recommend beginners who are planning on starting small to invest in Bitcoins. The level of
maintenance expenses and investment needed, accompanied by the computational difficulty in
the process, is not lucrative at standard-level hardware. Bitcoins are not more appealing to largescale industries who have hundreds and thousands of dollars to spare in the process.
However, we do have alternative cryptocurrencies, like Feathercoins, Dogecoins, and Litecoins,
that provide benefits at a much-budgeted level for beginners. Anyone interested in mining any of
these altcoins can generate up to 10 dollars every day using the usual consumer-level mining
hardware.
Here is how you set up a mining process for any of these coins.
Steps To Start Mining Altcoins
1. Set up a coin wallet, which is a private database, free to use. It is like a digital Piggy bank that is protected with a
password to keep your earnings secure. It also stores the open network ledger used for recording the transactions.
2. A software package (usually free), which is usually made of open sources and pool mining regulatory platforms, like
stratum and cgminer.
3. Online mining pool membership, where miners have built a community to combine their computers and increase their
power, hence profits.
4. Authorization at some currency exchange online, where you can trade your earned coins for traditional cash.
5. Continuous and fast internet connection. At least 2 Mbps is needed.
6. An air-conditioned part of your home where the hardware will be set up.
7. A customized desktop created explicitly for mining. Your standard computer may not be used, as you will need to
keep running the system for mining. Also, your laptop, handheld device, or gaming console will not be of any use as
these units are not able to generate enough computations for earning profits.
8. A GPU unit or an ASIC chip, which is a processing device used for mining. It can cost from $90-$3000 for either of
these two units.
9. A cooling fan to keep the mining system cool at all times. A lot of heat generates while mining, which is why a
cooling device is needed for a successful mining process.
10. Staying updated with the technological changes in the mining industry is also a requirement. New techniques and
amendments are continually happening in this industry, so you will have to be aware of them to be a successful miner.
Now, if you still want to dedicate your time to stepping into the big leagues and mine Bitcoins,
then the following method will be of use to you.
Steps To Mining Bitcoins In Particular
Step 1: Buying Hardware
Currently, the best Bitcoin mining hardware for miners is the ASIC mining hardware. These
machines work at solid computational speeds while keeping the consumption of power lower
than GPU or FPGA mining systems. Many reputed companies have already manufactured great
ASIC rigs for users worldwide.
ASIC systems serve the sole purpose of solving Bitcoin blocks. With the increase in the
popularity of Bitcoins, their price also inflates. This triggers the rise in price of the ASIC mining
hardware. For maintaining balance of cryptocurrency generation, its difficulty in mining inflates.
Thus, it becomes almost impossible to beat the system without a decent ASIC machine to
support the process.
Also, the ASIC technology used for Bitcoin mining is improving its productivity, efficiency, and
speed with time, so that it can be considered the best hardware for mining.
Some popular mining hardware is AntMiner S5, AntMiner S7, AntMiner S9, Antminer U3, USB
miners, VMC Platinum 6, BTC Garden AM-V1, Avalon 3, Avalon 6, Avalon 2, Asic Miner BE
Prisma, and ASICMiner BE Tube.
Do note that current prices may vary, so have a look at each set of hardware before deciding
which one to choose.
Step 2: Choosing A Bitcoin Mining Software
Now that you are aware of decent hardware for mining Bitcoins, let us move on to the software.
What Is Mining Software?
Even though the mining hardware for Bitcoins takes care of the real process for mining, mining
software is also of high significance.
For individual miners, the software does the work of linking the blockchain network to
the miner.
For pool miners, the software tends to link the individual miner to the pool of miners.
However, for cloud miners, there is no need for software to mine.
The Significance Of Mining Software For Bitcoin
The primary work of mining software is to transfer the computed work of the mining hardware to
the distributed network on the blockchain. It also receives back all the completed and validated
work from the rest of the miners present on the blockchain network.
With Bitcoin mining software, the input and output operations of the miner are all monitored.
Also, the crypto-mining software displays the temperature, fan speed, hash rate, miner speed, and
similar statistical values.
Bitcoin Wallet
I mentioned a cryptocurrency wallet in the previous sections of the chapter. Well, a Bitcoin
wallet also plays a significant role in keeping a check on transactions, etc. Moreover, a miner
will need to have a legit Bitcoin wallet before moving on to the software part. It happens because
the software will request a valid Bitcoin address to send and receive payouts and rewards. Once
you download or generate a wallet, you will be able to create a Bitcoin address.
You can find many Bitcoin wallets available online. Here are a few wallets, if you are confused
about which to choose.
BreadWallet: A popular Bitcoin wallet for iOS users.
Mycelium: Android users love this Bitcoin wallet.
Electrum: This Bitcoin wallet is suitable for Linux, Windows, and Mac.
Ledger Nano S: Simple and secure hardware wallet suitable for all platforms.
You may have noticed that the Ledge Nano S is specified as a hardware wallet. This particular
wallet is the most secure type of Bitcoin wallet, and is suitable for miners who earn a
considerable amount of money through the process of mining. We will learn about it later in this
guide. Now, let us move on to more about the Bitcoin software.
Some Recommendations To Get You Started
Mining Software For Windows
1. Bitcoin Miner
This mining software is excellent for using on Windows 8.1 and Windows 10. It provides a userfriendly interface with quick-sharing, mining pool, and power saving features. It also offers a
feature called profit reports, which will predict whether your mining process is going to be
lucrative or not.
2. BTCMiner
This open source miner for Bitcoins is popularly used for ZTEX USB-FPGA modules. Looking
at its features, the BTCMiner boasts a frequency scaling mode that autonomously selects the
most dynamic frequency for the hashes with the highest rate. Furthermore, it is a ready-to-use
software where there is no need for a license. It also accompanies FPGA boards that support it
through a USB interface for programming and communication.
3. CGMiner
Any miner comes across this software in the mining activity, as it is arguably the most common
of all among miners. It has been designed using the original programming algorithms of CPU
Miner. A few of its many features are:
• Support for CPU mining
• Support for multiple GPUs
• Self-detection protocol for finding new blocks, including a mini database
• Interface capabilities that are located remotely
• Regulated fan speed
4. BFGMiner
It resembles CGMiner in operations. However, unlike CGMiner, it has been built specially for
ASIC rigs and not for GPUs. A few other features of this software are:
• Fan regulation
• Combined overclocking power
• ADL reordering device by PCI-based bus ID
• Free mining with LLVM Open Cl/ mesa
5. EasyMiner
This is a graphics user interface-based software that encases other software like BFGMiner and
CGMiner to make it more efficient. It supports both stratum protocol for mining as well as
getwork protocol for mining. Plus, it is efficient for both individual and pool-based mining. Its
main features comprise of delivering excellent graphs for monitoring performance through
simple visualizations, and it provides with miner configuration.
Mining Software For Linux OS
1. CGMiner
Just like for the Windows platform, CGMiner is a popular and standard mining software that
most miners prefer to mine Bitcoins. CGMiner reflects the standards of the original
programming algos used in CPU Miner. The features for this software are the same as the ones
mentioned in the Windows platform section.
2. BFGMiner
See information about it in the Windows OS section.
3. EasyMiner
See features in the Windows mining software section.
Mining Software For The Mac OSX Platform
1. RPC Miner
RPC Miner shows feasible compatibility with Mac OS of versions 10.6 or higher. It offers
combination features with systems and APIs based on MAC OS.
2. Cash Out your Coins
This particular software will require a miner to cash out some Bitcoins to pay for the energy
consumption, such as electricity.
Besides these, the Mac OS platform can run any of the software discussed in the previous
platforms. So, you can read about them from previous sections. You can choose the software for
beginning your mining activity by comparing their features and other requirements.
Step 3: Joining A “Mining Pool”
In previous chapters, I mentioned the term mining pools but never got the chance to elaborate
upon them appropriately. Thus, let me explain the concept briefly.
Mining pools are parties created by miners to work and mine Bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies
together. Thus, their combined power results in sharing the rewards based on the hash rate
contributed by all miners. For an individual miner, it will be tough to find blocks, unless that
particular miner is filthy rich to set up a super powerful mining farm. So, to increase the
probability of finding blocks, miners mine together to achieve results at a much faster rate.
So, your most feasible step to mine Bitcoins is by joining a mining pool.
How Are You Rewarded In A Mining Pool?
It depends on the speed of generating hash rates. Hash rates are directly proportional to the
chances of finding a new block, which in turn will bring out better rewards. Do note that each
mining pool website that you are planning to join will ask for a particular pooling fee. So, expect
to pay that as well.
Which Countries Are Mining The Most Coins?
Bitcoin mining gives more weight to countries with cheap energy consumption, such as
electricity. Apparently, this has led to the centralization of the mining industries to only 10 to 15
major mining companies, which have taken over a considerable amount of hash power present in
the blockchain network.
As most of the companies are concentrated in a few countries, only these few countries mine and
export Bitcoins. Here is an insight into the major ones:
China
China is the leading miner of most of the Bitcoins, and hence acts as the major exporter of
cryptocurrency coins as well. China owns many major pool-mining communities, which have
been estimated to own around 60% of the hash power. This also means that 60% of newly mined
Bitcoins come from China.
Georgia
Georgia is the residence of the famous Bitcoin mining company, BitFury, which not only
controls 15% of the mining activities but is also one of the biggest manufacturers of Bitcoin
chips and mining hardware.
Sweden
Sweden’s Stockholm is where KnCMiner, one of the significant Bitcoin mining players, has
spread its roots. It contributes to 7.5% of the mining of Bitcoins.
U.S.
21 Inc., located in the U.S., is a BTC mining company situated in California. The firm not only
executes a considerable amount of mining activities but also produces and sells low-powered
miners for Bitcoin, which is a product of their 21 Bitcoin computer line. The majority of hash
power generated from the 21 Bitcoin systems targets the mining pool owned by the company.
Their mining power can contribute 3% of the total mining activities.
Rest Of The World
The companies mentioned above take care of 80% of the Bitcoin mining processes. The
remaining 20% is spread out around the rest of the countries.
China’s Mining Pool Concentration
In later sections, I will discuss the best pool mining communities to join. But, before we proceed,
you should know that China is the leading region for major pool mining activities. Also, most
pool websites are in Chinese only. This may be a big issue, as the major part of centralization for
mining is in this country.
This is possible because of the low electricity costs in its region, which has attracted more
mining activity than any other country. Not to mention, China is the major manufacturing hub
and can produce the hardware units needed for computations at a much lower price than other
countries.
It’s rumored that some Chinese power companies point their excess energy towards Bitcoin
mining facilities so that no energy goes to waste. Currently, 20 mining pools stand out as the
most famous ones. Out of these almost 81% of the hash rates from the mining pools are
controlled by Chinese regions.
Top 10 Mining Pool Communities Active At Present
Now let me introduce you to the ten major mining pool communities.
1. Antpool
Located in China, Antpool is the most active pool mining platform, and is currently functioning
under BitMain. Antpool mines around 25% of the blocks.
2. BTC.top
BTC.top is a mining pool community owned privately by its members. It is not accessible to
common miners.
3. BTC.Com
BTC.com is publicly accessible to join for pool mining.
4. Bixin
Bixin is another Chinese pool-mining platform that is publicly available. However, you will need
to speak Chinese here to interact with other miners.
5. BTCC
BTCC boasts itself as China’s third-biggest exchange platform for Bitcoins. Its pool mining
community currently handles about 7% of all available blocks.
6. F2pool
DiscusFish, also referred as F2Pool, is another Chinese platform for pool miners that has
succeeded in finding around 5 to 6% of the blocks in just six months.
7. ViaBTC
ViaBTC is a new mining pool platform, which is focusing more on Chinese miners.
8. BW Pool
BW emerged in China in 2014. It has almost a 5% share of the block mining under its name.
9. Bitclub.Network
Bitclub Network is another platform that has shown results and is quite large. But, there have
been rumors about it being malicious.
10. Slush
Slush Pool has been there since the beginning. It is a trusted platform for beginner miners.
Despite being the first pool mining community, it only racks about 3% of the blocks.
Recommended Pool Mining Community For Beginners
While it feels natural to choose a mining pool platform that has a major share in the activity, it is
not always best practice to do so. I recommend going to Slush Pool mining community, which
has been present since the very start of the pool-mining project. Slush Pool is operated by
Satoshi Labs
The Process Of Joining Slush Pool
Anyone can easily join Slush Pool. All you need to do is:
1. Sign up for an account.
2. Setup configuration for your preferred mining software so that it points the hash power
produced by your hardware to the Slush Pool’s mining platform.
3. Share the address details of your Bitcoin wallet, which will be provided with rewards and
payouts.
List Of Urls Offered By Slush Pool
To be a member of the mining community at Slush, you will have to show your software the way
to the regional URLs offered by the website. This way, you can enhance your mining profits.
Mainland China
stratum+tcp://cn.stratum.slushpool.com:3333stratum+tcp://cn.stratum.slushpool.com:443
Usa (East):

Europe
stratum+tcp://eu.stratum.slushpool.com:3333
Singapore/Asia-Pacific:
stratum+tcp://sg.stratum.slushpool.com:3333
How Much Pooling Fees Does Slush Charge Its Miners?
Slush asks for pooling charge fees of 2% on all rewards and payouts. Slush Pool transparently
organizes its mining pool community with its users. That is why it shares the transaction fees
with individual miners on receipt of rewards.
Slush Pool’s activities are executed under Satoshi Labs. The firm is also responsible for the
creation of a hardware wallet for Bitcoins named Trezor.io, and also owns coinmap.org.
Step 4: Setting Up Your Bitcoin Wallet
By now you know that wallets are your encrypted storehouses that contain all the payouts and
rewards. Now, we are going to look a little deeper into their types.
There are two types of cryptocurrency wallet, which are: Cold or offline wallets and Hot or
online wallets. Let us learn how the two types vary from each other.
The most fundamental difference between the two is that the hot wallets are linked to the online
world, while the cold wallets restrict that connection. Most miners use both types of wallet,
which provide them with varying purposes.
Hot wallets are more like checking accounts that you use more often. On the other hand, a cold
account is like a savings account for keeping all your digital assets safe. Miners usually keep a
small amount of currency in the hot wallets for trading. And a significant amount of their digital
money is stored safely in the cold wallets.
Now, you must be wondering about the security aspects of the two. Let us explore a little more
deeply.
Why Do Miners Keep A Large Sum Of Their Bitcoins In Cold Wallets?
The answer to this is simple. This way the attackers will not be able to steal their digital assets, as
there is no online connection to exploit the wallet.
Does That Mean Hot Wallets Are Not Safe?
For determining how secure a hot wallet is, one will have to study the reputation and behavior of
the third parties and individuals who are connected to the hot wallet. Anything that is linked
online is prone to hacking and attacks. So, miners usually prefer keeping a small amount in their
hot wallets, as an attacker will not waste his/her resources just to get hold of a small amount.
Types Of Hot Wallets
Account-Based Hot Wallets
Accounts that are stored in the online asset exchange companies, such as Bittrex and Poloniex,
are deemed as hot wallets as they record all the funds of a user in their servers and infrastructure.
If an attacker hacks the Poloniex system and drains all the assets stored there, then your account
is most likely to be affected by the attack as well, as Poloniex is holding your funds for you
directly.
A Coinbase account is also a type of hot wallet. So, if Coinbase is attacked, you could lose your
funds too. This is why many practices keeping a small number of their digital assets in Coinbase
and similar hot wallets.
Using Coinbase to trade and exchange Bitcoins is secure, as long as you immediately move the
money out of the wallet once the trade is completed. Many have found Coinbase to be a secure
platform for business. However, it still questions the ethics whether it is fully secure and worth
risking storing huge sums of money in it. I would suggest using Coinbase if you are a beginner
miner, as the firm offers a user-friendly app and website for users, especially in the U.S.
Software-Based Hot Wallets
There is another type of hot wallet, such as Exodus.io, which is software downloadable and
installable on a computer. Another name in the software types of hot wallet is Dash QT wallet. In
this wallet, Exodus does not practice storing the private keys of the miners on the servers. Thus,
the miners control their own money. However, there is still a risk of getting phished, as your
wallet is connected to the internet, which can be a medium for a potential hacker to attack your
computer and gain access to it. Exodus wallets are fabricated to communicate with the various
blockchains directly. It also acknowledges many digital cryptocurrencies, except Bitcoins.
You can consider several factors when choosing a software wallet. Exodus has been a popular
choice among many users because it is user-friendly and has been combined with Shapeshift.
This combined feature lets users avoid migrating to an asset exchange division externally, such
as Poloniex or Bittrex to facilitate trading. With Exodus, miners have the benefit of not leaving
the unsecure system. It surely is a great wallet, but it still needs to update its features to make the
hot wallet more secure for users.
Types Of Cold Wallets
Hardware Wallets
While there are many types of cold wallet, the main one that we will focus on is the hardware
wallet. This wallet has a physical body that is not connected to the internet. However, it does
have a plug-in feature that lets it connect to the internet when required.
These wallets are very secure, as whenever a transaction is made, the wallet asks for
confirmation from the user by instructing him/her to press the button present on it. You can
consider them hack-proof. These encrypted devices are great for storing large sums of assets.
Three popular hardware wallet brands that miners usually choose are: KeepKey, Ledger Nano S,
and Trezor.io.
Each one of these hardware/cold wallets has its unique features. For instance, Trezor.io has an
outstanding reputation, and it was designed at Satoshi Labs. Trezor provides exceptional
customers service and supports a multitude of currencies, namely – Testnet, Dogecoin,
Namecoin, Litecoin, ZCash, Ethereum Classic, Ethereum, Dash, and Bitcoin.
Step 5: Start Mining
By now, we have learned all the beginner-level stuff about Bitcoins and their terminology. Do
note that there is much more to learn in this network of cryptocurrencies, but all the above
information is enough to get you started.
Now that we know which devices, software, and other equipment are needed for mining, it is
time to start the actual mining. This last step is where you will learn about ways to improve your
knowledge and stay updated about Bitcoin mining and news. This currency and all the rules
surrounding it are quite volatile. They tend to change often. Therefore, you will have to try your
best to stay as updated about new techniques, latest news, etc., as you can.
Even though Bitcoin has been considered a risky investment, you cannot deny that the interest in
this digital currency is increasing every day. You read this book until now because you want to
learn about it. You have probably already set up all the accounts and hardware to start with the
mining procedure, but before you continue, you should know that keeping yourself updated with
any new developments in the mining space is of high significance.
Staying Updated
So, as stated earlier, the last step is all about staying updated and mining according to what you
learn from such updates. This is not as simple as it may seem. You will have to dig deep into the
layers of the cryptocurrency world to find information of importance to you in your mining
activity. This can be very time consuming, especially when you do not know where to start.
Fortunately, this book gives you tips on how to proceed with the research work. So, let us
continue.
Learning Through Widgets
My Bitcoins Gadget (For Windows)
With this widget’s aid, you will get to know the number of coins you possess, their current
worth, and it also lets you link to your pool mining community to reveal data and rewards, if any.
Domchi, a member of BitcoinTalk, developed this widget. A new update has also been released
for this widget after the previous update Mt.Gox collapsed. At first glance, the website may look
malicious, but many BitcoinTalk administrators have already tested it and found that it is clean,
simple, and safe to use.
Bitcoin Ticker (For Mac)
For MacBook users, the Bitcoin Ticker performs quite efficiently. This widget stays at the top of
the screen on your Mac OSX and displays the prices of up to seven types of cryptocurrency
exchange.
Learning From Internet Browsing Websites
Here are some popular news websites, which offer Bitcoin news and updates regularly.
Coindesk
This cryptocurrency-related news website stays up-to-date about anything related to Bitcoins and
the cryptocurrency industry. A number of articles are published every day which talk about more
than just recent updates. Many long-form pieces present on this website are worth reading, as
they teach a lot about the world of cryptocurrency, its future, tips to improve mining, etc.
Coindesk is also a great place for beginner miners to start. Their Blockchain 101 has been listed
as a great article for newbies. Here, the most commonly asked questions related to the Bitcoin
world are answered. Besides the cryptocurrency section, readers can also go through their other
sections, which are Data, Research, Business, Markets, and Technology.
Cointelegraph
This site is an independent news platform targetting applications related to decentralization, the
blockchain network, and cryptocurrency. It started in 2013 but has since garnered a massive
audience, making it stand out as the second most visited Bitcoin news website. Cointelegraph
publishes a mixture of cryptocurrency-based commentary, market data & analysis, expert
opinion, and breaking news. Cointelegraph also provides a user-friendly ICO calendar that gives
all updates related to the launch of potential new coins.
Bitcoin Magazine
This magazine is more focused on Bitcoin in particular. The other cryptocurrency coins are
occasionally covered, but a significant part of the website focuses on news updates related to the
first cryptocurrency. This website consists of articles that are divided into five broader classes,
which are: Technical, Opinion, Price & Data, Guides, and News. Each class further divides into
subclasses that provide various topics of interest. So, there is plenty of information on this
website, despite its coverage limited to just Bitcoin. It started in the year 2012 and publishes four
articles every day, currently.
TheMerkle
This website is considered to be the youngest of all the websites on this list, as it was launched in
2014. The site covers the whole cryptocurrency sector, but there is an occasional turn towards
news and reports related to other markets as well. Besides the usual categories of news, you may
also find its review section educational. TheMerkle studies the finest cryptocurrency wallets and
exchanges and reviews them. The site also provides comparisons on various virtual currencies
and other financial equipment of importance. For instance, one of their comparison articles
talked about the difference between stock-driven IPO and crypto-driven ICO. This site updates
with up to 15 articles every day.
CryptoCoinsNews
CCN is a sister website of Hacked, but while the latter targets advice on trading and analyzing
coins, the former is all about providing news coverage. The significant currencies covered in the
news on the website are Ethereum, Litecoin, and Bitcoin. However, there are also updates related
to other alternate coins from time to time as well. The site is more focused on a professional
approach compared to the others on this list. For any reader who wants to study offerings of new
products, changes in price, and mergers, then CCN is the place for you. CCN also offers an
educational portal, just like CoinDesk. Though it may not be as detailed as CoinDesk’s, it still
provides vital information on the crypto sector.
Official Bitcoin Blog
This may be the official Bitcoin blog, but it only updates when there is a major announcement or
news update regarding this currency. The Bitcoin team hardly updates a single post every couple
of months, but when it releases, it gets aggregated coverage from all other news websites
instantly. Nevertheless, if you are into Bitcoins, then you should definitely bookmark this
website for updates. In addition, this is the only official platform that will offer you genuine
updates about these digital coins. You can just add it to your current RSS feed and stay updated.
Bitcoin Talk
Bitcoin Talk is not really a conventional news website, but a forum, and a reputed one, at that.
Over 1.5 million forum members actively operate on this website to cover and share the slightest
update related to the cryptocurrency world. There is also a subclass for every possible section
related to Bitcoins, such as trading updates, mining news, technical discussion, etc. A unique and
helpful section that this website possesses is the Press Hits page, which offers one of the most
broad-scale cluster of news articles for your knowledge. When you scroll down further on the
website, you can also find a little section that dedicates itself to other cryptographic currencies
and coins. Members share and discuss all major updates in that section.
Reddit
Anyone familiar with Reddit already understands the vast cluster of data available on it for
educational, entertainment, and other significant purposes. Subreddits related to Bitcoins and the
cryptocurrency industry are no different. You can find plenty of them available on the website,
which you can join and stay informed. A few of them that will update all major and minor news
related to the crypto sector are /r/CryptoCurrency, /r/Bitcoin, /r/CryptoMarkets, and
/r/BitcoinMarkets. Do visit /r/Bitcoin if Bitcoins are your number one mode of interest in this
industry. Nevertheless, try subscribing to as many subreddits as you desire. You may never know
when you get vital information from any of them.
Learn From Your Mobile Phones And Smart Devices
These mobile applications, which I am going to share below, are great at providing you with
news updates and information on the run. Websites are most suitable when you are at your home
computer or laptop. But apps provide you with a user-friendly layout that can be viewed
whenever you get time. That said, here are a few popular mobile apps to get you updated with
Bitcoin information.
Bitcoin Checker (For Android)
With over 50,000 users and a rating of 4.7 by 3,400+ downloaders, Bitcoin Checkers offers you
information related to the latest cryptocurrency prices. In addition, you can set alarms on this app
that notify you about any major or trivial change in the cryptocurrency market, for which you
can set up specific prerequisites. For instance, the app can notify you with an alarm when there is
a rise or fall in the coin price by a certain amount.
Zeroblock (For Both iPhone And Android)
The ZeroBlock app not only keeps you updated on the real-time market prices, but also the latest
news related to the world of digital currency. In addition, you also get a Bitcoin calculator
incorporated in this application. This app has seen more user following among iPhone owners,
who also use it for staying updated about current prices.
My Recommendations
No doubt, there are many portals from where you can gather Bitcoin information at your
convenience, but let us look at the ones that I recommend you to try out above all the rest.
WeUseCoins
WeUseCoins was one of the first portals I found very useful to polish my Bitcoin knowledge.
You are able to acquire news updates, starting guides, FAQs, Mining tips, and buying guides for
Bitcoins as well as altcoins. Some of the most influential Bitcoin experts and miners share their
experiences and tips on this website. In addition, you can certainly learn a lot from them. To get
you started, you can read their posts about some of my favorite and 100%-noteworthy topics:
1. Decentralized Bitcoin
2. Tips on Securing Your Online Mining Presence
3. Why Wont Bitfinex/Tether Publish Already Existing Reports
4. Should You Buy Bitcoin with a Credit Card
5. How Latin American Growth Will Advance Through Bitcoin
6. The Process of Accepting Bitcoin Payments for your Business
7. BCash Hard Fork
8. A Guide to Claiming and Selling Bitcoin Forks
9. Top Cryptocurrencies Besides Bitcoin
10. Purchasing Litecoin
The Subreddit: /R/Bitcoin
I already mentioned it, but now I highly recommend that you follow this portal for all the latest
updates regarding Bitcoins in specific. It is one of the highest-ranking platforms on Reddit, and
this reputation makes it worth subscribing. You should note that other Redditors share external
links here that will give you an idea of the most fascinating news leaks related to
cryptocurrencies.
Coindesk
With an estimated visitor count of a few million every month, Coindesk is the largest and the
leading source of Bitcoin information. A great thing I like about Coindesk is that there is no
sponsored submission on this platform. This makes the posts more trustworthy to read. It may
sometimes be hard for you to keep track of the number of posts updating on this website. A way
to cope with that is by subscribing to their newsletter and reading the posts you find useful, while
briefly glancing over the trivial ones.
DCMagnates
This website platform offered me not only the latest news about Bitcoins and altcoins, but also
advice and guides on trading in these coins. It has a great collection of articles comprising of
news updates, trading assessments for Bitcoin, and other currencies, such as Litecoin. You
should sign up to their newsletter to stay updated about any new posts.
Recommended Bitcoin Calculators
Some of the above websites and apps offer Bitcoin calculators, but I found more useful
information related to Bitcoin trading analysis and calculations at the following portals.
BitcoinX
BitcoinX’s profitability calculator provides the most extensive information based on the
information you enter. The fields that it calculates and covers for your information are:
Difficulty
Mining Factor
Average generation time for a block (solo)
Hardware break even
Net profit first time frame
Coins per 24h at these conditions
Power cost per 24h
Revenue per day
Less power costs
System efficiency
Mining Factor
Average Mining Factor 100
Power cost per time frame
Revenue per time frame
Less power costs
These fields are enough to give you an idea of whether you will make any profit from your status
in the Bitcoin world or not.
The Bitcoin Wisdom Calculator
This calculator offered by Bitcoin Wisdom not only updates the usual profitability information,
but also targets the latest prices of interesting hardware related to Bitcoins and other
cryptocurrencies. It is worth visiting if you are planning on upgrading your equipment and want
to find all competitive prices in one place.
Conclusion
Bitcoins have been helpful in reaping benefits that were never imaginable before. In fact, many
major-scale industries are actually making millions by mining and exporting cryptocurrencies.
Many people find these useful, because they have an international currency status. A person with
Bitcoins can use them in any part of the world by converting them into the conventional currency
of that region. In addition, the security of the blockchain network is top-notch, which ensures
that your money is sent to or received from the right person, and that too without the need of
disclosing either one’s identity online.
Many have seen the numerous benefits Bitcoins provide. A major one is that there is third-party
influence, which would have charged a fee for a transaction otherwise. This is why Bitcoins are
supported by many small and large-scale industries who do not have to rely on intermediaries
any more. Support from users strengthens the existence of Bitcoins, and if all people in the world
start using it, then the day is not far off when Bitcoin replaces all currencies as the official one.
But, there are still disadvantages due to skeptics at the moment. Many hesitate to learn and
become involved in it because it is an innovative and self-governing technology. But, with time,
this issue can be resolved as more and more people embrace it.
Long Learning Curve, But Surely Worth It!
The concept of Bitcoin has a long learning curve that makes sure that the competitors are out of
the picture. In addition, the rising value of Bitcoins has been possible because there was very
little saturation involved in this crypto currency exchange. With such a rising value, there is no
doubt that many investment companies are promoting this cryptocurrency among the people to
their fullest. Long-term investment in this currency will certainly garner enough assets.
The long learning curve may be complicated to grasp. But, this digital asset’s performance is not
influenced by individual companies, bonds/stocks, or the economy. No physical place is present
that stocks these currencies in one place. And there is certainly no chance of hacking or
exploiting anyone’s assets (not that I know of), as the chain is spread throughout the internet.
Here, everyone is an owner without any centralized banking system to control it.
Keeping the five steps you learnt above in mind will ensure that you reap maximum rewards by
mining your favorite cryptocurrency. But, you need to invest in this field smartly. Being
emotional will not mean that you earn more. Invest with a mindset that you may occasionally
lose as well.
The Crypto world is like the Wild West, where you are free to explore, invest and earn as much
as you like. You chose this book to learn about this independent world and found useful tips to
get you started. My book will help you on the way, if you choose it to, but remember that the
final decision to choose the right path is yours.
In the end, I would like to appreciate all my fellow readers that chose this book to learn about the
concepts of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency mining. It may not have the advanced-level stuff, as it
was meant to stay simple so that beginners can learn about it and move on to the next step.
I am glad you showed your interest in joining the new digital currency frontier, which has great
potential in the future. Staying put before the calm will offer you a head-start, so that you know
how to trade in the world of Bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies.
The ICO Approach
A Beginner’s Guide to Understanding Cryptocurrency ICO
Chapter one: Introduction
Definition Of Initial Coin Offering
Initial coin offering, commonly known as ICO, is the mechanism used to raise funds for
financingcryptocurrency-related ventures and it is mostly used by startups as a way of evading
the regulated capital-raising mechanisms used by banks or venture capitalists. For example, the
Ethereum cryptocurrency project has already raised a lot of money in ICO. This investment
model is closely related to Initial Public Offering (IPO) whereby interested investors purchase
shares of a certain company. In ICO, the resulting coins are called tokens and they can be
equated with the shares of a company that are sold to the investors. ICO has dominated the
blockchain community, and many view ICO projects as securities that are unregulated. This can
enable the founders to raise the capital required to undertake a certain crypto venture. To make it
simple, crowdsourcing eliminates the hustle that is very common in the capital venture process.
In every ICO campaign, a given cryptocurrency percentage is sold to the initial funders of the
project as an exchange for a legal tender or another cryptocurrency like Bitcoin.
Every cryptocurrency startup must create an elaborate plan in its white paper explaining what the
project is about, the problems that the project will solve after its completion, the amount of
money needed to fund the venture, and the percentage of the coin that the pioneers will keep for
themselves if the project succeeds. However, if the venture fails, the funds are returned to the
financers and the ICO is said to have been unsuccessful. If the funds are enough, the project is
initiated or the funds can be used to complete the project.
Generally, ICOs can be easily structured with the aid of technologies like ERC20 Token
Standards, which ease the process of developing any cryptographic assets. Investors contributeto
the ICO development by sending their funds in the form of Ether or Bitcoin to a set smart
contract that can store their funds and, later, distribute the equivalent value of the new token.
Anyone can participate in an ICO because this venture has few restrictions, if any, assuming the
fact that the token is not a security. Compared to the global pool that many investors find
themselves in, with ICOs one can easily raise astronomical profits if things go well. However,
there is a large margin of risk because they are extremely speculative since most of them raise
pre-product money. But before discussing ICOs in detail, let us look at the historical context of
how the entire trend started.
History of ICOs
The year 2014 turned to be one of the most dramatic points in crypto history because this was the
time the ICO projects begun. Earlier on, many projects employed the crowd-sale model to fund
their projects. A good example is Ripple, which pre-mined about one billion XRP tokens which
were sold to potential investors in exchange for Bitcoin or flat currencies. Early in 2014,
Ethereum raised about 18 million dollars and this turned out to be the largest ICO completed at
that time. The DAO was the initial attempt at raising funds for an upcoming token on the
Ethereum system and it aimed at creating a decentralized and elaborate organization that would
also fund other blockchain projects. However, the decisions and governance of the coin would be
executed by the pioneers themselves.
DAO became a great success and managed to raise more than $150 million. However, due to
much technical vulnerability, an unknown hacker broke into the system and drained millions
from the DAO organization. The foundation opted to still focus forward despite this drawback.
After the failure of the attempt to raise money to fund tokens using the Ethereum platform, the
blockchain community realized that it was easier to raise the tokens compared to following the
venture capital funding model. The ERC20 standards make the process of developing ICO
tokens easy in the Ethereum platform which is blockchain based. When Ethereum opened the
door for smart contracts, it unveiled a great potential for a generation of ICOs. With the ease of
use of this system on top of a few regulations that have been set, startups have raised a large
amount of funds within a short period and Aragon, as a perfect example, managed to raise about
$25 million within 15 minutes. Out of the simplicity of creating tokens on the Ethereum
blockchain platform, a wide variety of tokens have been created to serve different purposes.
Chapter 2: ICOs in Detail
We always encounter many news about ICO ventures, but due to insufficient explanations in
these news publications, it becomes difficult for many people to understand everything about
ICO in detail. This eBook sets out to explain how ICOs work and why they are opted for as a
fundraising model.
How ICOs Work
An initial coin offering can be viewed as a refined form of crowdfunding that has emerged
outside the common financial system. This technique has enabled companies to undertake some
great projects and, through crowdfunding, they have secured the funding required to fund their
projects.
ICO can be said to be the cryptocurrency version of crowdfunding that has been well
incorporated into the crypto world, and this model is here to stay. An ICO event extends up to
one or more weeks whereby everyone is always allowed to buy new tokens in exchange for
Bitcoin or any other established cryptocurrency. Every ICO has a specific limit or goal for the
project funding and this means that every single token always has a pre-determined price that
does not change throughout the initial coin offering periods; this is what makes the supply of the
token static.
There can also be a static supply with a dynamic funding objective, whereby the distribution of
the token will depend on the amount of funds received and this results ina higher token price if
the project receives more funding.
What is an ICO presale period?
As implied by the name, pre-ICO sales give the investors a chance to buy the tokens before the
onset of the official sales. A pre-ICO sale is based on a smart contract to keep the funds separate
from the official sale to avoid confusion. Generally, few funds are gathered at the presale stage
because, during this period, the ICO tokens are sold at a lower price on top of certain bonuses to
the investors. Different organizations initiate the presale for different reasons. Just to give you a
glimpse, these are some of the common reasons why companies initiate presales prior to the
official opening of the crowdfunding.
It is used as a promotional tool by most of the companies. An ICO is always an easy way
of distributing capital and ensuring that the investors will stand for the upcoming project.
An ICO presale is more of “buy one, get one for free” kind of approach. The presale thus
ends up raising awareness about the ICO. This is always the best period to invest in an
ICO because the tokens are sold at a lower price because the companies give offers that
will attract the attention of the investors. After the implementation of the project, the
companies increase their profits after getting enough long-term investors.
Some of the companies may opt to initiate a presale as a way of testing the potential that
the ICO has. Simply, they aim to understand whether people are interested in their ICO
and whether they are willing to invest in it.
This undertaking is also a tool that attracts and keeps long-term investors’ whole belief in
the idea, products, or services offered by the company.
Generally, the main aim of a presale in an ICO is to attract angel investors who fund the
operational costs of the company when the white papers and roadmaps are being worked out.
While an ICO presale is a great way that the company can raise some funds to jumpstart its
operations, the company can also be hurt, especially if many tokens are sold at a low price during
the offer period. Most of the companies begin their presale period about a month before the
official release of the ICO, but such an opportunity cannot be available to every person because
the presale may be accompanied by some limitations. To participate in this, one needs a KYC
(know your customer) approval and secondly, to meet the minimum amount needed. For
instance, the lowest set amount could be $10,000 and the maximum amount cap per person could
be about $1,000,000.
Pros of an ICO presale
Liquidity. As an investor, one can trade tokens in secondary markets instead of fixing up
a given value in equity of a certain company.
Ensures there is a good distribution of capital. When an ICO presale is well organized, it
opens a great door that facilitates allocation of capital in a rational manner. With ICOs,
there is no any demographic or geographic barrier and anyone can be involved in this
investment, regardless of their nationality.
A crowd-funded ICO startup has many supporters. In ICOs, many people are involved
and incentivized to be participants of the project and the company ends up getting many
supporters who are committed and engaged with the happenings of the company.
Cons of an ICO presale
Many scams and frauds. Scammers sometimes take advantage of such opportunities to
illegally raise money which ends up in the pockets of certain people and not in the project
that was initially presented to the vibrant investors.
Restrictions and risks. Economists always argue that the greater the margin of risk, the
greater the reward. In simple terms, very risky projects always have a high potential for
producing great returns. Based on this risk, it is advisable for one to be cautious when
investing in ICOs because some projects may end up failing and the presale investors’
end up losing large sums of money, especially when the companies fail to refund the
investors.
Loyalty related issues. In the presale phase, most investors buy large amounts of tokens at
a cheaper price because of the favorable offers that are used to attract investors at the
beginning. When the prices rise, most investors immediately sell all their tokens, thus
defaulting the company.
For any ICO to succeed and bring awesome profits, some key parameters need to be accounted
for. These are some of the key things that one must pay attention to when deciding which a good
is or a bad presale and whether it is worthwhile to invest in or not:
Reviews. When considering whether to buy a certain product or undertake a certain
investment, reviews act as a guide to whether the product is worth it or not. Presale ICOs
are not an exception to this determinant. As an investor, make sure that you check all the
critiques and opinions given by the investors who have preceded you in investing in the
presale under question. Out of the reviews, make sure that you have a general idea or
glimpse of what other people perceive and think about the ICO. This will act as your
navigator and you will finally end up making a wise decision.
Funding by well-established companies. Ensure that you carry out your research to find
out if the company that is behind the pre-ICO in question has any parent organization or
partnership with a bigger company. This is yet another criterion that indicates whether the
ICO company is legit or not. More often, ICO presales that have partnered with wellestablished companies end up being very successful. Such ICOs have a lower probability
of fraudism and are likely to have exceptional offers.
Rumors. Always keep your ear open to what people are saying about a certain ICO
presale in social media and other forums. Consider whether people find the ICO presale
trustworthy, suspicious, or interesting. Even if rumors are not a credible source of
information, sometimes they can bear some leaked information about a given ICO. At the
same time, remember to read what ICO experts are saying about a certain presale.
Hype. Make sure that you have a good understanding of what the product is and what the
company is offering and try to figure out whether it is worth that. Concurrently, make
sure that you avoid the “too good” kinds of offers as most such exciting projects end up
being big scams that rob people their hard-earned money. If the ICO presale is good, you
will encounter it in social media and various cryptocurrency forums. A good presale will
also have a good customer support desk that is responsive and ready to answer all
customer questions.
On the other hand, after the presale period, the ICO is then released to the public whereby
anyone can buy the tokens if they are willing and able to meet the established requirements.
During this going-public-period, the tokens are always sold at a higher price when compared to
the presale period where only a few people were willing to risk their funds in investing at that
initial point.
After carrying out your research, settle on a certain ICO that you are confident enough to invest
in and if the ICO is good enough, think of making a presale purchase of the coins because, at this
point, you will be able to buy the tokens at a relatively cheaper price, regardless of the quantum
of tokens that you need. Sometimes, at this point, willing investors may be offered up to a 50
percent discount and if one purchases a handsome number of tokens at this point, one is assured
of reaping great profits when the tokens are released publicly where their value becomes a
multiple of the original value at the presale period.
The bottom line on this issue of ICO presale and public sales is that buying the tokens before the
official launchoffers more value for your investment than buying them after launching.
Maximizing Your Profits If The ICO Takes Off
An ICO is a great venture with amazing profits if it is well undertaken. For example, if you
purchased $100-worth of BTC on 2011, it would have cost $0.30 per BTC, and with your $100
investment, you would have received 333.33 BTC then. If you kept these Bitcoins for seven
good years, by 2017 the price of BTC had shot up to about $11,000 and your initial $100 would
be currently worth about $3.5m. By simple mathematics, this is a 35, 000 percent profit within
seven years! This makes ICOs and the entire crypto world one of the most profitable investments
in history. This meteoric rise of Bitcoin excites investors about cryptocurrencies and with heavy
and smart investment by buying promising tokens. But just to guide you, this is how you can
grow your crypto investments and maximize profits and make moneywhen the ICO of your
choice takes off.
We have seen much about ICOs, and when you participate in an ICO, you receive coins or
tokens as a contributor to the project. Now, after receiving the tokens, you must get your
investment back and maximize profits. How do you retrieve your investment after receiving the
tokens? How do you maximize profits after receiving the ICO coins? Among others, these are
some of the common questions that every ICO investor cannot avoid asking themselves. These
are good questions and, in this eBook, you will learn how to do all this as a newbie in ICO
investing.
The tokens and the coins are also commonly referred to as altcoins and are usually issued by
ICO- based projects. Thisvaries from one platform to another and different tokens are stored in
their corresponding wallets. For example, Bitcoin has several variants with different wallets like
Trezor, Armory,and Electrum where one can store the tokens. Foe Ethereum-based tokens, they
are usually ERC20s tokens and MEW and MyEtherWallet are the best wallets to store them.
Other token variants have their specific wallets depending on their platforms.
Understanding this issue of wallets for various tokens is very important so that you can store
your tokens in the appropriate wallet, and this is always the first step in turning your altcoins into
liquid cash. To protect your investment, it is important that you transfer the altcoinsfrom the
company’s or project’s ICO page to your personal wallets, which are more secure. This is more
like putting your stock bonds in a vault. After this, the next thing is always to wait until the
altcoin you have invested in is listed in the exchange system. In simple terms, an exchange is a
market where you can sell or buy commodities and this system is more like the stock exchange.
Here, your altcoins work like the stocks.
Secure The Bonus Tokens
Many ICOs tend to offer bonuses as incentives to investors who contribute early, before the ICO
is officially launched publicly. For instance, the minimum requirement of investing in the
LiveEdu ICO in the initial stages was $3. But at this stage, one qualified for at least a 25 percent
bonus if they invested 50 percent or more and that is why serious investors should invest in the
pre-ICO stage because, with the bonuses, you are assured of receiving more tokens in addition to
what you have targeted for your investment.
Hold And Sell Some Technique
After receiving the tokens, you can start trading them on exchange for different cryptocurrencies
like ETH or BTC or, sometimes, cash. After receiving the coins, a good idea would be to
immediately sell about 30 percent of the tokens so that you can recoup your initial investment
and then hold the remaining 70 percent for some time before you think of selling them again.
Still, the cryptocurrency market is very volatile and a lot of uncertainty and fear surrounds the
ICO tokens. However, this should not hinder you from investing.
Keep things simple
Investing in ICOs comes with risk, but never allow these risks to force you into overthinking; In
fact, risk-taking is common in every business. Always do your best and make sure you carry out
some research before investing in a certain token. In this, you do not need to use some
complicated scientific modelsto predict which tokens will yield great returns. You just need to
understand a few things about the product offering before investing in it. And to make huge
profits, keep your eye on promising tokens and make sure you are involved early enough.
Chapter Three: How to Pick a Winning ICO
The cryptocurrency sector is a rapidly growing market with a very high potential but before you
jump into this market with astonishing profits, it is very crucial for you to understand how to
choose a good ICO to invest in. The success of any ICO coin is influenced by several aspects and
in this chapter we will look at how you can choose a winning ICO.
At this point, it is worthwhile to mention stories of failed ICOs like the Mycelium ICO, whose
developers disappeared after raising the money. It was afterward reported that they used the
funds for their vacation. The increased lack of regulation of this sector may be the reason $7
million was hacked and stolen from the Coin Dash’s ICO. This happened just before the sale of
the tokens began. The hacker broke into the system and the ICO wallet address was replaced
with the hackers’ address.
Based on the above incidents, ICOs are a very risky way of fundraising and it is important for
you to take precautions by never attempting to invest what you cannot afford to lose in case the
project fails, because you will have difficulty in getting your money back. Before investing in a
certain ICO, consider the following issues.
Issues to Consider
1. Consider the team behind the ICO project
When researching on the coin to invest in, always check everythingrelated to the
development team plus the body that offers advice to the developers. Scrutinize the
individual members of the team by considering their knowledge and experience in
starting and running ICO-based projects and their overall experience in the
cryptocurrency world. You can visit their LinkedIn profiles, Google the names of the
individuals involved, and look for any famous names on the advisory board. Generally,
check the ICO projects they have been involved in; you can research further and check
how successful their earlier projects have been.
2. Carefully evaluate the white paper
Most investors never bother to read the white paper, even if it contains all the necessary
information about the upcoming ICO project. As an investor, always make sure that you
read the entire white paper and make sure that you identify the negative and positive
aspects of the project and include this in your research. After reading the whole white
paper, make sure you can explain what the project is bringing to the world and make sure
you have a good grasp of what ICO you are investing in.
3. What is the token needed for?
An ICO is essentially meant for the creation of a new token dedicated for a specific
project. The most evident question here is what the token is meant for. Why aren’t
Ethereum and Bitcoin sufficient enough to serve as the tokens of the project being
undertaken? You must ask yourself such questions because some projects just make up a
scummy story to back up their venture. However, remember that an ICO cannot be a
perfect ICO if it has no dedicated token. These questions still must be asked about the
usage of blockchain technology on that project.
4. Social media and online presence
As an investor, when you Google the name of the company, you should be able to find
sufficient information regarding it. Check out the press releases of the company, their
blog, and their social media activities. With the information from those sources, you will
be able to gauge their trustworthiness and monitor their activities. Also, remember to
check the opinions of your fellow investors on the platforms that have been dedicated to
the cryptocurrency investors regarding the ICO project in question.
5. Is the ICO a hard cap or unlimited?
In past years, a hard cap and open ICOs did not have as muchimpact as today. An open
cap gives investors the opportunity to send an unlimited amount of funds to the ICO
project wallet. On this issue, many tend to forget that if many coins are circulating, the
token becomes less unique and afterward there may be difficulty in trading the coin
because the demand will be low. On the other hand, make sure that you are not the only
person investing in a certain project because exchanges always have little interest with
the projects that raise little because this makes it difficult for you to trade the tokens after
they are released.
6. Check the quality of the codes
If you have basic programming skills, you can apply the knowledge here. The quality of
the ICO project developer can be understood by just carrying out a simple analysis of the
codes. As a non-techie in the programming world, you can simply evaluate the quality of
the code by checking the consistency of the code.
ICOs are becoming a main stream fundraising method and, based on the many upcoming
projects that are using ICOs. However, by following these key guidelines, you can easily pick
out all the negative and positive aspects and be able to make a wise decision on which ICO
project to invest in.
Chapter Four: How to get started
Know Your Customer Protocol
Verification is a great challenge all over, and the digital world is not an exception. Companies
take strict measures to scrutinize and verify the identity of their clients and at the same time,
customers are becoming more cautious and sensitive with most companies, especially when it
comes to giving out their information, which is sensitive, or when investing with a given
company. In the cryptocurrency world, various regulators in various countries across the globe
are becoming more interested with ICOs and this has brought a lot of uncertainty to both those
who are offering the ICOs and those who are willing to invest in them.
There are many reasons why one should opt to invest in ICOs and this ranges from the
speculation that the value of the coin will rise to the belief of high utilityfor a new piece of
crypto. Unfortunately, lack of regulation in the crypto space means that anyone willing to invest
in a given project always feel they are risking being treated like money launderers. Because,
most of the time, legislation may be unclear or absent, know your customer (KYC) is a broadly
used concept in the finance world globally.
Currently, the regulation of ICOs is based on KYC and this has turned out to be a necessity to
ensure that potential investors can legally and willingly participate in the ICO investment. This is
mainly because scamming activities have been spotted and the KYC-related policies and issues
that have been implemented within the financial institutions have been incorporated into the ICO
sector.
Importance Of KYC Compliance For An ICO
The incorporation of KYC in the ICO world is because of true incidents because many investors
and ICOs have suffered and many crypto scams worth millions of dollars have already occurred.
Due to lack of proper regulatory measures and policies, fraudsters from both the investment and
the ICO side have taken advantage of this loophole and this has resulted in some serious scams
and money laundering using the ICO system. Any investor found undertaking money laundering
activities will put all the involved entities to the investigation, including the ICO issuer. This
narrows all the way to Anti Money Laundering (AML), which is one of the basic requirements of
KYC.
How One Can Ensure KYC Compliance
One can essentially ensure KFC compliance in several ways. For example, if you are offering a
service or a product that makes it necessary for the client to walk in and register so that they can
be allowed to purchase the product, then you can have all the information verified face to face.
It’s the same case in the digital world, whereby, if you are providing online services or offering
products like ICOs, then the best option is to get the information from a third-party identity
verification service provider.
The KYC procedures are based on the collection and keen analysis of the identification
documents of an individual as well as the data about the funds used for the purchase. The main
purpose of this lengthy procedure is always to deter the activities of criminals who want to use
legitimate market platforms for fraudulent activities like tax evasion, terrorist funding, and
money laundering. The crypto world has already experienced these malpractices and this has
raised the need for good KYC compliance, to make sure that all things are streamlined and both
parties are safe.
KYC steps
Verification of the client’s profile
Before beginning the KYC process, just ensure that you have a copy of your
identification card and any valid document like a passport in electronic form, for the
purposes of uploading. These personal details are legally required and both parties must
provide this data in the ICO investment contracts.
KYC verification
Your personal ID is then compared with the data in your profile and any mismatch will
be automatically detected by the automatic compliance check. At this stage, make sure
that you provide the right information and let your profile and documented information
be the same.
Video verification
At this stage, you should be ready with your ID for video identification, where you will
be asked to display all your documents in the video call. Make sure that your ID
document is still the same as what you used in step one. You can schedule a video call,
but if the agent is available at that moment, then you can proceed with the video call
immediately. The agent will then ask you several questions to verify your identity.
Digital signature
This is always the last step, and once the agent has fully verified your identification, you
will then digitally sign. Mostly, a code is sent to you via mobile text within a few
minutes. Feed the code into the system and the process will be completed.
Sometimes this process maybe daunting and tiresome, but the level of complexity will depend on
the protocols that have been set in place by your token provider. However, this is a very
important step because it ensures that, as a contributor to the ICO project, you are fully
protected. With the KYC verification procedure, you are always sure that not only is your project
secured, but also that you, as a token buyer, are protected from any possibility of anyone
claiming that the resulting funds are not legitimate.
Crypto wallets
A crypto wallet is simply a digital wallet that is used to receive, send, or store digital currencies
like Bitcoin or Ethereum, among other currencies. Most of the coins have an official wallet
where they are stored or a third-party wallet that has been approved where one can store the
digital coins.
Ideally, they are just like normal leather wallets in real life, used for carrying cash or our credit
cards. The only difference is that the cryptocurrency wallets are in a virtual form. However, this
virtual wallet, unlike the traditional wallet, tells you the balance that you have, your last
expenditure, and such things that your leather wallet cannot tell you. Like digital applications,
cryptocurrency wallets are smarter in the sense that they combine all the benefits of your
physical wallet with more flexible and sophisticated features. With just one wallet, one can hold
many digital currencies without ever worrying about something like running out of space.
As a cryptocurrency investor, you must familiarize yourself with how the wallets work so that
once you acquire your tokens; you can have a smooth ride in trading in the ICO world.
The Working Mechanism Of Cryptocurrency Wallets
Cryptocurrency wallets work in the same way as a safety deposit box that you use to store your
treasures like jewelry, certificates, or a will. You cannot afford to lose the key of such a box
because it means that you will essentially lose ownership of the expensive possessions therein if
the key falls into the wrong hands.
Cryptocurrency wallets work in this manner, only, instead of having physical keys, you will have
a digital keycommonly known as a master key. Some people refer to these as private keys. They
always come in the form of hexadecimal codes and they may look like this:
2940447a4ed5eef7f46bcc185cb2f21d2a8bffcde5418156a9d1a44aa137558
At first glance, they may seem to be complicated and daunting to understand, but with time, you
will master them. When investing in ICO tokens or any other digital assets, make sure that you
secure your wallet by taking care of your private key. You will always need the key to get access
to your assets and authorize transfers from your wallet. So always keep your key in a safe place
where you can easily retrieve it any time you need it.
Where Can You Get A Cryptocurrency Wallet?
You can easily get cryptocurrency wallets by signing up for one of the wallets. The
cryptocurrency wallets are available in the following forms.
Desktop
These are wallets that are downloaded and stored on a laptop or PC and they are only
accessed through the computer on which these wallets were downloaded. Desktop wallets
are very secure, but this security can be compromised if your computer gets a virus or is
hacked. But generally, desktop wallets are some of the safest wallets that you can use.
Online wallets
This kind of wallet runs in the cloud and one can access it using a computing device from
any location. They are easy to access and more convenient, but the key is stored online by
a third party and this makes it more prone to hacking.
Mobile
These wallets run on an application installed on your mobile phoneand they are very
convenient because they can be used in any place to carry out ICO token-related
transactions.
Hardware
These ones are different from software wallets because the private key is stored on
hardware like a USB device. Although, with the hardware wallet transactions are still
made online, there is better security with this kind of a wallet because everything is
stored offline. The user just needs to plug in the hardware to an Internet-enabled device
from any place and then he or she can make transactions.
Single Currency Or Multicurrency Use?
Bitcoin is the most known digital currency but many altcoins have emerged, each with a unique
infrastructure and ecosystem. But the good news to those investing in several ICOs is that there
are some wallets that support several coins. You do not need to have a separate wallet for your
coins; you simply must set up a multi-currency wallet which will effectively enable you to
concurrently use several coins from one wallet.
Are the crypto wallets secured?
Cryptocurrency wallets have been built to be very secure, although the exact level of security
will differ from one wallet to another. But in general, like your usernames and passwords, the
security of your wallet is ensured by strictly following best security practices. Just to guide you,
these are some of the practices to secure your wallet:
1. Obtain a secure wallet
With many cryptocurrency wallets available out there, it is wise to locate a wallet that is
secured above what is offered by common wallet providers. Some wallets are now
incorporating encryption techniques to add extra privacy to private keys.
2. Use cold storage technique
Users should have at least two wallets, but the number should depend on the amount of
crypto funds that a user has. One wallet should be strictly for transactional and trading
purposes while the other wallet should be used only for secure storage of the ICO tokens.
This type of wallet, that is only used for storage and never involved in any transaction, is
usually referred to as a cold storage wallet. Always ensure that in the trading wallet, you
have only a few ICOs that are sufficient for your current trading activities.
3. Wi-Fi wisdom
Always be cautious about the sites you visit online using a device that has ICO wallets in
it. Risky Wi-Fi, and some malicious websites, may put your wallet to risk. Also, remember
that you should attend well to this device and never lend it to any person.
4. Gone phishing
In the crypto world, there are many phishing scams through emails or Google Ads.
Phishing scams are very common, so always ensure that the emails you receive from the
wallet companies always have their domains spelled out clearly and never look for their
web addresses by clicking on a Google Ad.
5. Turn off any auto updates
You should turn off the auto updates for all your applications related to the crypto sphere
because most of the application bags have the potential to cause harm to the wallet
owner.
6. Double check all the addresses
It is always important to make sure that you have double checked all the addresses that
you are sending any payments to. This is because there are malicious programs that can
copy the procedures and then paste them to a different address belonging to the attacker.
Which are the best wallets?
The number of wallets is increasing every day and users have many options to choose from.
However, before you settle your mind on which wallet to use in your ICO investment, just
consider these following key things:
Are you planning to invest in several ICOs or one?
Do you need to access your digital wallet from any place or will you use it only when at
home?
Will you use your wallet for everyday purchases or are you interested in just buying and
holding the coins as your investment?
Having asked yourself those few questions and having assessed your requirements keenly, then
you can easily settle on which wallet will serve your interests well and by this, you will be able
to choose the most suitable wallet.
Some of the best crypto wallets for ICO tokens:
1. MyEtherWallet
This is one of the most popular wallets in the crypto world. It can be effectively used to
buy, sell, and store the ERC20 tokens that have been obtained from ICO token sales. It is
one of the most accepted wallets because is a wallet available online in addition to
providing an offline wallet at the same time.
2. Jaxx
This is another awesome wallet. It can hold, trade, and control your Bitcoin, Litecoin,
Ethereum, Augur, and dozens of blockchain-based assets. It gives you complete control
of your key, on top of having simple but great features.
3. Trezor
This is a hardware wallet that offers a very secure way of keeping your coins safe from
hackers and malware. Its most conspicuous features are cross-platform support and the
OLED display.
4. KeepKey
This is yet another hardware wallet that secures Ethereum, Bitcoin, Litecoin, and other
tokens. It also offers a USB connection as one of its unique features.
5. Exodus
This a multi-digital assets wallet and the first desktop wallet to have an inbuilt Shape
Shift that allows for easy and fast conversion of various cryptocurrency tokens and
altcoins. It also enables one to store the private key in an application that has a user
interface which is customizable.
Legal Status Of ICOs In Various Countries
Currently, most ICO projects are defining themselves simply as presale program tokens. But
from a legal point of view, they are most like selling early access to online games. Project
owners tend to use the terms “mass sale” and “donations” instead of ICO so that they can
escape from falling under the stock trading companies’ category.
Determining the legal status of an ICO in your country is beneficial because, without a good
legal framework, few investors from the real economy sector will be interested in investing their
funds in ICO startups. Without a good legal framework, ICO tokens will be unattractive and this
may limit the development potential of this sector.
On this issue, others still believe that the industry will be better without regulations because the
authorities will not interfere with the ICO projects into which the investors are chipping in their
funds. The downside of this issue is that with the absence of a good legal framework between
token sellers and the investors, the ICO niche remains open for scammers who are always ready
to profit from the investors who dream of making money from the tokens they purchase.
Perceived Challenges With ICOs
Many countries are reluctant about ICOs mainly because there are no good regulatory
mechanisms put in place and technically, they represent a regulatory workaround. The issue
behind this is that instead of seeking an initial public offering, businesses can be funded without
any regulatory requirements, due diligence, time, or any fiduciary permission compared to the
traditional IPO requirements. This peer-based system offers funding opportunities to ICO
startups that would not be eligible for funding through the traditional approach.
Many countries argue that this approach is very comparable with fraud, and this is the main
reason some countries like South Korea and China have banned the selling and creation of ICOs
in their countries because there is a big door that scammers can use to defraud innocent
investors in the ICO sector. Meanwhile, many countries are pursuing changes to their policies so
that they can codify adherence to anti-money laundering issues. On top of this, if an ICO relates
to flat currencies or property transfer, this may be essentially dealing with securities and this
causes effects on the securities’ integrity and taxation issues.
Progressive Countries In Terms Of ICOs
Applicability of ICO products, professional support teams, and extensive marketing campaigns
on top of well-organized documentation are still insufficient for an ICO to succeed. Choice of
jurisdiction is another vital aspect. The most favorable and progressive jurisdictions towards
ICOs and the crypto sector are Singapore, the US, Scotland, Switzerland, and several more
nations. Such countries that are supportive of the ICO have well-dictated procedures that give
ICO projects a legal entity and tax legislation and this makes them friendly and favorable to the
ICO startups.
Vitalik Buterin’s Ethereum is an example of how Switzerland is favorable to crypto companies.
The Swiss government has a good predisposition towards ICO startups because of their
significant contribution to the economy of the country. Favorable conditions for the development
of new crypto startups are the main reason why many cryptocurrency-based companies have
been established in Switzerland. Even though Switzerland is one of the most ICO-friendly
countries, most of the European Union members remain adamant and they are not the best
choice for ICO-related ventures. One of the greatest challenges in these countries is the data
protection laws whereby the financial companies must delete all information of transactions that
have been processed by the clients from the database whenever a client requests it. But in the
blockchain, one of the distinctive features is that information cannot be deleted and this is
always interpreted as a violation of data protection laws.
Singapore is another good country but the charges may be high. The government is welldisposed to technology and it is very favorable to ICO investments, although Hong Kong is
cheaper and a better choice than Singapore. However, they have very strict taxation policies.
Being the mother of the technology, the United States is very friendly to ICO investments and has
excellent jurisdictions for the ICO, but this is exclusively for its residents. Nonresidents may be
subjected to serious expenses and, in my experience, severe scrutiny.
These are just a few examples of the countries that have fully incorporated ICOs into their
economic sector. As an investor, carry out some research to know the jurisdictions on
cryptocurrency that have been established in your country. Before investing, make sure that your
country is ICO friendly and, as an investor, make sure that you comply with the laws that have
been established to govern ICOs in your country.
The Future Of ICOs In Various Countries
Currently, the cryptocurrency market is worth billions of dollars and, based on this
capitalization, different nations have realized the importance of being involved in the crypto
arena. Even the skeptics now have less to question about the prospects and benefits of this
technology. Based on the potential gains in this sector, many nations are coming up with
regulations that will have an effect on the crypto world.
The current unregulated nature of the crypto marketmakes it more exposed to excessive
regulations that may have a chilling effect on the ICO development. This is because many
countries are seeking to close all the loopholes, and as the countries seek to become leaders in
the ICO world, more regulations are expected. While the upcoming regulations are expected to
minimize the expected investment risks, the investors still must take responsibility for their
investments or their due diligence when investing in ICO tokens.
Registration With ICO
Tokens or ICOs are gaining exceptional experience from institutions and individual investors as
well. ICOs are also referred to as next-generation crowdfunding or new IPOs. However, the
blockchain-based ecosystem is still new and lacks some standards, thus, registering and making
some token sales may be tricky to some people. Here is a quick guide to help you in registering
and participating in the sale:
1. Registering through the ICO project site itself
All the legitimate projects that use an ICO to raise funds have a website where they have
a clear explanation of what the project is all about, their objectives, funds needed, how
long the funding campaign will be, and all other necessary details. On this website, you
can register for the ICO as an investor. You will have to fill in your information and
verify all the details.
2. Get Ether or Bitcoin
To purchase ICOs, you need Bitcoins or Ethereum cryptocurrencies. Once you have these
coins in your wallet, you can then visit the project’s website where you will be presented
with all the information needed; you can see the amount that has already been raised by
the project and which is required for you to participate; you must then accept the
conditions and terms of service in order for you to continue. From this point, you can
then buy project tokens. The minimum amount that you are required to invest depends on
the ICO you are interested in, but the common amount is always in between $10and
$100. This amount is always stated in the project’s white paper and it can also be found
on the project’s website.
3. Move the coins to the wallet that you control.
This has been said countless times, that never keep your cryptocurrency coins in the
wallet that was initially provided by the exchange. This is because, in the exchange
wallet, your funds may be jeopardized because you have no complete control of your
wallet.
4. Buy the Initial Coin Offering Tokens.
After registering for an ICO and having your funds available, all you must do is send the
amount of the cryptocurrency you are willing to invest to the address of the ICO
campaign that you have opted to invest in. The basic goal of every ICO campaign is
always to get money and for this reason, the process is not trivial and the project website
provides clear guidelines to the investor.
5. Accuracy
When sending your funds, be careful and always ensure that you double check the
website address because theremight be fraudulent ICO websites on top of your Google
search outcomes. They resemble the actual website but several symbols in the address are
different.
6. Get ICO tokens to your address
You will then receive the new tokens that you have purchased into your wallet’s address
and if it does not happen instantly, be patient for a while. The time it takes for you to
receive the tokens depends on the campaign, and sometimes it may take even weeks
before you receive the tokens. Also, to keep yourself updated, communicate with your
fellow ICO investors in various forums and dedicated platforms. Sometimes, you may not
be able to trade the tokens immediately after receiving them, but this depends on the rules
established by the ICOs. The time to wait, when to begin trading, and any other necessary
information is always provided on the website of the project.
What is gas in ICO?
Gas is the cost that is used to facilitate transactions in Ethereum, usually in the form of Szabos.
(One Szabo is 1/1,000,000 of an Ether). The price of the gas for every transaction based on what
is needed toturn the complete the process based on the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine Code)
and the idea is always to limit the loops. For example, 0.00001 Ethers or 10 Szabos, also known
as 1 gas can, execute a given line of command effectively. If the Ether balance in your account is
insufficient to run the transaction or send the message, then the action is considered to be invalid;
to avoid this, always ensure that you have a handsome Ether balance in your account when
carrying out a transaction.
The amount of gas used depends on how heavy the command being executed is. For example, if
you want to send 1 Ether to another person, the total cost of the transaction will be 1.00001
Ether. This is just an example of a simple code. If you run a heavy code, for example, forming a
contract based on the future price of Ether with another person, more gas will be consumed
because several complex codes must be executed.
MetaMask Wallet
The broad Ethereum community has recently come up with MetaMask, which is a new tool that
is able to bring Ethereum to the user’s browser via a plugin that is currently available for Google
Chrome. This tool essentially enables one to run Ethereum dApps in the browser without the
need to run a complete Ethereum node.
Benefits of MetaMask
Using MetaMask, the Ethereum system has been made very accessible to average consumers and
this has been a very smart move. It is evident that the Ethereum ecosystem has many
advancements to offer, but many people find it difficult to adapt to them because even accessing
the dApps remains challenging to many because you have to run a complete Ethereum node. The
MetaMask tool thus brings great relief to the average ICO investor because this tool has bridged
this gap.
MetaMask addresses most of the problems experienced by common people because the plugin
allows the user to access the dApps directly from the Google Chrome. This alone is agreat
improvement since doing so has been a great challenge to many people because the dApps were
not appealing because of the complicated process involved.
MetaMask also provides a secure identity vault to the user, thus allowing them to manage their
identities across various websites, and these identities can also be used to sign the blockchain
transactions. This tool also has a convenient user interface that presents things well, thus
lowering the barrier to entry and usage as far as dApps and Ethereum are concerned. MetaMask
is expected to bring the Ethereum ecosystem a notch higher in the coming months and years.
Chapter Five: Things to Avoid
Just like any other cryptocurrency, ICOs come with risk, and to make a sound investment into an
ICO, you must perform due diligence. There have been many initial coin offerings that have
failed for various reasons such as the token being offered not offering utility or security, and the
company being unable to achieve a growth in price. ICOs are mostly underrated but have great
importance as they represent huge returns on investments.
In ICOs, tokens are used as a medium of information exchange using a token-based model which
implements blockchain technology. A company will experience greater demand through
numerous buyers obtaining the altcoin. The more buyers and holders of a certain altcoin, the
greater the demand and user base that company will experience. Therefore, crowdsourcing is
done through token sales rather than direct interaction between buyers and users.
For instance, when 5,000 new users sign up and purchase tokens in an ICO, the financial “get”
from the purchase of tokens is not only used as the first funding of a project but also to expand
the value of the tokens in question. One example of this is the Bancor ICO, which took in over
$153M in its ICO. These early buyers of the Bancor token are the most likely future users and
adopters of the core protocol and services that Bancor provides, as well as the support team that
will help sustain it.
Exit Scams
Despite the popularity of ICOs, coupled with successful projects, there have been several exit
scams which seem to be rising daily. An exit scam is a fraudulent practice by unethical
cryptocurrency promoters who vanish with investors’ money during or after an ICO. Exit scams
happen in a very simple way: first, promoters launch a cryptocurrency platform based on a
promising concept. Then the ICO raises money from various investors for a specified period
before disappearing, leaving investors in the lurch, unfortunately, this is a worrisome trend in the
world of ICOs and cryptocurrencies and will end up tarnishing the reputation of ICOs for quite
some time to come. It is difficult to trace scammers in these exit scams due to the decentralized,
anonymous, and regulation-free operations of the virtual currency ecosystem. Some recent ICO
exit fraud examples include Bitcoin, PlexCoin, and Confido. All these projects raised a small
amount of money before effectively calling it quits and disappearing altogether. In 2018 alone, a
total of $8.4m has been stolen to date, but the amount of stolen funds remains small compared to
seemingly legitimate projects raising $50m or more.
Due to increased exit scams, ICOs have been discouraged and burned on various platforms.
Investors have been warned by the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of the
presence of scammers who utilize the ICOs to generate interest by driving up the value of the
coins. ICO and cryptocurrency advertisements have been banned on various social media
platforms including Facebook, Google, Snapchat, LinkedIn, and Twitter due to increased scams
and the incredibility of their operations. Chinese Internet platforms Baidu, Tencent, and Weibo
have also prohibited ICO advertisement. The Japanese platform Line and the Russian platform
have similar prohibitions.
The SEC has also acknowledged that ICOs “may provide fair and lawful investment
opportunities.” The UK Financial Conduct Authority has also warned that ICOs are a very high
risk and speculative investments, are scams in some cases, and often offer no protection for
investors. The European Securities and Market Authority(ESMA) notes the high risk associated
with ICOs and the risk that investors may lose all their currencies.
Identifying Exit Scams
Identifying exit scams in their early stages can save investors a lot of investments. Although it is
evidently tough to recognize a dubious ICO, investors can monitor the ICO using the following
key points before making an investment decision.
1. Team Credibility
Accountability and ownership have been the biggest challenge in the ICO world, with
every developing ICO looking promising at first for investors but later turning out to be
an exit scam. Investors should, therefore, verify the credentials of the crypto team before
investing their hard-earned cash. Investors should be aware that these fraudulent schemes
are set up with huge starting capital. Therefore, they can do a lot to assure prospective
investors of their credibility including buying likes, tweets, and followers on various
social media platforms to build fake online credibility. They should perform a
rudimentary check on ICO sponsors and on the promoters of cryptocurrency projects and
the kind of networks they subscribe to.
2. Extravagant Return Projections (too good to be true)
When the deal is too sweet, think twice. An ICO promising an unimaginable return on an
investment is definitely an exit scam. For instance, BitConnect promised a steady one
percent daily return on an investment which would transform an initial investment of
$1,000 into a return of more than $50 million within three years, attracting numerous
investors despite the warning of a Ponzi scheme by Ethereum founder. Unfortunately for
them, BitConnect abruptly shut down its lending and exchange services in January 2018
after experiencing a meteoric rise and burgeoning client base since its ICO in December
2016. The market cap of BitConnect, which exceeded $2.7 billion in December 2017,
suddenly tanked to $17 million by March 2018, leaving investors with huge loses.
Investors should think critically before making an investment decision.
3. Document Standard
Documentation is key in identifying fraudulent ICOs. The white paper is the key
document explaining how an ICO project should function based on its design. Potential
exit scams are usually characterized by unclear and ambiguous white papers. This should
be a red flag to prospective investors.
4. Non-existent Working Model
Does the cryptocurrency project have a bare-bones working model? If it is a conceptonly, non-existent product, then it probably will not function. ICO project promoters
should prove that their developments function effectively and therefore can be worth
investing in. Investors should clearly understand the functionality of a certain project
before capitalizing on it.
5. Severely Promoted Offerings
A new ICO can be heavily promoted through expensive full-page ads, celebrities, and
paid bloggers to relay false information. These are signs of exit scams and investors
should be very careful when investing in such ICOs. Basically, it comes down to a
renowned investmentadvice—if you do not understand the business of the company, and
do not trust the people behind it, don’t invest in its shares. The same holds true for
cryptocurrency projects.
Multi-Level Marketing Systems
Multi-Level Marketing Systems are also fraudulent schemes in the world of ICO and should be
completely avoided by investors. Multi-Level Marketing Systems work based on Multi-Level
Tokens (MLT) which are inbuilt in the system. MLT is an ERC20 token built on the Ethereum
blockchain. The token is a derivative structural product that gives token holders the right to
acquire income out of the increased value of Ethereum. Token holders will also earn “coupon
revenue” from a bonus program built into the token’s smart algorithm. The bonus is earned
through referrals; therefore, you are encouraged to convince friends and family to buy the tokens,
in order for you to earn. Many Multi-Level Marketing Systems are fraudulent schemes where the
bonus earned is not usually paid out, but rather, the investors disappear with the income received
during referrals.
The Multi-Level Marketing System way of operation can be equated to a Ponzi scheme, which is
a fraudulent investment promising high rates of return with little risk to investors. The Ponzi
scheme generates returns for older investors by acquiring new investors. Just like the Ponzi
scheme, Multi-Level Marketing Systems focus all their energy on attracting new clients to make
investments through buying tokens. The income earned through the referrals is then utilized as a
return on investment on the project’s founders. A constant flow of new referrals is necessary for
the scheme to sustain itself, together with the founders. When this flow runs out, the scheme falls
apart, leaving token buyers with huge losses and in disarray.
Characteristics of Multi-Level Marketing Systems
It is simple to identify and avoid fraudulent Multi-Level Marketing Systems since they share the
same characteristics listed below
Guaranteed profits, coupled with few risks involved
High returns, inconsiderate of prevailing market conditions.
Investments that are not recognized by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
Secretive investment strategies
Clients having difficulties accessing their returns on investments in terms of money
Regulation
Following increased frauds associated with ICOs, including cyber thefts using Multi-Level
Marketing Systems and trading halts due to exit scams and possible market manipulation,
different countries have setup various regulations which are continually changing.
Cryptocurrencies are based on distributed ledger technologies enabling people to acquire or
transfer their cryptocurrencies directly to another person without the need of an intermediary.
Therefore, they are exposed to fraud. It is difficult to regulate ICOs and cryptocurrencies using a
central authority since they can easily be moved across national and jurisdictional boundaries.
However, countries have developed varied approaches to regulate ICOs and cryptocurrencies,
depending on the nature of the cryptocurrency.
Controlling cryptocurrencies can be broken down into two forms: utility tokens and asset-backed
tokens. Utility tokens hold more value than asset-backed tokens since they are essential for the
holder to exchange a token for a good or service in the future, for example, Bitcoin. Assetbacked tokens may have value because there is an underlying asset which the holder of the token
can attribute a value to. In most countries, asset-backed tokens are regulated, rather than utility
tokens, which are not prone to fraud. ICO regulation is still under development in most countries
including Australia, Canada, and France. Countries that have already developed and
implemented ICO regulations are the United States, United Arab Emirates, Switzerland,
Gibraltar, and New Zealand. In China and South Korea, all ICOs have been banned completely.
Owing to the difference in regulations per country, ICO investors must analyze which countries
to sell their coins or tokens in based on set regulations, therefore increasing the complexity in
trading cryptocurrencies. Prospective purchasers of cryptocurrencies also need to understand
regulations in each country before engaging in any transactions.
The Gibraltar British Overseas Territory Financial Service Commission is in the processes of
developing a framework to implement a worldwide regulation governing cryptocurrency
transaction to eliminate the complexity of transactions due to different regulations in each
country. Investing in cryptocurrencies and Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) is highly risky and
speculative. Investors should be careful not to get scammed by identifying exit scams early
enough using the key points we have mentioned above. Additionally, Multi-Level Marketing
Systems should totally be avoided as they are fraudulent ways to benefit initial investors.
Whether the development and implementation of regulations will help curb scammers in the ICO
world, time will tell.
Chapter Five: Wrapping It Up
If you had purchased $100 of BTC on Jan 1, 2011, it would have cost you $0.30 per BTC,
amounting to 333.33BTC. Seven years on and BTC has hit an all-time high of $11k, exchanging
at $9,315.28at the time of writing. Assuming you had kept your 333.33 BTC, they would be
worth an incredible $3 million today. That is not a bad return for a $100 initial investment. Just
like BTC, Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) may have similar profits, butonly if carefully traded. In
this chapter, we are going to discuss stages and tips in investing in ICOs.
Step in ICO Trading
1. Research Extensively on Upcoming ICOs
Extensive research is vital in ICO trading since it is the only means by which an investor
is guaranteed a return on his or her investment. An investor should look at resources or
outlets that feature the latest ICOs. Knowing which ICOs are coming up will enable an
investor to plan, especially for ICOs that have a whitelist. A whitelist ICO enables
prospective investors to register in advance to participate in the ICOs, which are usually
hallmarks of popular ICOs that have a limited number of coins to offer. The best
websites to research upcoming ICOs are Top ICO List and ICO watchlist. At the time of
writing, Top ICO List had placed TRIPBIT, COTI, and Qurrex as the top lucrative
upcoming ICOs to invest in, while ICO watchlist had noted Payera, Xsolus,and Global
Reit as the top upcoming ICOs. Therefore, prospective investors should carry out
extensive research before deciding on which ICO to invest in.
2. Act Diligently
In the previous chapter, we discussed how ICOs are prone to frauds such as exit scams
and Multi-Level Marketing Systems. Due to this reason, investors should perform their
own research to ascertain that an ICO is a good and credible project and hence avoid
being defrauded of their hard-earned investments. Research done should involve reading
reviews and analysis done by others to verify the potential of the ICO. There are so
many good ICO review resources that can be accessed at Crush Crypto and Reddit
websites.
3. ICO Participation Process
The ICO participation process entails three main steps.
a. Opening an Exchange Account
After extensive research and assurance in the credibility of an ICO, the next step
is to open an exchange account to participate in the ICO process. The account
should be able to accept fiat cryptocurrency to convert the domestic fiat currency
into popular cryptocurrenciessuch as Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum(ETH).
b. Opening a Wallet Account
A wallet is essential to participate in an ICO. Participating in an ICO requires an
investor to send BTC and ETH from their personal, private wallets. If they send it
from an exchange, they will not be able to access the ICO tokens since the
transfer originates from the wallet of exchange and, technically, they do not own
any wallets in an exchange. Note, exchange accounts such as Poloniex, Bittrex,
and Kraken are not personal wallets. There are numerous wallets available but the
most recommended wallet is MyEtherWallet (MEW).
c. Follow the ICO Instructions to Trade
In most ICO trading platforms, a step-by-step guide to participating in the ICO is
usually provided. A means of communication is also provided for the latest
updates and to answer questions in real-time. Investors should ensure they follow
the instructions to participate correctly.
4. Exchange to Trade ICO Coins
You should exchange coins to make substantial profits. You can hold coins for the
medium- to long-term, depending on your price target i.e. (two times, three times,10x
the capital. Alternatively, you could just flip the coin and sell it once it reaches an
exchange that usually lists an ICO. Also, if you missed out, an ICO can be bought at an
exchange.ICO coins can be listed on various platforms such as Ether Delta, Bittrex,
Poloniex, and Binance.
Tips on Trading ICO Coins
After you’ve opened an account, let’s now go over some of the essential tips in trading ICO
coins for maximum profits.
Have a Reason for Entering each Trade
You should only start a trade when you know why you are starting and have a clear
strategy afterward. Not all traders make gains from trading since the trade is a two-way
traffic, i.e. for everyone who benefits, someone else loses on the other side. You should
also understand the risk involved in trading and the risk of costly mistakes.
Focus on Coins that are on Reputable Sites
Coins from reputable sites guarantee you of their credibility. Trading in non-reputable
coins is risky as they are associated with fraudulent schemes to extort traders of their
hard-earned investments. As discussed above, sites such as Top ICO list and ICO
Watchlist are renowned for dealing with credible coins.
Target and Stop when Starting a Trade
For each trade, you must set a clear target level for making a profit and more
importantly, a stop-loss level for cutting losses where the trade will be closed. It is
important to consider several factors when choosing a stop-loss level correctly. Most
traders end up taking huge loses because they are unsure of the top level.
Do not put all Your Eggs in one Basket.
To be a profitable trader, you must manage your risk by looking at the peak of the
movement. You should look for small profits which will eventually accumulate to large
profits. You should spread your risk across your portfolio. For example, you should
never invest more than a small percentage of your portfolio in a non-liquid market with
very high risk. Also, invest with various cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Altcoins
which have inverse relationships, i.e. when the value of the Bitcoin rises then Altcoins
lose their value against Bitcoin and vice versa. In this way, you are guaranteed a profit
in the volatile market common with Bitcoins.
Secure Bonus Tokens
Most ICOs tend to offer some sort of bonus to incentivize investors to contribute early.
For the LiveEdu pre-ICO, for instance, there was a minimum required investment of $3.
However, investing $50 or more qualified you for a bonus of at least 25 percent. Savvy
investors should look to get involved in ICOs from the pre-ICO stage. If you can get a
bonus, then you will receive extra tokens for your initial investment.
Hold, Sell, Hold Some More
This is a very good idea to increase your investments. For instance, on receiving your
tokens, it is wise to exchange them for other cryptocurrencies such as ETC or BTC. The
cryptocurrency market is highly volatile and dynamic and you can release a higher
return on investment.
Set Goals and Place Sell Orders
Always set your goals by placing sell orders. A successful strategy regarding this is
placing very low buy orders. For instance, the Augor coin was down to 25 percent of its
value. After a short while, the market recovered slightly and anyone who had low buy
these low orders could easily double or triple their investment. Placing buy orders
requires special care .Do not wake up when you are far away from the market to find
your buy order is suddenly higher than the current market price!
Buy the Rumor, Sell the News
ICO trading requires you to always be informed on the current trends. When major news
sites publish articles, it is usually at exactly the right time to actually get out of the trade
and you will realize an immense return on investment.
Enjoy the Investment Process
Enjoy the dynamism of the whole investment process and this will enable you to put
your ego aside, which is necessary for making profits. The goal here is not to be right on
your trades, but to make a profit. Do not waste resources (time and money) to try to
prove that you should have entered that trade. Remember, there is no trader who never
loses at least sometimes. The equation is simple—get the total profits to be higher than
the total losses.
Keep It Simple
While investing in ICOs, it is important to minimize over thinking and the worry of
losing your hard-earned investments. Also, think critically about the most suitable ICO
investment for you after extensive research.
Conclusion
I hope this book will clearly guide you as you make your next investment step in the ICO world.
Always remember to be extremely careful when investing in ICOs as they can be fraudulent
schemes. ICOs provide a means by which startups avoid the costs of regulatory compliance and
intermediaries, such as venture capitalists, banks, and stock exchanges. Therefore, they can be a
great means to start a company.
Cryptocurrency 101
Introduction
This book is about trading Cryptocurrencies. The premise is that you are new to cryptos. As
such, we will take you through a comprehensive introduction to what it is, how it works, and
from there you will be able to understand the material on how to trade it.
Cryptocurrencies use a number of terms in the common analog-age lexicon. From the term ‘coin’
to the term ‘blockchains,’ to even the concept of ‘payment’ and ‘ownership,’ and seemingly
unrelated terms like ‘mining’. I will tell you here and now, none of these terms are used in the
way they used to mean, and you will see why in just a moment.
We will show you what they really mean and put you on the path to understanding how to trade
these coins, and what instruments you can use to approach this market with competence and
confidence.
We will also show you how to look for opportunities and even use algorithms to trade rapidly,
instead of manually clicking the buy or sell button, or manually drawing lines and charts to
anticipate movements. We will show you how it works, but we will also explore the software
that can do it at lightning speed.
Why would you want to trade Cryptocurrencies?
It’s not because it is the latest craze, but because it is the latest money-making potential that
rivals the early days of Wall Street, and the Forex market. It is a market that naturally lends itself
to electronic trades, and thereby makes entry and exit fluid and efficient. Can you lose money on
this? Sure you can. Nothing is guaranteed and, in fact, not only is it not guaranteed, the chances
of you losing money trading cryptos is very high if you do not know what you are doing.
That is the perspective we are going to take in this book. We are going to come at it from the
perspective of losing money and set up all the necessary tools, strategies, and skills needed to
prevent that from happening. That way we have the necessary skills to keep the hard deck.
Once you learn how not to lose money on every trade, you can start to look at the strategies
needed to navigate the market and the sentiment. The final step is to get one of two things –
either the gut instinct to know a trade in real-time, or to have your AI module trained so well that
you can almost fly hands-off.
The central aspect of this book is to get you trading as fast as possible, and to do that you have to
get familiar with a load of information, then internalize it so that you can be quick on the draw.
With that in mind, we are going to cover the basics in Chapter One. Once you have an idea of
those basics, then we will look at the basics of trading in terms of the where and the how. This is
so you will get an idea of how to open an account and what you need to look out for in all the
infrastructure to begin trading.
In the third chapter, we will look at the tools you will need. This chapter takes it slow. Here we
will look at the basic tools and show you how to hand-fly easy trades.
In the fourth chapter, we will look at conducting day trades and the different statistical indicators
that will give you rudimentary buy and sell signals. I will share with you the ones that have
brought me success, if used correctly. They need tweaking, and that is part of your growth as a
day trader.
In the fifth chapter we will look at automated trading software and how to deploy it. What I am
most interested to share with you in the latter part of the chapter is the use of AI in developing
auto traders for cryptos. Cryptocurrencies are perfectly suited for this, and you should use the
latter part of chapter five as a launch pad for looking at AI as a path toward trading all the
various cryptos.
While we are at it, let me just add one basic point about getting a wallet. There are three ways
you can do this. You can either get straight to an exchange, pick one and open an account. They
will give you the option of keeping all your coins with them online. The second way is by
downloading a wallet and keeping your coins in that wallet and moving them to the exchange as
and when you need them. Finally, get a small device and load the wallet software on to that, and
then transfer what you need to the desktop or laptop that you are trading on as and when you
need it.
Let’s be clear about wallets. The wallet only does one thing of primary importance (it does other
things under the hood too, but they are not important for the trading aspect of cryptos). It keeps
the private keys that you have for the address safe and private. In this regard, there are a few
things you must understand. It is not only important where you keep your Private Key. It is also
important that you don’t allow accidental duplication of it. So, for instance, if you are using a
wireless system at home, do make sure that you do not transact over that Wi-Fi network because
anyone who understands that you are doing this can do what is called a Man in The Middle
(MITM) attack, and copy all traffic that is passing through your router. Just keep that in mind.
The next thing is to make sure that you have multiple addresses. A wallet is an app that can hold
multiple addresses, and those addresses each have a private key, which you’ll need to be able to
spend your coin. Create an address for groups of coins and once you have all your coins put into
multiple addresses, take what you are not using offline.
When you open your account, it is possible to place all your coins at the exchange. The exchange
will keep your coins in a safe wallet, and when you want to withdraw it, you must let them know.
In some cases, the withdrawal is instant. In other cases, you may have to wait for a short period.
You have to know that keeping your coins in a third-party-controlled wallet is never a good idea,
in my opinion. If you can create the necessary measures in your setup, then you will not need to
worry about being hacked.
So now that you have an overview of the book, let’s dig in and get started.
CHAPTER 1: Fundamentals of Cryptocurrencies
Before we get to trading, let’s start with the basics and understand what cryptocurrency is first.
Cryptocurrency, or crypto for short, is an electronic form of currency that allows the
transmission of value between two nodes on a network. There are two specific networks that you
should get familiar with, because they are currently the most widely known and the ones with the
most activity. Fair warning: that could change over time. But as long as you understand the
basics, it doesn’t matter what the branding is. The first network is the Bitcoin network and the
second is the Ethereum network.
What do coins and currencies have to do with networks? Think of Bitcoin and Ethereum as two
individual networks. Although they comprise of thousands of nodes and hundreds and thousands
of users, the ecosystem is a closed loop. The coins never actually leave the network and that
network is defined by the existence of nodes.
Nodes
Nodes are computers that are part of the network. To become a node, users download and install
the relevant software. The software itself is free, and once installed it opens up a port on the host
computer and automatically connects it to a number of other nodes within the network. Each
node connects directly to any node in the network, usually only around six at a time. At the last
count, there were almost 12,000 of these nodes and each node connects to six others. It may not
seem like much, but if you wanted to send a message to the entire network, all you have to do is
send it to the six you are connected to and they will relay it to the six each of them is connected
to and those nodes will relay that message on, and within 5 to 6 hops, your message will have
spread to all 12000 nodes.
Why are messages important? Because the message is the root of the transaction. We will look at
the transaction next.
Transaction
The transaction needs to have two elements to it to make it legitimate. First it needs witnesses,
and second it needs a reason. A reason is typically, within the Bitcoin network, the movement of
tokens from the sender to the receiver. The sender initiates a message on the network messaging
system and sends it to the receiver’s address.
Imagine if I send you a letter saying that I will give you a dollar and everyone in this town is a
witness to that. There is no way of reversing that transaction. The promise is irrevocable. The
transaction in Ether or Bitcoin is as simple as that. To initiate a transaction, the sender must have
the funds and he must send the message. When he has the funds and sends a message, so that all
the nodes bear witness to it, that transaction is legitimized.
Transaction Value
The value of the transaction can be any amount. If it’s Bitcoin, it can be as small as 100 millionth
of one Bitcoin (0.00000001). That is the smallest value that the messaging system recognizes. It
is also called 1 Satoshi (in honor of the person who developed the Bitcoin system). The largest
amount is whatever amount you have in that wallet, and you can have as many wallets as you
like.
Wallets
Wallets are not the kind that you place in your pocket. On the surface, the wallet is the mailbox
that holds the coins that you receive in a message. When you send a message out as part of a
transaction, it will come from this mailbox – specifically called an address. If that address (we
called it mailbox here for recognition of concept) has previously received coins, then it has the
ability to spend those coins. If it has no coins, that address will not be able to send out a
transaction message.
A wallet is really an app installed on your device (computer or mobile device) that looks across
all the transactions and finds out which transactions in the entire ledger relate to that address. All
transactions are categorized as either incoming or outgoing. It adds up all the incoming
transactions, and then it separately adds up all the outgoing transactions, and the difference
results in your account balance – or the maximum amount that you can transact out.
The only other thing that you need to know is the difference between hot and cold wallets. Hot
wallets are ones that are constantly connected to the Internet and accessible at any time. Cold
Wallets on the other hand are ones that are not online and can’t be accessed via the internet.
The Coin
It’s hard to wrap one’s mind around the concept of the coin, or the crypto coin as it is also
known. The reason is psychological. We see it as a coin because coins represent tangible
currency in our mind. It gives us a frame of reference as a vessel of value. When we mention a
coin, it wraps our mind around a new concept using old and familiar vernacular. But the coin in
the crypto economy is nothing like the coin we think of that is typically round and flat with
engravings on both sides. In fact, all the images you see online that represent Bitcoin as a golden
circular coin are merely imaginary. It does not look anything like that.
Some even think of the coin as a string of bits – ones and zeros of binary computer language. But
it’s not. There is no physical coin, and there is not an electric coin either. In fact the coin is not
even cryptographic. I know that this goes against all you have heard, but hang in there, you will
see what it is in a minute. What it really is, is a cryptographic intra-network messaging system
that cannot be forged or hacked. The key to why it can’t be forged or hacked is because it is
based on a transparent and decentralized system that is encrypted – more on the encryption and
security in the next section.
The coin merely represents an irrevocable act of paying a certain value that is mentioned in the
message. And because this is a trustless system, that promise is instantly verified by the system,
which knows if the address from where the message is being sent has enough value to be
transmitted. It is that value that is described as a coin.
In essence, crypto coin trading is as efficient and pure as it gets, because you are trading our
purchasing value. But because it is hard for most people, who are not deeply familiar with the
inner workings of the system, the term ‘coin’ gives them a sense of comfort by referring them to
the objectification of the value that is being transmitted.
For the promise to have value, it must have been derived from value. You cannot just take
something and arbitrarily bestow value upon it. Before it can have market value or face value, it
must first have some form of intrinsic value. Without that the value is untradeable. You must
understand this at the core of your foray into crypto-economics and cryptocurrency trading.
The intrinsic value the ‘coin’ gets is derived from the physical labor that is performed to bring
that ‘coin’ into existence. Resources need to be spent, and effort needs to be applied in creating
each ‘coin,’ and that is why it is referred to as mining. Just as precious metals need to be
physically mined, cryptographic value needs to be created by the expense of computational
resources and cryptographic processes, and this is done by mining. The next section will describe
the mining process.
Essentially, then, coins are brought to life as a reward for the mining process, which requires the
expense of resource and cannot be derived for free. It is the nature of the Bitcoin system. In
Ethereum, the expense of bringing a coin into existence is done by the expense of resources as
well, but they will be converting from the Proof of Work model to the Proof of Stake model in
the coming months, barring any unforeseen changes. Either way, a value of some sort needs to
be applied.
Once the coin is received by the person who expends this effort, he has the ability to spend it any
way he wants. He can even give it away for free or he can use it as consideration for any product
or service, as long as the recipient is willing to accept it. But let’s look at that carefully for a
minute.
The person who receives it from the system is called the miner, and we will explain that next, but
for now, just know that in return for his mining, the system gives him and only him a certain
number of coins (remember that coins in this context is just a value with no physical features).
When he spends that coin, he can only do it within the network. Of course, he can purchase
whatever he wants, as long as the person he is buying from is within the network and has a valid
address to receive that payment.
So now that value expended during the mining can be exchanged for anything and it is done so
by a message that forms the transaction.
When you trade, that is what you are trading. That is what is called a coin.
Mining
Mining is discussed in this book for two reasons. The first is that it gives you an opportunity to
invest in Cryptocurrencies in the form of mining. Even though you are interested in trading,
mining is a form of investment in cryptos that are worth thinking about because the cost of
mining has only a few factor inputs: electricity to run the computers, purchase of the computers,
and the software and whatever labor costs the miner needs to perform the tasks. The hardware
costs are typically one-off (there are also replacement costs, because the processors can burn out
and might need replacing). Once you acquire the coins in this way, you can then use them to
trade. That’s one way of doing it. But not everyone wants to get knee-deep in the process. For
those folks, we advise just getting to the exchange and starting your trading from there.
We mentioned earlier that mining is the process that brings the coins to life. But now we are
going to look closely at what that is. In the next section, we will talk about the blockchain and
what it is, but for now, just know that it exists.
While mining efforts result in rewards in the form of coins, the actual mining is the process of
computation. In other words, mining is just really a ring of millions of computations to solve a
puzzle. The first one to solve that puzzle will be awarded the coin. Thus, the question here is:
what is the puzzle?
Without going in too deep, the puzzle relates to hashing. Hashing is a branch of mathematical
cryptography that uses a one-way function that is deterministic. That means if I took a word and
hashed it, I would get an unpredictable sequence of characters that cannot be reverse engineered.
I could take this entire book and hash it and what I will get is a string of characters that look like
this (this is the hash of the following sentence: The rise and fall of the Roman Empire):
5C94D7845A6A2163D39CA32A0D19122C6B95FA591CF58636DBEBB475EDA4A160
That hash is so unbreakable that even if I were to change one letter, or even the capitalization of
that letter, see how the entire hash changes. I will hash the same sentence but with a minor
change: the rise and fall of the Roman Empire. In this case, if you notice, the first alphabet has
been changed to a lowercase.
AFC44E6D243443A56A2D65357FA98EA61A6A5997BD2975C4435B9A4BCCCFB763
If you observe the two hashes, they look very different. There is no way you could reverse
engineer it, even if you knew how it was hashed.
Now remember, these are just the basic parts of hashing. If you want to know more, there are
numerous books that you can get to understand the hashing and cryptographic process in deeper
detail.
Back to mining.
Every time a transaction is completed (a message to send coin from one account to another is
broadcast through the network) two things happen. The first, is the nodes that receive the
broadcast check to see if it is a valid transaction – specifically they see if the sender has a
sufficient balance. The second thing they do is confirm if the message is properly formatted and
all the details are present. There are about 16 checks that the nodes execute, and if all is okay,
they place the transaction in a queue. At this point the transfer of value is not yet confirmed.
There are hundreds of these messages on an hourly basis in the queue.
The next thing that happens is the miners pull all these transactions (they take the transaction
IDs) and put them together and hash them. There is a specific way to hash them and it has to
include a few things. It needs to include the TXIDs, the header, the hash of the last block, and
one more item called a nonce.
This nonce is a random number, but this is where the puzzle that needs to be solved comes into
play. If you take all the information that goes into the block and run the hash function, it will
result in a specific string of characters – just as the sentence “The rise and fall of the Roman
Empire” above did.
Now look at the sentence again, and the corresponding hash for it:
the rise and fall of the Roman Empire
AFC44E6D243443A56A2D65357FA98EA61A6A5997BD2975C4435B9A4BCCCFB763
The rule is that you can’t change any part of the sentence, but you can add random characters
after it. With that in mind, what if I told you that the puzzle was to find the hash that started with
the character 0 (zero)? Since you can’t reverse engineer the hash, you have to randomly keep
trying with different strings of characters that you can append to the sentence to make the hash
start with 0. It would look something like this:
the rise and fall of the Roman Empire 5134525
52CBF3DF5DFA63DA68F55AA5BC321F36597E53D96001B5D1E14668DE79F444E7
This wouldn’t work because the resulting hash didn’t begin with 0 as the system required.
The next try:
the rise and fall of the Roman Empire 4749q0r58tj
423C9570BC80747EC346626C8049208DBA52753BA303516817D9CFC6390D1D10
This didn’t work either. But just to make the point, after a few hundred tries the random number
that worked was this:
the rise and fall of the Roman Empire 090989897934
Which resulted in the hash as below:
0C3EE05D5788E2FD0DFE4D49AE6109A1AFE36523F0D99ED6DC48A4ECF8681622
That hash satisfied the requirement, and as such, the puzzle is solved.
Once the puzzle is solved, the coins are awarded to the miner that solved the puzzle and all the
transactions that were included are now said to be part of a block with a specific hash. That hash
becomes part of the record and can never be altered. If the block can’t be altered (because if you
alter the block, the hash would change, and the system would know that there was a problem and
reject that block) then the transactions within it can’t be altered, either.
Once that block is confirmed, all the transactions in that block are confirmed and the person who
received a payment will now see that his payment is confirmed. So, on one side, the mining
keeps the integrity of the coins, and on the other side, it generates more coins into the system.
You can’t change any of the transaction IDs without changing the hash. This keeps the whole
thing secure.
Blockchain
In the last section we talked, in passing, of a Blockchain. Now, it is time to look at that in a little
more detail. If you notice that the messages that the sender initiates are not just sent to the
address he is sending the coin to, he sends it to all nodes in the network – via the six (or more)
nodes he is directly connected to. In just a few seconds that message reverberates across the
entire network and all the nodes take note of that message. Once that message is released, and
the rest of the nodes bear witness to it, the nodes now deem that the recipient is now the owner of
more coins, and that the sender has less.
Let’s put this to use in an example.
Let’s say Andy wants to pay Bob 1 BTC (BTC = Bitcoin) for whatever reason, which is
immaterial to the network. Bob creates a wallet and gets an address. That address belongs to him
and it comes with a Private Key. In the meantime, Andy, who already has his address, Private
Key, and some Bitcoin in his wallet, takes Bob’s address from him and broadcasts a message to
the entire network that he is sending Bob 1 BTC. You’ve already seen how that is then placed in
blocks.
Once it is placed in a block, the entire block is hashed, and that is then placed inside the next
block and the miner proceeds to solve the puzzle. Once the puzzle is solved, that hash is then
placed in the next block of transactions, and so on it goes.
That results in an unbreakable chain. Once the transaction is confirmed, it cannot be canceled or
reversed. It lives forever, because a change in even one digit will change the hash, and that
change in hash will not jive with the hash that is already recorded in the preceding block.
This blockchain record is kept on all full nodes. That means there are thousands of records of this
blockchain, which means it can’t be altered.
The fundamentals of Cryptocurrencies in this chapter looked primarily at Bitcoin and to a brief
extent, Ethereum. But all cryptos have some form of mechanism that is similar. All of them have
the same concept but execute it differently, and by that you get different coins and networks.
The volume of coin demanded and the supply at any given point give rise to a value, and that
value is made more fluid and the asset is made more liquid by a vibrant market. Trading in
Cryptocurrencies is a three-dimensional proposition. You can either trade fiats for cryptos, or
you can trade one crypto for another. We will get into those details in the next chapter.
Buckle up!
CHAPTER 2: Basics of Trading
Trading cryptos is simple. You buy one of many existing Cryptocurrencies that are offered by
the exchanges. There are a number of exchanges that exist in the US and in other parts of the
world. Before you think about where you want to open an account, here is what you need to
consider.
The first thing is that you need to open an account. If you prefer, you can open an account in a
location that is not going to impose a tax liability on you in any jurisdiction. So this deserves
some study. This book is not going to give you tax advice, but you should know that there are
jurisdictions that will consider profits from Bitcoin trading to be taxable. If you look at it as a
currency, and that it is not legal sovereign tender, then it is tempting to think that it is not taxable.
This is wrong. Most tax jurisdictions do not differentiate the underlying asset when accounting
for profit.
The other thing that people are quick to assume is that Bitcoin transactions are anonymous. Well,
they are to a limited extent. But there are easy ways to see who owns what, unless you go
through extreme measures to protect it. When people say that Bitcoin is usually used by the
shady elements to hide their activities, they don’t really know what they are talking about.
Exchanges
There are more than a hundred exchanges that you can get on to be able to trade the currencies
that we talk about in this book. We will stick to one hundred, and you can look at each one of
them to see which ones you would like to pick. You should have at least 10 exchanges in your
basket, and you should use the ones that allow you to keep your coins wherever you please and
transfer to them only when your trades are open, find an exchange that is quick with withdrawals
and an exchange that executes rapidly without the need for brokers. Brokers work against your
interests because they cost more and they are unable to execute rapid trades. Here is a list of

Market
If you want to trade cryptos actively, it is not a difficult process once you get your fundamental
study and technical study internalized. There are few, if any, regulations on it that you need to
abide by, and as long as you do not engage in fraud or theft, and you conduct yourself equitably,
you won’t need to keep looking over your shoulder.
Remember that cryptos are not physical assets like shares of companies, or fiat currencies that
have the legal sovereign banking system – and then further substantiated by other countries, and
by the world’s banking institutions. Currencies have that, cryptos don’t. So that is the first risk
that you need to keep way back in your mind. What’s the worst that can happen to cryptos? They
could be outlawed around the world. The chance of that happening is low, but nonetheless it
exists. In our case, that is a good thing because it adds to the push and pull of the market,
creating opportunities to buy and sell. It is also one of the reasons you should not keep an open
position overnight.
More importantly, unlike shares and currency, they are not physical assets that can be held and
kept – cryptos are not physical in any form. These are conceptual assets, and as we advance as a
society we will see that cryptos will end up being the most efficient currency in use. Imagine a
time when we eventually reach space and have colonies – cryptos would be an ideal way to
facilitate commerce.
Up until this point, what we have been looking at has been the ecosystem of the crypto economy
– specifically the cryptocurrency. That gives us the basic knowledge to start understanding the
factors that come into play for the market that we are interested in. Our next goal is to look at the
market. I will compare the crypto market to traditional financial markets, if necessary.
The first thing you need to know is that the crypto market is not centrally regulated. That means
there are no rules yet on what you can and can’t do, but there are limitations as to what is
acceptable in the marketplace. You can trade manually, you can use program trading, and you
can even use artificial intelligence.
There are no rules, and that makes it a very lucrative opportunity if you do three things. The first
is make sure you understand the basics. Second, start small – the minimum trading size for a few
exchanges is 0.001 BTC. You need to get the feel for how things happen, and that gets your
confidence and experience up. The third is that you do not stop at plain vanilla trades. If you just
want to get into it and trade one or two times a day with plain vanilla trades, then this is not
something that you will succeed at in the way that you imagine. Bottom line: start small and
crank it up.
I hear many would-be traders complain that the Bitcoin market is volatile. It is, but that is a good
thing. There are two kinds of volatility. One where there is high volume (and the volatility is
driven by a different factor) and the other where there is insufficient volume.
Tradability
Bitcoin is not the only crypto out there that you can trade. And the USD is not the only fiat that
you can trade that against. There are over 1000 cryptos in the market today and over 100 fiats
that are worth trading. However, mastering all those pairings creates a nightmare. You should
focus on just a few. In my experience, the US Dollar, the Japanese Yen, and the Euro are your
best fiats to be traded against cryptos. Among the cryptos, aside from Bitcoin, which is the
obvious trading opportunity, there are eight alternatives you can choose from as follows:
Ethereum, Litecoin, NEM, Dash, Ripple, Ethereum Classic, Monero, and Zcash.
That gives you more than 50 possible trading pairs - USD v BTC, USD v ETH, USD v NEM,
and so on. It may seem like a wide field to choose from, but let me tell you that, as a beginner, it
is indeed too many. As a manual trader, it will be completely overwhelming for you to
understand, track, and execute the entry and exits of each pair.
To effectively choose the pairing, you need to be intimately familiar with the nature of the
individual currency and the nature of their pairing. To do this you need to observe and
understand the critical factors of tradability and liquidity.
Tradability is a combination of volatility and breadth. Volatility is the frequency of movement
that it makes in a given period of time, and breadth is about the gap between the movement of
the price’s high and low. You need both to make it tradable. Tradability is a lot different from
buying and holding for future profit. That does not require the higher frequency movements. On
the other hand, if there is no breadth, then it will be hard to enter and exit the market profitably,
since there are spreads that you need to consider. For instance, if you are looking at a pairing
between A and B, the exchange rate is 1:1.9. In actuality, the rate is spread between 1.85 and
1.95. Your buy price would be 1.95 in this example and your sell price would be 1.85. This
spread would cause you to lose 0.1 if you were to do an instant entry and exit. The point of
highlighting this is to show you that, even if the price didn’t move, if you entered and exited
within moments, you would still lose the spread.
Because of this, breadth of movement is important, especially if you want to do fast trades,
which cryptos are capable of. You want to be able to have it move at least across the spread and
cover your fees and other costs, and if that happened, you could scalp the market many times
during the day and make a tidy profit. We will look at this again later.
The way volatility helps is that it gives you many opportunities to trade in a day. You need to
think about trading as a two-way street, and not as you would if you were buying stocks. In this
two-way street, you are exchanging one currency for another. And so, if you think that BTC v
ETH is rapidly fluctuating, that means the BTC will rise against ETH and then fall back. When
BTC falls back against ETH, it means the ETH is momentarily appreciating. Your opportunity
comes from riding those ups and downs.
If an asset is not volatile, it may be a great asset to purchase for the long-term, but it won’t be a
good candidate to trade rapidly or day trade – which is what you want to do with cryptos. Try not
to leave a position overnight when it comes to these assets. It is too high a risk to leave open
positions unattended – unless you are doing program trading or using AI.
The crypto market is unlike the stock market. If they are not volatile, they present no opportunity
to trade profitability – remember we are talking about trading here. Buying an asset for long-term
appreciation is not covered in this discussion.
On the other hand, if they are too volatile, they present reduced security and predictability to
trade. So a balance must exist in the level of volatility. These untenable volatile situations arise
due to volume. If the volume is low, prices tend to be volatile but they are not tradable. This is
because the price fluctuates too rapidly to allow the entry into the market to be predictable, and
then once in, it becomes too difficult to exit the market effectively. The average volume is a key
factor in accepting the volatility pattern of the asset. This leads us to liquidity – the second of the
two factors we mentioned.
What is liquidity?
Liquidity has to do to with volume and efficiency. You can think of it as friction. If you get into
an asset, you want it to be as frictionless as possible. That means you get in when you want to
and you get out when you want to. There are a few situations that may make that untenable. One
scenario that could happen is when everyone wants to sell, you will find that there are no buyers
– that’s not a liquid market. You may discover that finding a seller or finding a buyer is not easy
because there is lackluster interest in the asset; or you may find that there are not enough
exchanges supporting the market, which reduces the potential trader’s access to that asset. These
are just a few ways the asset is illiquid – there are more. But you get the point. When you
consider an asset, you need to assess its liquidity and its volatility. Liquidity without volatility
does not give you tradability, while volatility without liquidity doesn’t give you predictability.
This is partially the reason Bitcoin is more valuable and in demand than its alternatives and the
USD-BTC pair is a popular investment tool for day traders. It is also because there is sufficient
liquidity to make your trades almost seamless and efficient. This is called a liquidity premium,
and it is one that you should be willing to pay, as the payoff is worth it.
But that is a fiat-crypto pair (meaning it is the trade between a fiat currency and a
cryptocurrency). What about a crypto-crypto pair? Well, there are several large volume and
liquid pairs that you can work with. One such pair is the BTC-ETH pair.
With respect to tradability, you should have your basket well differentiated between fiat-cryptos
and crypto-cryptos, and even have a basket that is fiat-crypto-fiat or crypto-fiat-crypto, or some
other three-way combination.
You want to be an expert in at least two or three combinations, and that expertise comes in the
form of study and practice. You have to study the fundamentals and you have to practice the art
of reading the charts. In the trading business these are called the fundamentals and the technical.
You have to study the fundamentals – which includes knowledge of the asset, how it works,
market sentiment, regulation, and analysis. On the other hand you have to know how to read the
charts. The charts and the analysis of the movement of price is a comprehensive mathematical
and statistical representation of the psychology of the market. It is fairly plausible to understand
where the market is moving in the future by looking at sufficient data from the past. That’s the
technical aspect of the analysis.
Become an expert at BTC vs Ethereum and BTC vs USD to start.
CHAPTER 3: Crypto Trading
There are two ways you can get into active trading. One has a cost advantage, so it is good to get
started with this. The second has an accuracy and professional advantage but the costs are
significantly higher. It’s not always a simple choice between one and the other, but rather a case
of growing from one and moving on to the next.
When you start off, it is best that you take the one that gives you the cost-benefit, this is
assuming that you start slowly. If your initial foray into the market is between 5 and 10 Bitcoin,
then going online would not be too obstructive. With that amount, you would probably conduct
between three and five trades per day (24 hours). In this case, the online exchanges are
absolutely fine.
The online exchanges and trading houses provide you with the ability to execute trades, as well
as use trading tools to find buy and sell points. A few of the reputable intermediaries have this,
and most of them are free if you place a certain minimum amount with them.
The other option is for you to stay away from the online trading platform and get the price feed
you need from the Bloomberg Terminal. Bloomberg now offers real-time quotes for most of the
major cryptos, and even some of the more recent ones. It is surprisingly extensive. When I first
started using it, they only had the USD-BTC pair and over the last few years they have added
most of the others. They also offer the ability to chart all the cryptos and even give you the
flexibility to program your strategy directly from your feed. My current setup pulls the real-time
feed from the terminal, which then gets fed into an AI algorithm that we have developed.
If you are considering taking this on with any level of seriousness, then you should not skimp on
the equipment that you are going to need. If you do decide to go the Bloomberg Terminal route,
then go ahead and get the T1 line put in as well. That way you are getting super-fast real-time
feeds on pricing.
If you end up doing trades that are rapid-fire, and if you use an online system, even if you do
have broadband, then you will end up having a lag time, which is not acceptable for any level of
serious trading.
When I got into trading, I had no choice but to do it online, but jumped to BT as soon as they
started to offer it. The speed of the T1 line and the accuracy of the prices allows me to execute
rapid turnarounds and trade higher volumes in a day and to have higher frequency of multiple
pairs. 90% of my trades are not manual, they are program trades, 5% are AI trades, and 5% are
manual trades.
When you do program trades, the programs are scanning for opportunities across the market at a
rate that is significantly more efficient than a human possibly could. This brings more trading
opportunities to my attention, which increases my volume and my profit potential. I suggest you
do the same.
Trading Strategies
There are three trading strategies introduced in this chapter. These strategies will form the
foundation of other strategies that you will surely get used to as you mature in your trading
abilities. This is assuming that you are new to cryptocurrency trading and have minimal
knowledge and understanding of what it is and how to do it.
Remember that this market moves constantly. Hardly a second that goes by when a trade is not
being conducted. With more than 50 pairs of currencies and fiats, trading can easily become a
full-time occupation.
Buy the Dips
Always remember to buy the dips. Dips are moments in the price movement that a march
forward is followed by a momentary step back. This is the characteristic of most markets. When
you are new to any market, it is an effective way to identify trends. When you are day trading,
trends are not what they would be if you were a long-term trader. A long-term trader considers a
trend to last anything from a few days to a few months, and enters his position and leaves it for
days, weeks, or even months. A scalper in cryptos or a day trader doesn’t do that. He actively
trades the waves, both up and down, and exits in minutes, or hours, at the most.
Since you are doing rapid trades, you can use the dips to get a better entry point once a mini-rally
has started. This is your first strategy. When you first get started, observe the graphical
representation of price movements. Don’t look at the numbers, as the numbers can’t give you an
image of the price as it takes shape. Watch the chart and adjust the timescale to 5 seconds, 10
seconds, and 1 minute to get an idea of the nature of the movement. You will notice that every
advance is punctuated by a retracement and every fall is retarded by a momentary uptick. Get
used to this patter and use it in your ability to buy the dip.
Never place an order as soon as the market turns from one trend to the next. Wait for the dip,
then buy on its next run. That way you can see the rally form rather than face the retracements
soon as you get in. It also gives you an opportunity to confirm the push forward. Use the dips as
a trigger for your market entry.
Do the same thing when you are shorting the market - wait for the dip. In this case, the dip means
that it is backing off its downward trend and momentarily ascending. Wait for it. When it reaches
its apex and starts back down, that’s when you catch it. Make it a habit to never try to catch it at
its peak. Fortune may grant a perfect catch while the price peaks, but it’s never a good long-term
habit to have.
The apex and the pit have a specific purpose, and that purpose is not for you to harvest or
liquidate, but for you to prepare for the next move. Those are your trigger points.
Arbitrage
This is an advanced strategy only as far as beginners go, but it is something that you should
master right away. Arbitrage doesn’t focus on the ups and downs of the market, but rather the
mispricing of the market. In cryptos, this is an underutilized strategy, and if nothing else, this is
the strategy you should take away from this book.
When there are so many pairings, your best bet is to use the automated programs that I use (as
described in the earlier part of this chapter). Without automation, you are not going to be able to
make use of the greatest benefit that cryptos provide – and that is tradability and volatility.
Back to arbitrage.
In arbitrage, the thing that you are looking for is a mismatch in price between pairs. So, let’s say
for instance you have the price of A vs B, price of B vs C, and the price of C vs A. If all goes
well, and the A:B is 1:2, B:C is 1:3, then it should be that A:C should be priced at 1:6. But in a
pricing mismatch, A (in this example) is bidding at 1:6.5. What happens in this case? Look at
how simple this is. If I use one unit of A to buy C, I get 6.5 in return. With 6.5, I can use C to
buy B at the rate of 1:3, which will get me 2.167 of B. With 2.167 of B I exchange that back into
A to get 1.08 of A. When I first started the arbitrage exercise, I walked in with only 1 unit of A
and I exited with 1.08 units of A. This example shows an 8% return. That’s not so important,
because the numbers are only examples. The point is that this trade would take just 30 seconds to
complete.
Now let’s look at how you set this up on your trading. Before I forget, there is something that
you should do on a daily basis. On any given day, there are numerous mispricing opportunities,
and you will not be able to catch all of them manually. You will need a program or an AI
algorithm to catch them and execute the trades. Just keep the program running and set it up to
either trade automatically, or to seek your approval prior to placing the trade.
If you don’t do this, there are a number of other traders who are going to do it. The fastest to
execute this gets the prize. The guys who trade on web-based portals are certainly not going to be
in the running. Because, to take advantage of this, you need extremely low-latency systems and
real-time data feeds. Your Bloomberg Terminal can do it, only if you are on a T1 line.
On Balance Volume
The two strategies you’ve seen so far are really enough to get you started, but here is a third one
that goes beyond just buying and selling when and if you ‘feel’ like it. The logic behind the first
one, on the surface, is designed to get you to identify market entry and market exit triggers. On a
deeper level it is designed to get you familiarized with the nature of price movements and the use
of charts to visualize them. The second strategy was arbitrage, and that was designed to get you
to profit off the mispricing of the market. That’s on the surface. From a deeper perspective, it is
designed to get you to open your mind to the different ways of taking advantage of the markets.
This last of the three strategies is designed to get you to see what the smart money is doing. By
using this strategy, you are keeping an eye on where all the money is flocking to. If you can get
comfortable with the movement of big money, then you can pretty much ride the trends and
scalp the fluctuations.
To do this you need an OBV indicator. Bloomberg has it preinstalled on the Terminal. Some
prominent MT4 for cryptos have it as well. OBV stands for On Balance Volume.
The OBV indicator gives you insight into how much money is flowing into any given position.
What happens when you see money pouring into a currency? You know that it is about to take
off. One of the things that you don’t normally see in the online or web-based trading platforms is
the volume of orders that are going in the pipeline. When you watch that with the OBV, what
you get is pretty good insight into where the market is going to tip at any given moment.
Conversely, what you can do, among other things, is watch where the market starts to lose steam,
and either get out of a position, switch counters, or short the asset. The possibilities of how to
read the market and what to do get pretty sophisticated once you start to get comfortable with the
OBV. But the two things that you absolutely must keep your eye on is the pending trades and the
OBV.
There is also something called the OBV mismatch, and it is a trade of the second order in the
sense that you are no longer just looking at the price of things to determine a trade; you are
looking at the effect of the activity around it that is measured by the OBV.
If you find that there is a mismatch between two cryptos, then you go to the price that they are
trading at and determine if the price of the cryptos are converging or diverging. If you find them
converging, then prepare yourself for a sell order. If they are diverging, do the opposite.
Chapter 4: Trading Indicators
Within the next decade, or less, trading in cryptos is going to be dominated by algorithms and
artificial intelligence. There is not much to dispute on that. We have already started to see that
equities and bonds have started using Quants (Quantitative Analysts). Quants in traditional
markets are similar to the technical traders we talked about earlier in the book when it comes to
trading cryptos. They essentially trade on statistical and mathematical strategies.
Don’t worry, you don’t need to be a mathematician to do any of this. What you do need to do is
get started now, so that when the time comes, and you want to remain competitive, you will be
able to understand what the technical analysis is and how the program you get into will be able to
assist you when trading cryptos. Remember that cryptos, more than anything else, naturally lend
themselves to program trading.
There are four market zones that you need to be aware of. The first one is the Japanese time
zone, which starts at about 8pm EST and ends at 4pm EST. During this time you get fair volume.
Then comes the Middle East Market, which opens at about midnight EST and stretches to 8am
EST. This overlaps with the European Market and stretches the active tomes to about 10am EST,
by which point the US east coast comes online and kicks up the volume, and that stretches all the
way to about 8pm EST due to the west coast.
Even though these are 24-hour, 7-day week markets, there are peak times that you need to be
aware of. If you are not using an AI to monitor the volumes, then you can just use these times in
your program to assume that these are the times – especially the times when there is an overlap
that there will be greater volume and better use of statistical and computational strategies.
Increased volume plus increased volatility make trading profitable, and that is a function of peak
overlap business hours.
Moving Averages
Whether you get a sophisticated system, or you decide to run the numbers by hand, you need to
start your technical education with the simplest and most effective tool that you will find. It is
called Moving Averages and you will see them denoted in forms like MA-30, MA-5 and so on.
MA of course stands for Moving Average. But the number that follows it represents the period
that the average is computed for. So MA-30 represents the moving average of prices over the last
30 periods.
Note that I wrote ‘periods’ and not days. The reason is that the time-scale is up to you. If you are
looking at short-term trades, then the time-scale can be as small as 30 seconds or a minute or
even 5 minutes. If your investment horizon is in the long-term, then you would use days. You
can even use them in conjunction to understand the longer trend and the short-term fluctuations.
For instance, you can use a 30-day moving average to get a feel for the long-term trend, and that
would give you y0ur bias. So, for instance if the trend indicated an up-swing, then you would
have a bias that the prices are going up, and that you should favor long (long is the term used to
indicate buy positions) positions. If the long-term trend is moving downward, then you should
have a bias for short positions (short is the term for selling).
Typically, you would use two long-term trends, let’s say an MA-35 and an MA-21 (I find that
using Fibonacci numbers gives better results). This timescale is measured in days. That will give
you the long-term bias. Then you can have the short-term indicators, like the MA3 and MA8.
These are measured in minutes. So, I take the price at the end of a minute, three times
consecutively, then add them up and divide it by 3. So, let’s say at 9:01am the price is 10. At
9.02am the price is at 10.5, and at 9.03am the price is at 10.8. You would take 9, 10.5, and 10.8
and add them up to get 30.3. Divide that by 3 (since it is three periods) and you will get 10.1. As
such, the MA3 is 30.1. You will then plot that line and superimpose that plot on the price chart.
What you will find is a smoothed out price movement chart. If you then superimpose the MA8,
which is the 8-period average, then you have two similar lines that tend to flow together.
The signal comes when one line crosses the other. When the MA3 is below the MA8, it indicates
a falling trend, and when the MA3 is above the MA8 it indicates a rising trend. This is your
short-term indicator.
The same happens with your long-term indicator. If the long-term indicator (the one measured in
days) shows a longer-term trend, this can form your extended bias. So, if the long-term trend is
set to rise, that is your long-bias. Thus, if you have a long-bias that is necessitated by the longer
MA, and the short-term trend indicated by the shorter MA, then what you have is a good position
to scalp the market in both directions whichever way it goes.
Here is how you do that.
If the long-term MA is a long bias, then you keep your eye on the fact that the market is poised
to turn up quickly, and so you start with a footing of a buy position. As soon as the short-term
indicator also shows a buy signal, then you jump into the market. The moment the short-term
indicator changes to the sell, then you liquidate that position, and enter a new short position. But
this second short position needs to be more sensitive. At the first indication of the short-term
changing back to the buy, you liquidate that position, reap the profit, and also enter a new buy
position. You keep doing this at every opportunity, especially when there is large volume in the
market during peak time. This indicator is most effective and accurate when the market is liquid.
This is a good indicator, and in unsophisticated markets is strong enough to be the only indicator
that you will need to profit from a market. If you start doing program trades, which you should,
then just use the test feature in the app to test the strategy on past price movements and observe
the trade signals. I have done this many times while programming the AI version of the trade
algorithm and the rapid-fire efficacy – which is to take every trade every time without hesitation.
Strict programmatic trading resulted in 81% accuracy of trades and a 27% return in a day. (this
was in test mode, not live market). That was the program trade version. In the AI version, we
programmed the engine (AI engine) to run millions of simulations until it found the best interval
and the most accurate signal. The results were better than expected, and it is one of the reasons I
mentioned earlier that crypto trading will be fully programmatic or AI-driven within the next
decade. So you might as well get on board now.
Exponential Moving Average
The EMA has a little more efficiency to it in certain markets, especially the BTC-USD rates. It is
exactly the same as the MA that we saw above, with the only difference being that there are
weights applied to different periods. The rationale behind this is that the number that are close to
the present moment in time should count more toward the average than a number that is much
further in the past. This calculation has its advantages and works well in BTC-ETH exchange,
and a couple of other crypto-crypto rates. It also works better in markets that are less volatile.
Less volatile markets tend to result in indicators that are too sensitive, which then results in a
higher incidence of false positives.
Here is how you do it:
Use a Fibonacci number again to choose the time horizon. Let’s say you take 13 periods. Apply a
weight of 1.3 to the most recent number, 1.1 to the number before that, 1 to the number before
that, and go all the way back to 0.1 for the first number in the sequence. So, let’s say the
following sequence is the price of the asset over the last 13 periods:
10,9,10,11,12,11,12,13,12,11,13,14,13
Multiply each number by its weight, like this:
10(0.1),9(0.2),10(0.3),11(0.4),12(0.5),11(0.6),12(0.7),13(0.8),12(0.9),11(1.0),13(1.1),14(1.2),13(1.3)
Then add up all those numbers
1+1.8+3+4.4+6+6.6+8.4+10.4+10.8+11+14.3+16.9 = 94.6
Then divide 94.6 by the sum of the weights, which is 9.1
So 94.6/9.1 = 10.39
You can play around with the weights of the prices to fine tune it to your favorite counter, but
you now get the picture. In case you were wondering, yes, you use two horizons—EMA 13 and
EMA21—and when they cross over, it indicates a trigger to purchase or sell.
When the faster of the two is above, then it is a buy, and when the slower is above it’s a sell
indication. You can use this in conjunction with the regular moving average for certain counters.
In my experience, it seems to work well with the less volatile pairings like Ethereum vs Ripple,
or Ripple vs Monero.
ADX Indicators
The final indicator that I want to introduce you to is the ADX. But before we get into that, I want
to impress upon you that the way to make money in crypto trading is not so much about
identifying the trends of a price movement. It is really about identifying turning points. You
make the most return in accurately picking the point where a turn is made in earnest – that means
you are able to look over the false positives. In trades you want to get in at the start of a run and
keep scalping the mini moves. That’s why a 24-hour market works so well, because the market
lends itself to constant data analysis. There are no sudden starts and stops – discontinuities that
leave risk to accumulate from the close of one session to the open of the next. I have said this in
an earlier part of the book. It is statistically more prudent to liquidate and square your positions
at the end of your trading day than to leave open positions unattended – especially when you do
not have a program or AI engine running your trades.
The ADX is a line chart that is plotted on the price chart. Typical price charts represent the
movement of the price in graphical presentation. Charts give you visual cues which are better to
work with manually, and conceptualize strategies for. But programs do not see things in chart
presentation, they see it in equations, variables and data. But for you and me, the visual
representation works well – like seeing the analog needle of your car’s speedometer is more
effective than seeing digital numbers.
You don’t need to know how to exactly calculate the ADX, because it is not something that is of
much use unless it is done in real-time to evaluate a trade, and most programs and web trading
portals provide it. Instead of showing you the long and tedious calculations, I think it will be
time well spent to describe its efficient use.
With the ADX plotting in real-time at the bottom of the chart and the moving averages
superimposed on to the price chart, what you get is one statistic backing up another. The ADX
shows you the momentum of the counter or the move. It goes between 0 and 100 and that
indicates the percentage of strength. Anything above 80 shows significant momentum in a
particular trend, and anything below 30 shows little (or none). When the ADX line breaks 30%
you can start to see a momentum build in the price and you can reconfirm this with the
overlapping MA. This gives you an assurance of the signals.
If you are thinking that this just sounds like more work for no additional payoff, I couldn’t agree
with you more. Where this really comes in hand is when you place this as part of a trading
program and the program automatically checks the momentum to determine if a trade is viable.
So, in the work up to running algorithms to signal your trades, you should get used to using the
ADX so that when the time comes you will be able to tweak the parameters to get better results
from the trade recommendations.
Chapter 5: Artificial Intelligence and Algorithms
This is going to be a short chapter because it is only intended to introduce you to AI and
programmatic trading. It is my strongest belief that you should get into AI trading, or at the very
least programmatic trading, as quickly as possible.
Many traders talk about the art of trading and getting a feel for the market before you actually get
into programs and algorithms. But I am in it for the money, and so are you, I assume.
In that case, the thing that you want to invest in, in addition to the T1 line and the Bloomberg
Terminal, is a comprehensive trading algorithm and an artificial intelligence platform. They may
seem like the same thing, but they are not at this juncture.
The algorithm is one where you can pull various data feeds and tell the program what you want it
to do, and it will do exactly what you tell it. If there is a mistake in the program, or the logic in
the concept is faulty, you will get suboptimal results and you will have to tweak it yourself over
time.
AI on the other hand is self-learning. If something is self-learning that means you get to tell it
what output you want, and if that output is wrong, it will continue to chew on the data to arrive at
predictions that are accurate.
The way we run our AI is to feed it millions of points of data and run specific instructions that it
will then look at and make a prediction, it will then look at the subsequent price data and see if
its predictions are correct. If they are, the program learns. If it’s wrong, it learns that as well, then
changes the parameters until it learns so far ahead that its predictions and strategies become
highly effective and accurate. That’s what you want. That takes time, as the market is constantly
evolving.
Within ten years you will get to the point that you can leave that program to do the trading while
you hang out with your pals and take on a new expensive hobby. After all, that’s the whole point
of AI, and crypto-economics and cryptocurrency trading are ideal markets to run AI.
Conclusion
The idea of this book is to give you an understanding of cryptos, how they work and how they
behave in market conditions. It also serves as a launching point for you to get the best trading
mindset and the understanding of what you should or shouldn’t do to make money in this market.
If you are planning to enter small, that’s fine, but make sure you have the infrastructure to
support your trades. Don’t just open a trading account and hit the buy or sell button based on
recommendations you find on random websites.
The trading of Cryptocurrencies is in its infancy, and it is the best time to get into it. The
convergence of AI and cryptos has made it a huge area of growth and wealth creation. I can’t
stress this enough, do not waste your time and resources on random accounts and trades. You
have to make this a focus and an endeavor. This is serious business and you should bring a
serious mindset to the table.
Whether you look at Bitcoin or Altcoins (Altcoins is the term given to all other cryptos that are
not Bitcoin) the trading strategies are the same. Their underlying blockchain may differ, but the
nature of the exchange and the way to profit from it remains identical.
Within your basket of investment, spend more time looking at Bitcoin and Ethereum, but also
have a healthy exposure to the other nine cryptos that we mentioned earlier in the book.
There will be more cryptos entering the market in the next few years, and then after that, you will
see a consolidation of several them and the attrition of a large number of tokens and other coins.
What you will see is the nature of evolution play out over the next ten years, and you will have a
front seat to it if you indeed get into this full-time.
Do not hesitate to invest in the infrastructure and get to know the nature of the market. It will
carry the day.
Blockchain Dynamics
Introduction
You can’t fully understand the workings of any cryptocurrency until you understand the
blockchain. That is the topic of this book which starts off conceptually – describing the Bitcoin
or cryptocurrency that rides on top of it, but slowly and rapidly looking at sufficient detail so that
you can get a good foundation in the functional aspect of blockchains.
For those of you who have heard so much (or not at all) about this thing called cryptocurrency,
but don’t really know what it is, let’s start there. A cryptocurrency is a form of currency where
you exchange it for goods and services. This exchange of goods and services for a payment of
some sort happens online. Happening online does not preclude it from happening in person. We
tend to think of them as being mutually exclusive, but, in actual fact, today’s technology has
made it possible for us to do instant transfers of payment in person using electronic methods and
without the need for using cash. Online payments are just as possible when standing face to face
with your counterpart, as it is with one sitting in the Arctic, and the other in the Antarctic.
Having sad that, this cryptocurrency is completely independent of any form of central authority
and so cross-border transactions are easily accomplished. It takes less than an hour and, in most
cases, just 10 minutes to effectively transfer payment from one person to the next. The biggest
problem that this kind of system will face, if you think about it, is that there is no enforce of
trust. That was the whole point of the trust institutions being erected at the start of civilization. A
central authority was needed to make sure that everyone was kept honest and that money would
change hands as promised, but the cryptocurrency does away with all that and makes the system
trust-neutral. That means we do not need a centralized system to act as the trust institution. We
don’t need to have anyone print or manage the supply of currency and we do not need any
unnecessary printing of currency and waste of paper. Instead, the trust system is kept in what we
call a blockchain – which is the topic of this book. We will get to that in more detail shortly, but,
for now, we are just getting underway to understand the fundamental overview of
cryptocurrencies.
To get a good grasp of the cryptos, we need to think about the role of money. We use bills –
paper notes and metal coins, which we call fiat currency, to market the value of the exchange. If
you buy a stick of gum at the newsstand, you exchange that stick of gum with a certain value
when you hand the cashier a dollar bill. That dollar bill symbolizes the trust institution’s
guarantee that you will be able to use that same value when you take that dollar bill and give it to
someone else for another purchase you make. This means that the dollar bill moves from The
Mint when it was first printed, and goes to the bank and to the customer and, from there, it passes
hands constantly until its service life is over and it gets sent back to the treasury and is
incinerated. When it is incinerated, another bill takes its place. Nothing new is created and
nothing old is destroyed; it merely carries the value of one person’s labor and contribution.
If you think deeply about it, the ubiquitous paper currency is convenient to use in person, but
fails when we can’t shred it up and transmit it across broadband to pay for an online purchase. It
is more important that we start leaning towards the use of a currency that lends itself to electronic
transmission.
There are two things that you need to consider when you come into electronic transmission. The
first is that it gives you an opportunity to re-engineer the outdated and expensive trust
institutions, and the second is using the centralized systems creates a little bit of a problem as it
places too much value in a centralized location. Think about the hacking and theft of online
assets. When you put all your assets in one location, any breach will compromise all that. The
centralized model, even in data storage, is not that preferred these days.
As an example of the online world and looking to decentralized systems, look at the world of
cloud storage. It is increasingly trending towards the use of decentralized and fragmented storage
solutions that provide safety and reliability, while protecting against targeted cyber-attacks (i.e.
hacking and DDOS attacks) or physical attacks – like property destruction.
In fragmented distributed storage, a single file is broken into smaller pieces, and each piece is
then encrypted and sent to multiple locations. There are also duplicates kept at other locations as
well. When the user wants to retrieve it, his app pulls all the files from the locations and brings
them back and decrypts them. This way, when a server is attacked, the data stays safe.
That is not an example of a blockchain, but the distributed files storage systems use of
blockchains to keep track of the data. The example was more to illustrate the value of
decentralized systems over centralized ones.
In cryptocurrencies, there is no physical manifestation of value (like the dollar bill); instead, the
value is taken from each person’s word or promise. It is a messaging system that keeps track of
this intent to pay and then transacts that payment. It is called a distributed ledger because it is
like a massive ledger with millions of people all paying each other by their word alone, and
without a single piece of paper.
That ledger is part of the blockchain and it keeps a record of every transaction in the system, and
everyone has total access to that ledger to understand the records if those payments are valid, to
confirm ownership of assets, and to facilitate the transfer of value.
The blockchain is the engine that drives all this. On top of the blockchain, everything is just a
messaging system. Within the blockchain, the algorithm is sophisticated and, more importantly,
the strength of the system is not predicated on the power of the coding, but on the structure of the
system. That makes it virtually unhackable from a system’s perspective. There are certain
security issues but, so far, the system itself has been robust. As we go through the rest of this
book, we will discover the genius of the messaging system and the blockchain that supports it
underneath. To do this, we will look at the cryptography involved, the common vernacular and
definitions of cryptocurrencies and blockchains, the blocks that make up the blockchain, and the
proof of work in the mining process.
The bulk of this gives us the full handle we need to form a solid foundation in cryptocurrencies.
Remember, the currency is only as robust as the blockchain under it, and the same goes to your
understanding of it.
Chapter 1: Fundamentals Of Cryptocurrencies
To understand the ecosystem, and before we reintroduce the concept of messaging intent to
transfer value, we will look at the ecosystem of a blockchain and the basis of a coin or token in
the world of cryptocurrencies. The definition may seem alien, but it is fairly easy once you get
through the basics. The terms are not listed in alphabetical order, but in the order that will best
serve you in layering on the understanding of the subject matter.
Nodes
Nodes are a good place to start. They are the points in a network and are typically considered the
computer or terminal in each netw0rk, but they are actually, and more specifically, the instance
of the Application that is running the Bitcoin protocol – which is called Bitcoind. Each node has
a particular address and starts off by getting online, then downloading and installing Bitcoind, if
you want to be part of the Bitcoin network. Other cryptos have other blockchain versions and
instances and have different apps that create this on your computer.
There are approximately 12,000 nodes in the Bitcoin system, and this can be visualized on a
map. You can find that here: https://bitnodes.earn.com/. The nodes form the network that is
decentralized and each node can talk to another node if it wants to and, over the life of the
network, every node would have talked to every other node. This is essentially a P2P network
that we will describe next.
There are two kinds of nodes. The first is a lite node and that node just keeps track of the
transaction that node has taken part in, and the other is the regular node that keeps track of all the
transactions in the entire ecosystem.
P2P
P2P stands for Peer-to-Peer and it is a network that people, through their computers and devices,
can become a part of it. P2P initially was popular for its file-sharing features during the days of
Napster. The content was deemed an infringement of copyright, but the technology and the
concept was quite sound. It just didn’t go anywhere until the advent of cryptocurrencies.
There is no need to do any major programming as the app will usually do everything that is
necessary. You just have to load it up, install it, and the app will open up a port – typically port
8332. From there, it connects to other nodes in the network and communicates pre-determined
information. It doesn’t allow anything in the rest of your computer to be seen or shared. The P2P
format is just for a way for individual computers to come together and become a network without
any centralized server. In the typical internet infrastructure, there is a client-server relationship.
All the data sits in the server, and the client engage the server and ask for the information. The
information is centralized and, if in the event of a hack, a DDOS (Distributed Denial of Service)
attack that disables the server, or even physical acts of terrorism on the server farm, all will be
lost. In the distributed system, an attack cannot disable the entire system because each node is
not dependent on the other node. If one node goes down, there are still numerous nodes left to fill
the gap in any way. In the Bitcoin ecosystem, the nodes broadcast information to each other. It is
the way to spread information across the network. If one node gets hacked or DDOS’d, the other
nodes can still provide reliable copies of the information. The advantages of a P2P network
versus a centralized server architecture can be appreciated, especially in blockchains. When you
add blockchains to a P2P network, you get a system that is robust and impenetrable, yet easily
deployable across a global landscape.
Ledger
A ledger only seems to invoke the notion of a great big book that stores all the information of
each person’s account, its current balance and the transactions relevant to that account. If that is
your notion then, you are almost 100% correct. The ledger is an electronic record of all
transaction, from the transaction of the very first coin, to the very last transaction. Every single
one of those transactions can be traced back to the very beginning, and those transactions can be
mapped.
So, in essence, this ledger is a live document and the updates are transmitted across the node that
keeps a copy of their ledger on the computer that hosts the app. That ledger has grown to a fairly
large file at this point. Each time a person starts up a new node, they typically have to download
the entire ledger from the first transaction all the way to the most recent, and then keep its ears
open to update the ledger as and when a transaction is complete.
The value of this distributed ledger is priceless and inexpensive. Each person who is a member
of the network, and who uses the network, bears the cost of his own computer and it is incidental
to his own use of the computer, so the cost of the distributed system becomes fragmented and
inconsequential. This is the first benefit of such a system. As opposed to the public cost of
maintaining a centralized infrastructure to print, regulate, enforce and defend the currency,
cryptos are relatively uncomplicated and market-driven.
The node’s responsibility goes more than just maintaining the ledger, it is also tasked with
reviewing the transaction that is transmitted to it, and to figure out if an address has the funds it
needs to spend it, or not spend it twice.
Gossip Protocol
The nodes in the network communicate on an algorithm with the Bitcoind called the gossip
protocol. When a block is completed, that block needs to be transmitted to the ledgers contained
in each node, and that block has a certain identification number. One node will ask another node
if it has that block, and if that node doesn’t, then it will transfer that block for this new node to
save. That node will then randomly select another block and find out if that node has the new
information. It also does another thing. Once it has told the node its information, it asks that node
if it has other new information and compares it to what it already has. If the information from the
other node is not within its ledger, then it will take that information as well. That way there is a
two-way exchange of information.
Each node contacts six other nodes (in most cases that is true, but you can adjust your Bitcoind
app to contact more nodes if you like). In most cases, nodes just contact six others at random.
The node they choose is randomly selected and so, each time it opens a communication to a
node, it is a different set of nodes. This keeps the system safe by not allowing predictability of
who the node contacts are.
If each contact six, then theoretically, it will only take six hops from any new piece of
information originating from a node to reach all existing nodes. Think about it like this – the first
node passes it to six nodes and each of them pass it to six more. That makes 36 nodes that are
now up-to-date on that information which was broadcast by the first node. Those 36 then
broadcast to six more which makes it 216. That’s three jumps so far. From there, it becomes
1,296, and then 7,776 on the fifth hop. On the sixth hop, it becomes 46,656, but there are only
12,000 nodes at this point which means that it only takes a little over five hops to disseminate all
the information of every transaction to the entire ecosystem. That happens in just a few seconds
and everyone is up-to-date. The gossip protocol is extremely effective and can be used in larger
ecosystems effectively.
Consensus Methods
This consensus algorithm is a feature contained with the blockchain’s algorithm. It is a core
function in that it keeps the system in check and avoids the forking of the blockchain. It can be
said that the consensus algorithm is related to the gossip protocol because it tells the next node
what it knows, and also checks to see if that node has anything to add. It tries to build a
consensus of what is right and what is not. An occasion that requires the execution of the
consensus protocol hardly happens, but if it does, the protocol staves of a forking in the chain.
The consensus algorithm takes information from the node population, attaching it to the previous
block that it has in its version of memory. In the event that someone tries to make their own
block (or alter a block to include an unsanctioned transaction), the few nodes around the
offending node may accept the block for a few moments. The moment they receive word of the
other block that has really been accepted by the general network population, and that information
gets to them, they will now realize that there are two blocks in the system vying for the same
space in the chain.
Because two blocks can’t occupy the same spot in the chain, the nodes that receive conflicting
information will await the next confirmation. They will then look at the block that was used, and
they will also use that block. Eventually, the block that has the longest chain survives.
For any block to be confirmed, it has to have the consensus of 50% + 1 of the nodes in the
network. The only way the node in the network will accept the newly minted block is if it is part
of the longest chain. That is the only way the nodes (or rather the algorithm in the nodes) will
reach a consensus. If there is a discrepancy as we mentioned earlier, then the nodes will wait
until the next block is attached and then the next block, and then the next one, until it starts to see
the pattern of blocks that are slowly increasing. It will then erase from its memory the offending
block. The entire network will reflect the appropriate transactions in the block at that point.
This is why you should wait for at least three confirmations to ship your product. It is not until
there are a few confirmations built on top of the block that contains your transaction that you can
be confident that the payment is legitimate.
Messages
A transaction is when Mr. A sends Mr. B a message saying that he is sending him 1BTC.
Remember that’s all it takes because it is a message. Once the message is sent, the system
materializes the intention of the sender. The first thing the node does is check if the sender has
the right to spend that 1BTC. Basically, it checks to see if the balance is sufficient to cover the
intended amount to be sent over. If the amount is sufficient, then the node conducts 16 points of
verification that is found in the logarithm and, if that all checks out, then the node broadcasts that
transaction.
These are the list of checks that it conducts:
Each transaction, which is a message, must be less than the maximum block size of 1
MB.
Transaction sizes must be greater than, or equal to 100 bytes.
The value of each transaction must not be less than 0 and not more than 21 million BTC.
There can be no hash inputs that are equal to 0.
The complete data structure is correct.
The locking script must match the standard format.
The lock time must be less than the maximum allowed number.
The number of signatures must be less than the signature limit.
Unlocking script can only push numbers onto the stack.
With each input, the output must exist and not have been spent.
All input and outputs must have values.
The full transaction’s syntax must be correct.
But that transaction doesn’t go to the rest of the nodes. It is then placed in a queue and sent to
what are called miners. Miners need to take this transaction after the node verifies it and place it
in what is called a block. We will look at what a block is a little farther down. In most cases,
once the transaction is done, it is considered complete, but it is always best to wait for
confirmation that the payment is complete. Confirmation is done by the mining process. Mining
is done by miners and is described in the chapter on Mining.
Account Balance
The account balance that you see in the software does not have some kind of recording of the
amount you send and receive, meaning it doesn’t record your activities while you send and
receive. Instead, it looks at the blockchain to get the data it needs. The wallet scours the
blockchain for every transaction that that address was a part of. If there were no transactions,
then the account balance would show zero. The point of this is that you can log on to any
Bitcoind node and enter the address you are looking for and it will always show you the current
balance in that account. You don’t even need a Bitcoind app for that; in fact, you can even go to
the Bitcoin website and look up an address and you would see the available balance and the
transaction history of that account. When you open up your wallet, you would have to enter the
address you are interested in messaging from, or accepting funds and look at the balance. If you
want to move that balance, then you would have to provide the private key and move it from
there.
Genesis Block and New Coins
Most of you would have heard of this thing called the Genesis Block. As you can imagine, it is
the block that first started out and it was the block that transactions from the coins that the
developer awarded himself. Since there was nothing to mine at the time and the coins had to
come first, the initial transactions were done by the developer, and when he mined those blocks,
he got more coins. It started from there and, eventually, as more people caught on, more miners
were needed to put the transactions in blocks. You will see how this works in the Mining
chapter.
New coins are added to the network every ten minutes, or thereabouts. The exact time is not
fixed, but it is fairly accurate. The reason is that the coins are not released randomly. The miners
have to solve a puzzle in order to get the reward – that reward is in the form of new coins. The
miner then sells those coins and gets whatever he agrees for in return. In most cases, the miners
go to the exchange markets and exchange them for fiats because their mining equipment and
computational power and energy usages are paid in hard currency. That does two things. First, it
allows new participants to come in because there is always a seller among the miners, and new
entrants have a way to get new coins. The second is that it increases the supply of coins in a
predictable way. That keeps the inflation of BTC at a predictable and falling rate over time. The
maximum number of coins that will ever be released is 21,000,000 and that amount will be
reached in the next few years.
There are no other ways of creating new coins and, once the system reaches its limit, those are all
the coins that can be in the market.
To avoid a supply problem, you have to realize that the coins are not limited by their
denomination. Each Bitcoin can be divided into 100,000,000 (one hundred million) parts. Each
part is called a Satoshi. In the event that the limit is reached and the coins are so successful and
prevalent that a million more users come on board, then the market price will adjust in a certain
way that it would be common place to transact in Satoshis than it would be to transact in
Bitcoins.
It is a reverse inflation question that is resolved by the management of the denomination. For
instance, you now pay about 10,000 USD for 1 BTC. For some people, that’s more than they
need and they just want to buy a little at a time to pay for the ISP service – for instance. That ISP
is charging $10, payable in BTC, which would be 0.001 BTC. If I purchased 1 BTC for this, it
would last me 1,000 months. So, what’s the point? Instead, I can buy 100,000 Satoshis or 0.001
BTC for $10 and use that to pay my ISP, but that example is not to tell you to pay your ISP with
BTC; no, it is about showing you that you can break a BTC into its smallest component. When
you do that when the supply of BTC stops, the fiat value of something can be expressed in
Satoshis rather than in BTC, so, instead of having only twenty one million units of BTC to work
with, you can have 2.1 trillion Satoshis. That would be enough to supply the world for some time
to come.
Chapter 2: Cryptography
There is a significant amount of mathematics that goes into the entire Bitcoin ecosystem - from
hashing, to cryptography, and even probability, and that is then merged with the powers of
computing. The outcomes are a structurally-secure platform that can handle the demands of a
robust online currency and still be run semi-autonomously without the need for central
authorities, and yet be trust-neutral.
To understand the power of the blockchain better, it is best that we dive in headfirst into the
cryptography that drives the whole thing. After all, that is what it is called crypto – for
cryptography.
Hashes, Hashing and SHA 256
To understand the cryptography, the first thing we need to look at is the SHA 256. This is a 256
bit Secure Hashing Algorithm. Without getting too much in the way the algorithm works, you
can easily go to an online hashing website and enter whatever you want and get the hash for it.
Try it.
Go to https://passwordsgenerator.net/sha256-hash-generator/
Place this sentence in the box: The Cow Jumped Over The Moon
In return, you will get this:
3474A5E82F8FED7D5C9FBDC181ED562815C7C95F2D0C6B2D10C502ECB2A39043
Now, place the same sentence, but just alter the first alphabet and change it to lower case, like
this:
the Cow Jumped Over The Moon
Note that only the first alphabet has changed, and even then by only altering the case and, when
the sentence is put into the box and hashed, this is the outcome:
E7EEA2B7CE4F32A53337A15D85F5F2B5A6A8E65CEE6283117C8432C58FF68E70
For such a small difference in the change of the original sentence, the change in the output is
starkly different. This is one of the reasons you cannot reverse engineer the original phrase;
hence, it makes it a secure hashing algorithm.
If you haven’t guessed it, hashing just means to change any sentence and put it into the
seemingly random character string. Here is another example. If you take the entire Introduction
chapter from this book, which is over a thousand words, it gives us this:
821EA5FEFA1E48DE85E30E13378A616CECD188D2CD609A2B315472ED4C474DFA
It still gives us a similarly-looking string of characters, but you will never be able to reverse
engineer this string to return to the content of the Introduction by just the hash. This makes it
extremely secure.
Private Keys
The key to the entire thing as far as a user is concerned is the secrecy of his private key. Users
have private keys that can authorize payments when one sends a message from an address. The
private key is the core of everything. If you lose your private key to the address, then you should
transfer your money out and get a new address. The secrecy of the key is of paramount
importance.
Private keys are generated first. It is a random number that is chosen from a robust random
number generator between 1 and 2
97. It is impossible to guess any number, or to end up using it
more than once. To be able to guess that number will take more energy than there is in our sun,
so the number is fairly secure.
Once a random number generator gets this number, it can then be converted to a public key and
that public key is then converted to an address. Now that you know that the hash only works one
way, you will also know that the Bitcoin address that is given to anyone to send the message to
the money cannot be reverse engineered. This is the way the private keys are kept secure and this
is the way that the entire Bitcoin infrastructure is managed.
Just for fun, if you take a simple number, your birthday perhaps, and take a hash of that, so let’s
say your date of birth is 1.1.1911, so you put in 01011911 in the hash generator, this is what you
get:
FA372F9E71529403A63AFFB4E5C04E466E63D567CB054F1CBFCFD5B7FCD36E50
Now, imagine that is the string you want to use as your private key. To convert that to your
public key, it requires another mathematical operation. We will look at this in the next section.
Public Keys
With the private key in hand, you can now generate the corresponding public key. To generate
the public key, there is an asymmetric mathematical function that takes one number (the private
key ) and plots it on an elliptic curve then generates the public key from the resulting line that
intersects the curve. So, in essence, the public key is derived from the private key, but you
cannot reverse engineer the private key from the public key. You must always keep the private
key confidential and, if possible, try not to keep it on your computer in case it is hacked or has
catastrophic failure. If you can, place it in a cold wallet – something that does not connect to the
Internet. Use it only when you need to spend the money in a particular address.
Bitcoin Address
Your Bitcoin address is where someone who is paying you sends you the transaction message,
but, remember, this is not a bank account, but more like an email address. They are merely
sending you a message. Inside that message, you can write anything you want in addition to the
message that specifically includes an amount of the funds to be transferred. Remember the other
nodes will check this. If there is insufficient value to transfer, then the message will not be
included in the block or unsuccessful.
This Bitcoin address is mathematically linked to both the public key and the private key, by
extension. It is merely the SHA256 hash of the public key.
So, now what you have are three numbers that constitute the core of the Bitcoin network as it
pertains to you, the sender, or to you as the receiver.
You use the Bitcoin address to send and receive funds, you then use the public key to show that
you have the right to send the message from the address and you use the private key as the
password to prove to the system that you indeed have the authority to manage the account and
dispatch the message.
To put it simply, when you put in your private key, the app automatically looks to see if it
corresponds to the public key. If it does, then your message will be authentic and that would
result in the message being permitted to pass through the network.
The five things that you need to prepare you for the upcoming blockchain overview is the
hashing algorithm used in all things related to Bitcoin – the SHA256; you then need to
understand how private keys are generated and what you need to do to keep yourself secure so
that no one can guess them and no one can brute force them. You then need to understand the
role of public keys and how Bitcoin addresses are generated. You have all that. With that, you
can now go on to the next layer of the issue which are blocks and transactions.
Chapter 3: Blocks and Transactions
Before we get into miners and mining, we need to make a quick stop at trying to understand
blocks and transactions. It is important to know and understand that Bitcoin transactions are not
typical remittances that we think of, but rather they are messages of an indication to give
someone (the recipient) the value (in Bitcoin) that you (the sender) already possess. I repeat this
often in this book because there is a large body of misunderstood and ill-described material out
in the ether. Many people still think that cryptocurrency is a physical coin because they see these
images online that show a conventional coin embossed with the Bitcoin logo and the circuit
board etching and think it is some form of an electric coin. None of this is true and you have to
really understand the concept of the message and the transactions that is driven by it.
It is the ultimate contract where man’s word is literally his value – when the message is sent – it
is as good as gold. That’s the point of Bitcoin.
Ok, so we already know that transactions are messages that go from sender to receiver and that
message transfers a certain amount that the sender has to the receiver’s address. But where does
that value come from? How does it get injected into the electronic network and the Bitcoin
network in particular?
Your currency should be convenient for your habits of exchange. If you go to the marketplace in
the town’s square, then carrying wads of cash fifty years ago was appropriate. Today, the town
square has become the global square and the marketplace has become accessible via the Internet
but the value carriers only lend themselves to physical exchanges.
But where does the sender get it from? Well, the sender has only three ways of having a coin in
his address. He either mined it, bought it, or someone paid him for a product or service. He
cannot just create it out of thin air – and that is an important point to make for two reasons. First,
for those of you who are thinking that you could just make a string of numbers up, you can’t, and
I will explain why in a moment. Second, you can’t just spend it twice either – well, that is
another way of making your own coin, and you can’t do that either. The system is very adept at
preventing that from happening and it’s not just the code that is in the system but the fact that it
is a distributed system. I am a pentester, and I have tried, as an exercise, to penetrate the Bitcoin
nodes in my basement from a remote computer. I can’t ever seem to break the system, and that is
a good thing for many reasons. It means that the only weak link in the whole chain is the person
holding the private key. In that way, it is like pasting your ATM pin number on your card so you
won’t forget it. If you can keep your private key safe, you are not going to lose your coins.
This brings us back to creating coins out of thin air – you can’t. The whole purpose of the blocks
in the blockchain, and the mining that is required, is threefold:
1. To allow miners to expend something of value in the real world so that something of
value can be created in the electronic world.
2. To give each coin or token legitimacy by giving it the credibility of past use. The more it
is used, the more subsequent users know that that coin has the ability to be a legitimate
carrier of value – that chain of blocks replaces the centralized need for a trust institution
to legitimize the carrier of value the way governments do for paper currency.
3. Finally, it precludes forgery so that not one, but every participant is able to validate and
store the credibility and legitimacy of the coin. This obviates the need, again, for a
centralized system.
To get a more internalized understanding of this, it would serve you well to look at the
philosophical and historical evolution of the mechanisms of exchange. We can’t go through the
full details and full history of the evolution of money, but we will do the best we can to give the
current issue context.
Philosophy of Equity and Exchange
This is the crux of the whole Bitcoin value transfer system and this is where you need to
disengage your mind from what you and I are so used to. We are used to the printed piece of
paper with Jackson, Franklin and Washington printed on them to be something of value on its
own. We forget that fiat currency only represents a value. It is in paper form because it’s a lot
easier to fold and put in your money clip or wallet. That makes it easy to carry around. Imagine
having to carry around a cart full of gold to make your transactions. That dollar bill merely
carries the value of something that you did in the past to get it that value. You may have labored
at the office, or profited at your business, and your contribution of value resulted in the
conversion of that dollar. That dollar on its own is a piece of paper. It has value because you
worked for it and the sovereign government of the land you live in has printed these (supposedly)
unforgeable mediums of exchange as a public good.
That fiat currency – the dollar bill, or gold coin, is just a vessel of value. The actual value itself is
not that thing that carries it. You went to work, got paid, took that money and bought bread.
Money served as the medium of value that could easily move between getting paid by your
employer, to being used as the medium to purchase products so that it made transactions more
convenient. Otherwise, you would have to go to the baker and barter him with your skill to get a
loaf of bread – what a headache.
So, what we have established painstakingly is that value is different from its carrier. Now that we
know that, then we can willingly make the carrier more relevant to the venue and method of
interaction. We used physical paper when we traded physically. Now we trade electronically, so
something electronic is appropriate. We already mentioned this part and you get that, but here is
the point of all this. You see, printed fiats have one thing going for them and that is that the
government that printed them places their weight behind the piece of paper and says that they
stand behind it – and that gives the people the assurances that they need that the paper can hold
the value that the people put in it.
Make no mistake, the value of the currency does not come from the institutions of trust that the
government represents, the value comes from the labor and contribution that people put in to it;
whereas, once the government provided security for it, they also ended up giving it value
because the fiat was backed by the total output of the country and managed by the supply of the
printed bill. In cryptocurrencies, none of that exists and so the only way you can give the
currency value and give it credibility and give people the confidence to use it is if it has a track
record. By that, I don’t just mean that Bitcoin in general and as a whole needs to get credibility, I
mean the value and utility of each Satoshi and Bitcoin needs to have the credibility. In fact, to
make it plausible and serve as a carrier, that carrier must have a credible starting point and usage
over time to develop a history of its use. Without that history, and without that credible starting
point, that coin has no value since it does not have the backing of a sovereign body.
I know it’s been a pretty philosophical and long trip to get from the start of this discussion to this
point – but it is necessary to describe the weight of the blockchain. You would be remiss to
undervalue the prominence of the blockchain in the future of human interaction, and it would be
easy to dismiss it if you did not understand the philosophical aspect of the blockchain.
Because human exchange is about the exchange of value, and value can only be created by
expenditure of effort, it would be impossible to transition from the physical world to the
electronic one without the correct procedure and without effort.
Transactions
As I mentioned, each transaction transfers a certain amount of coin from a person who has it, to a
person who is about to receive it. A person without a coin in their account can’t send any, but a
person with a fresh, brand new address can receive any amount. There are no limitations to
creating as many addresses as possible. Remember, the number of addresses you can open is
equivalent to the number of private keys you can generate. There are 2
97 possible private keys
that you can generate and while that may look small, here is what that actually looks like:
1.5845633 x 10
29 - to make that more evident – that’s:
158,456,330,000,000,000,000,000,000,000.
To put that into perspective, earth has 7.5 x 10
15 grains of sand. That means if each grain of sand
was an earth-like planet that had the same number of grains of sand contained within it, then the
number of private keys you could generate would all the grains of sand combined. Get it… ok,
it’s a lot. Trust me on that one.
The reason we take the trouble to make it a point to stress this is that the chance of a collision is
remote, in statistical terms, and this just means that if you keep the pick of your private key
perfectly random, the chances of you finding a private key that hasn’t been taken yet is very
close to zero.
Those odds dramatically change if you pick a number that you like – your birthday for instance,
or your anniversary and then try to convert that to a hash and then use that to create the public
key and a Bitcoin address; what you will find is that it’s probably already taken. The collision
rate goes up significantly the moment you do not let the private key be randomly picked by a
truly random number generator. You can find one here: https://www.random.org/strings/
Once you pick a random number, you can write that number down somewhere and then, my
suggestion is that you run it through a SHA256 convertor like we did earlier and that will give
you the hash of that number. You can then take that as your private key and generate the public
key from there and then get a Bitcoin address from there.
All that is comparatively a lot of work, because if you have a Bitcoind on your computer, it is
going to generate an account, and a public and private key for you as many times as you want.
By the way, you can download that here: https://bitcoin.org/en/download. It will be as easy as pie
and you should just stick to doing it that way. I have mentioned the process so you understand
how it’s done and that will give you an understanding of how the blockchain works as well under
it.
Now that we took that minor detour, let’s get back to our topic of transactions. When you
conduct a transaction, it is a message telling the world that you, Mr. A, are sending Mr. B, X
BTC. Remember, you are not just telling Mr. B, so be careful of the text message that you
include in the message. Once you send that message to the world, all nodes are listening.
Remember the gossip protocol as it starts to work at this point and the message gets into the
queue and the nodes go into action to verify that your message can be a message. Assuming all
goes well, the transaction is righteous and it gets confirmed and the recipient is now the legal
owner of the coin.
The coin takes on life because of transactions, and the transactions have value because of the
coin. There are two aspects of value when it comes to a coin. The first is that no coin comes free
– putting aside the initial coins that were released to the developer to get the ball rolling, but,
even then, one could convincingly argue that the coins were reward for the sweat equity that was
put into the development of the protocol and the algorithm that was built on top of it.
From the very first transaction until today, every coin starts its life with a certain intrinsic value.
That value is defined as the value that miners put in to do the computation necessary to create the
block. Why we need the block, and how that is important, we will talk about in this chapter, but
in the next section.
The second part of the value that can be assigned to the coin is the value of net demand. If net
demand is positive, then the intrinsic value that the coins have will gain a premium. If the net
demand is negative, then the coins will erode from their intrinsic value and eventually grind to a
halt and be worth nothing.
As with anything in commerce, the value of one thing can exist in a vacuum, but to know and
transmit that value, it has to be expressed in terms of another commodity or item of value. In the
case of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency, there is a vibrant exchange market that gives you an
accurate determination of value in almost any other fiat currency of value. In US dollar terms,
the value of BTC (Bitcoin)has risen from mere pennies per BTC to $5, then on to $50 and on to
$500, and all the way up to almost $20,000. Yes, that was twenty-thousand dollars. It wasn’t a
typo.
Old school economists can’t fathom why something that has no tangible link – like how the
dollar is linked to the sovereign wealth of a country, can end up being worth so much. The
reason is not because it is a secret currency or that it has some nefarious advantage; what they
don’t get is that it is the appropriate innovation for the colliding of two socio-economic
phenomena – online commerce, and distrust of centralized authority.
The value of the Bitcoin has been defined by the Fiat currency put in the physical world. Some
people think that that makes BTC untenable as a major currency in the future, but that doesn’t
matter, because Bitcoin in itself is not designed to displace sovereign currency.
The things to remember about transactions are this:
1. Transactions are messages that are broadcast to the entire network and are carried across
the nodes by the gossip protocol.
2. All transactions are irreversible, so don’t make a mistake.
3. Each transaction is automatically given an irrevocable transaction ID, regardless of size.
A transaction ID looks like this (example):
447aebdb9e8c42dd3b617e5e5785634205a96af9d1500ae5b7af03127e186e0a. If you click on it, it will take
you to the blockchain.org and give you the information of that transaction.
4. Each TXID (transaction ID) will list out the address that sent the payment and the address
that received it. Details about TXIDs are presented next.
Transaction ID
That transaction ID is then placed in a pool - assuming that the nodes have considered the
transaction to be legit. Once the transaction is in a pool, all the transaction IDs plus the header
information (typical things like date and time stamp, block number and something called a
nonce) is placed in the block and hashed.
Hashes and hashing were described and discussed in Chapter 2. Once they are hashed, the block
returns a unique string of alphanumeric characters. You saw within that section that even the
smallest change, like altering one character in the entire text by changing it from a lower case to
an upper case, renders the hash absolutely and unmistakably different and thus changes to it can’t
be made if you do not want to disrupt all that is built around it. Even if a person were to hack a
system and sneak in a transaction retroactively, the hash wouldn’t match and the nonce wouldn’t
work and the block will fail but, if somehow a malicious actor was determined enough to mine
the block and get the proper nonce for the block, the problem is the hash for the original block
was placed in the subsequent block and hashed out. Remember that each block includes the hash
of the last block among other things so if you want to alter a transaction six blocks deep, then
when you go to hash that block, the hash that is supposed to appear in the next block will change,
and that alters the next block. If you want to go ahead and alter that block as well, you would
have to put in a huge amount of hashing power just to get one transaction changed. After two to
three blocks, the benefit becomes unworthy of the effort.
But mining is not so simple because within the transaction IDs, time and date stamp and previous
block number, there is that thing we call nonce. Remember that? Well, the nonce is a really a
random number, and that random number is used to control the resulting hash.
Why does the system need to control the outcome of that hash? They do that so that there are
opportunities for the miners to do the puzzle that process the hashes until it gets the format it is
looking for. The first miner to get the hash gets the reward. Once the block is hashed, it is placed
in sequence and the next block is processed and it will include the block hash of the previous
block.
Do you see the genius of the system?
Blocks
Ok, so this is where it gets interesting. If you have been looking deeply at transactions, you must
be considering how on earth you pass on the value of something without it being subjected to
forgery and manipulation. Well, that’s what blocks are for.
Each transaction is about 100 kb in size and can vary upwards from there, as long as it is not
over the 1 MB limit. As multiple transactions are accumulated, the nodes shuttle them into a
queue so that a miner can take them and lock them up in blocks.
This is where it gets confusing for most people, so pay attention.
A group of transactions is called a block, but it does not stop there. These transactions are
accumulated and if you look at this block, for instance, block number 520763, you can see in
blockchain.info when you search for blocks by number, it will tell you all the transactions that
are listed by TXID.
When a block is constructed, it is done so by the miners and that will be discussed a little more in
that chapter. When the miners put it together, they typically take them as they are, but it is not
uncommon for miners to choose which transactions they want to include and which they do not.
There is an incentive for them by choosing the ones that have the highest fees. You see Bitcoin
has a standard fee, but senders are more than welcome to increase the amount they are paying to
expedite the confirmation times. So depending on this amount, the miners would prioritize the
transactions and load them up into a block, and then they get started with the puzzle-solving
which is to mine the block. You will see that part in the mining chapter.
Once these blocks are mined, they will be given a block number and they will be layered
sequentially. Each block has its own unique composition and unique transaction ID sets. They
will never be duplicated and no transaction is part of more than one block. Each block is then
stitched mathematically to the block that preceded it and the subsequent block will be stitched
mathematically to this present block.
We will show you all of this in the mining chapter.
But the point to make here is that because the TXIDs are unique for every transaction, the
number just can’t be used again, and the fact that the number will never be repeated makes it
impossible for anyone to alter the transaction by using the same transaction ID. If you add to
that, that once the TXID is placed in a block, and the block is tied to the previous block, then it is
impossible to undo anything that happened in the last block because that would alter all the
subsequent blocks after that.
Blocks give individual transactions the credibility of existence and confidence of usability. It
obviously works because the market price has been consistently above $5000 per Bitcoin – more
than the price of gold. Check out the historic price of Bitcoin here:
https://charts.bitcoin.com/chart/price#cat-market
We call it a coin to make it easier to explain, but you have seen there really isn’t a coin
physically present and here is how I can illustrate that to you. You know that 1 BTC can be
divided up into 100,000,000 Satoshis. That means if I sell my car to a friend and he pays me 1
BTC for it, I now have 1 BTC in my account. I can then send out 1,000 Satoshis to someone for
mowing my lawn, or 1,000,000 Satoshis to my ISP and still have a balance of 98,999,000. If it
was physical, how did I just break it up? Ok, so it’s not physical.
Now that we understand the nature of blocks, we will see what is in it, how it is formed and how
it is stitched together in the next chapter.
In wrapping up this chapter, we have just begun to understand a major component of the
blockchain and thereby understand the mechanism under the hood of cryptocurrencies like
Bitcoin.
Chapter 4: Miners and Mining
Miners do the mining, so if you know what mining is then you know what miners do. So what is
mining? No, it is not taking a pickaxe and chipping away at a cave wall to expose the precious
metal in the stone.
Mining is a computational and mathematical process that places these blocks we’ve talked about
in previous chapters in a sequence that cannot be retroactively altered. Once the transaction is in
the block, a confirmation is said to be complete. That takes about ten minutes. If you really want
the transaction to be solid, in the event it is a large transaction, then wait for six confirmations
and you can be dead certain that the transaction is confirmed and without any possibility that the
sender will reverse the transaction.
How does this work?
While regular nodes are in charge of going through a checklist and making sure every transaction
that is broadcast to them from a neighbor passes all the time on the checklist, the miner is
responsible for something just as important. The miner has to legitimize the blocks and tie them
together to the preceding block.
This takes a large investment and a tremendous effort and is not as simple as one may think
based on the description earlier in this book. In the rest of this chapter, we will go through the
other processes and show you how difficult, expressive and how it requires a high level of skill
to execute.
To act as a barrier, the Bitcoin system requires that only able parties are invoked in the mining
operations of putting together blocks. What is even more brilliant about this system is that the
difficulty and complexity scaled up with interest. When Bitcoins first entered the market, almost
anyone who wanted to be a miner could – they just needed a regular old PC to do it and they
could start mining but, as more and more people got clued on to Bitcoin and wanted to mine, the
processing requirements evolved.
It now takes expensive equipment, and lots of it, to be able to make a return on your effort. There
are not mining farms as large as factories and this has precluded the individual from using spare
resources on his laptop to participate.
Just keep this at the back of your mind as we start explaining the proof of work and why it’s
needed and then we will expand from there to the complexity of the mining process and how that
is determined.
Proof of Work
To put it simply (and we will explain this here in greater detail) your Proof of Work (POW) is
the way the system knows that effort has gone into creating the block. This is how it knows that
the lock was not just thrown together and that resources of value had to be expended in terms of
time, energy and assets that had to be deployed to do the work that comes up with the solution.
The proof of doing the work is contained in the solution to the puzzle. You can guess at it, or you
can approach it from a particular direction; you can come at it in any way you want, but the point
is that you have to work at it and keep trying until you get it. When you do, and if you are the
first one to solve the puzzle, then you get to submit that block as the next in the chain and get
your reward for that.
The miner first chooses the transaction he wants to place in the block, and then starts to conduct
a hashing operation on it. The transaction IDs are placed in a Merkle Root and the rest of the
information is added. This, as you saw, includes the time, date, previous block’s hash and the
nonce.
This is where the puzzle comes in.
Puzzle
The puzzle is to solve the nonce. Let me show you how. Imagine that the information that was to
enter the block included the following items, and let me just use random information to mimic a
real block.

If you were to hash the above information, you would get this:
EB603B946FDA9F623C2D8770B60DA775AD7B99EAC082B319116BA39664A6D04E
If you notice, the nonce is not present in the information above, and it is not in the hash result.
Now, just to prove a point, I am going to just say that the nonce is 1 and so I am going to add the
number 1 to the whole thing and run the hash program again. This is what I get:
E8B3CB25EA9D72236999330B7D2AFA878FDE9AA35D16A6EF42F52D4024972247
You see the hash has changed.
If I change the nonce to 2, this is what I get:
4A03F84264FADC60A1A9A6BD90C1B1DD3033590C7844DED0166379332559AB83
So, you get the point – changing the nonce alters the hash output. What if my constraint was that
I want the output hash to be something that starts with the number 0? What do I do then? Well,
since I cannot reverse engineer it, I am left with only one way of solving that constraint, and that
is to randomly look for numbers that would get me that nonce.
So, let’s say we use this constraint as an example – I want to have the hash start with zero. That
means I have to keep randomly guessing the nonce until I find the nonce that results in the hash
starting with zero. For this example, I had to randomly try it until I found that the nonce of
222128 resulted in the hash being:
0522BF5F28591F9F6D190EEDACFC700B869D3C35EF3DEF5023D57029589AE448
So, this hash satisfies the condition that the hash has to start with the number 0.
It was fairly simple and it took me a few minutes of repeated calculations to get the nonce I
needed, but this was a simple constraint. The typical constraint is significantly higher in
complexity and difficulty.
You can see it in two ways. First off, you can see the hash of the last block which is included in
the current block. It is:
0000000000000000003169d3297051de41502f769f2c36f6abffa7db8985ba77
If you notice the hash has 18 zeros up front. That means the algorithm assigned the miner the
puzzle and told him he needed to find the nonce that would result in a hash that began with 18
zeros.
That is not always the case. The system alters the number of zeros it wants the miner to find
based on the difficulty it deems appropriate. One zero is fairly easy to obtain, two zeros in
sequential order would be less so, and, by the time you get to 10 or 18 zeros, you would have to
hash millions of times before you can get to the answer that you are looking at. However, the
many zeros the system is going to constrain you with depends on what it deems the difficulty
should be for you to be able to find the nonce. The level of difficulty that is needed can be
ascertained at any point by looking at the difficulty chart info here:
https://blockchain.info/charts/difficulty
To better understand this difficulty measure and place it in context, we need to look at the hash
rate and get an understanding of that as well. This brings us to hash rates and mining rigs.
Hash Rate
The current hash rate can be found here: https://blockchain.info/charts/hash-rate. It indicates that
the rate has been rising steadily over time and that it currently stands at approximately 31 million
terahashes per second (TH/s). That is an extremely high number because 1 terahash already
means 10
12 or 1,000,000,000,000, or one trillion hashes. Can you imagine the computational
power that needs to go into computing 1 trillion hashes per second? Now, imagine that
multiplied by 30 million. That’s the level of hashing that is going on now in the mining world for
Bitcoin to keep the currency going.
Every second that goes by, all the miners in the world are collectively calculating
31,000,000,000,000,000,000 – thirty one million trillion hashes every second. The more miners
that come online, the more that difficulty number is going to go up. Miners enter the fray to be
the first to solve the puzzle and claim the reward which is 12.5 Bitcoins at the moment. In one
day, 12.5 Bitcoins are released every ten minutes. That means 75 Bitcoins an hour are up for
grabs. At today’s market value of almost 10,000 dollars, that’s 750,000 a day that can be gained
from mining. This is the reason you see miners flood the market because there are significant
amounts of revenue up for grabs.
But the system is built in such a way that the more hash power there is, the more difficult the
puzzle. This is because the intention of the developers of Bitcoin was to have a predictable
interval between the release of new Bitcoins into the population. Remember Bitcoin is released
only through miners as a reward for their mining contribution. To keep this consistently at ten
minutes (or close to it), the system monitors the hash rate that is online, plus the timing it took
the last few puzzles to be solved. You can see that here:
https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-confirmationtime.html
If the system sees that there are so many miners and the hash rate increases to the point that they
are finding solutions faster than 9 minutes or less, then the system changes the nonce constraint
and may say we now need there to be 19 zeros and that will add a few more minutes of
processing time.
Mining Rig
This is a good time to start talking about mining rigs and how the Bitcoin blockchain is kept
alive. While we are on the subject, you should come to realize by now that in the event that there
are no more miners, then the entire system comes to a halt because the blocks will stop being
attached to the chains.
Miners are categorized in two ways these days; one is the independent miner and the other is the
pool miner.
When mining first began, anyone could do it on their computer and the CPUs could handle the
calculations. Back then, hash rates were in the region of kilohashes per second and the CPUs
could handle that even if they did get hot and needed extra cooling. But then, as more miners got
into the mix, you guessed it, the difficulty went up and so miners competed to increasing their
hash power and so they started using their GPU cards which were significantly more powerful
than the CPUs.
The competition become increasingly fierce and so specialized rigs were developed. These rigs
could actually do little else. Companies like NVidia, manufacturers of video cards, started
targeting this market instead of their usual gaming market, and they started offering more
powerful hashing cards. Eventually, that gave way to specialized hashing machines called
ASICs. These hashing machines couldn’t do anything else except calculate millions of hashes.
When that didn’t stop the competition, people started grouping their computers and buying up
more hash power to coin, and then try to solve the puzzles that way, but that soon was
outstripped as well.
Today, what you find are either large mining farms that have anywhere from 20 ASICS running
24 hours, or factories running hundreds of ASICs, or, on the other hand, you find people just
buying the equipment and hooking on to mining pools.
Mining pools are just individual miners that get together and combine their smaller hashing
power to become a large pool and become competitive in being able to solve the nonce puzzle.
Once the mining is complete and the hash complies with the constraint, that nonce is then left in
the block and the hash is advertised. That hash is then used for the subsequent block and then
that block is mined.
By doing it in this way, value moves from the physical world where work is done, to the online
world where the coins are transacted. The miners spend considerable fixed and variable costs to
mine the blocks and then allow the blocks to be verified, confirmed and added to the earlier
block.
Chapter 5: Downside of Blockchain
There are numerous benefits to the blockchain technology and there are numerous uses to it in
the form of coin, token and currency among other things. The thing about blockchains is that
they are hard to grasp, and the maths behind them tends to make people cringe when they are
first introduced to it.
Then you add that to the fact that the programming behind the blockchain can be complex when
you get down to the nitty-gritty of it, but my advice to you is to not let it distort your perception
of the next new thing in finance.
The system’s complexity varies based on who you ask. For me, the system is as simple as it can
be. For a recent computer grad, there could be some conceptual challenges, but the guys who are
in their mid-careers are the ones that will find it a little strange as it is a completely new
paradigm. Don’t worry though, as it just takes a little getting used to.
When it comes to transaction costs, it is mostly cost-efficient but, for those of you who think that
Bitcoin is absolutely free, you need to think again. There are costs associated with it, but the
benefits far outweigh those costs – unless you are trying to make micro payments and then the
cost is not worth it if you are on the Bitcoin platform. For that, you should try one of the other
new coins.
The biggest downside is that it is facing a steep uphill battle with lawmakers in countries that are
advanced in technology and backward in thinking. Countries are used to keeping track on their
citizens for one reason or another, and their knee-jerk reaction to Bitcoin has been severe. Tread
carefully and be nimble when it comes to investing. Check with your lawyer if you have to, but
even if you do not agree with the law, you have to follow it.
Conclusion
Cryptocurrencies are made possible by the distributed ledger that is kept honest by an
independent system called the blockchain. The idea of the blockchain is to harness the power of
the crowd to automatically verify and remember. These nodes are central to the blockchain
network and provide a valuable service.
As far as the blockchain is concerned, it is in its infancy. There is a long way to go before you
start to see the real power of the blockchain, but if the start is any indication, it will be safe to say
that the short-term benefits of using the blockchain in a lot of other distributed technologies
would be extremely beneficial.
Cryptocurrency has got a bad rap from those who do not understand it and those who are
threatened by it – be that threat real or perceived. They like to throw Bitcoin and the blockchain
into the category of criminal activity. I don’t buy that for one second. Privacy is the bedrock of
our democracy, but that privacy has been eroded slowly in the name of security and where has
that got us? Events like that of advanced psychographic manipulation on social media, and even
large scale monitoring by the powers that be.
The blockchain has become the core of a number of diverse technologies; even companies such
as IBM have started to dive into it in a big way. Cloud storage companies are looking at
blockchain technologies to be able to perfect distributed storage that is virtually impossible to
destroy or hack.
Take, for instance, a company that is combining the utility of distributed file storage and the
versatility of cryptocurrency and creating a token out of it. I am only bringing that up here
because I want to show you how diverse blockchains can be.
The way this works is that the blockchain is created by nodes in the system and all the nodes in
the system contribute a percentage of their hard drive to the network. In turn, what they do is
store some of their contents on the network that is kept track of by a blockchain. The blockchain
charges those who store data and then takes that data, encrypts it, and breaks it up into small
fragments and scatters it across the network. When a user wants to retrieve it, he just has to enter
his private key and he gets access to all his data that is brought back to him using BitTorrent
technology for downloads.
Those who want to use this service purchase a cryptocurrency or token (like Bitcoin) and then
pay that token on a periodic basis for the service to store the data. The person providing the harddrive space gets a portion of income each time his drive space is used. The person using it
automatically depletes his coin reserve as it goes to the administrator of the blockchain and the
nodes that are storing the data.
The income for the nodes is almost automatic and on autopilot. They just need to keep their
computer on and, as time goes by, the coin that is paid for the storage accumulates over time.
The point of this example is two-fold. The first, to exhibit the flexibility and nature of
blockchains, and the second, to introduce the next wave of distributed apps that will be built on
blockchains and parallel the token and coin market.
The larger the coin and token market expand, the more that results in the advance of Bitcoin. It
somehow seems that the entry point for a number of the cryptocurrencies is the Bitcoin; and the
exchange for these tokens and coins has become quite vibrant, and do not show any signs of
slowing down.
Your interest in the blockchain and the coin above it, is one probably driven by smart intuition
and should be promoted. You should advance your interest in this because it is the start of a new
paradigm in commerce and finance.
There are a few other areas that you should look into if you want to take this business seriously.
There are issues in cryptocurrency mining that you may want to advance. There is a huge
industry out there that is in its nascent stages. On the other hand, if you are more the trading type
and are not to savvy with the technical aspects of things, then maybe cryptocurrency trading
could be something that you could get into. Bitcoin trading has tremendous potential because it is
a volatile market and program traders love to trade with volatile markets because there are profits
to be made in either direction and there is a large amount of arbitrage opportunity as well.
If mining and trading is not your thing, but you are in other areas of technology, you can also
think of the ICO option ICOs are Initial Coin Offerings and they are ways to raise capital by
issuing crypto-assets.
There are numerous areas that you can get into to take up the opportunity that is present in this
vast, new field of cryptocurrencies. You did the absolute right thing by starting with this book to
get an idea of the blockchain technology that sits under the crypto-asset that rides on top.
Blockchains will revolutionize the Internet and change the face of it. The signs are already afoot,
and what remains are the passage of time and the flow of ideas. The larger institutional edifices
are starting to crumble in the face of the blockchain technology and the implementation of it will
be nothing short of revolutionary. The movement from centralized architectures to decentralized
ones will be in full force within the end of this century, and it will form the backbone of the
internet of things. It will also serve as the preferred route of deployment for Artificial
Intelligence and, together, AI, blockchains and the Internet of Things will be the way of the
future. Welcome to a new world.
