Introduction
A healthy diet is key to having a happy, fulfilling life. A diet too full of
unhealthy foods results in fatigue and vulnerability to diseases, many of them
serious. Unfortunately, our society is not lacking in unhealthy options. To
meet demand, companies turn to unethical methods, resulting in animal
cruelty. Health and the treatment of animals are two of the main reasons why
people commit to veganism, a plant-based diet that also eliminates animal
products like milk, cheese, gelatin, and honey.
Getting the most nutrition out of every food is very important for vegans, and
that’s where pressure cooking shines. Pressure cookers are able to retain the
most nutrition possible from vegetables and beans, and the appliance makes
healthy cooking extremely easy. While there are packaged vegan options,
making your own meals is always the healthy alternative, and much less
expensive. This book presents the first steps in becoming a vegan, and
provides 100 recipes for breakfasts, entrees, sides, desserts, and more, so you
have a strong foundation to build off of.
Whether you’re already a vegan and just need more recipe options, or have
just started considering transitioning your diet, this book will give you
everything you need to succeed.
Chapter 1 - What’s Vegan Cooking All
About?
Veganism has become very popular in recent times, as people realize just
how unhealthy society’s eating habits have become. We are a meat-loving
culture, and sadly, go to unethical lengths to get the meat we crave. Because
of health concerns, ethical concerns, or both, more people are deciding to
give up meat and, differing from vegetarians, all animal products. Their diet
shifts to one based on whole grains, vegetables, fruit, beans, nuts, seeds, and
vegan versions of popular foods.
When did veganism start?
Evidence for veganism has existed for 2,000 years, but the movement didn’t
have an official platform until the 1940’s. Donald Watson, an English
vegetarian who did not consume dairy, met with five others who shared his
vision to talk through ways to spread their message. They disliked the label
“non-dairy vegetarians,” because it was clunky, and ended up deciding on
“vegans.” The Vegan Society was born. Watson is considered the father of
modern veganism, and until his death at age 95, he advocated for organic
farming and pacifism.
What are the benefits of veganism?
A diet free from all animal products has a lot of benefits. Just a handful
include:
• More energy
• Healthier skin, hair, and nails
• Fewer migraines
• Fewer colds and flus
• Improved heart health
• Improved resistance to cancer
While studies have shown that veganism can lead to a lower BMI, it should
not be adopted purely for the sake of weight loss. “Vegan” does not mean
“lower-calorie,” and other healthy habits like exercise and drinking water
should accompany the diet if you want to lose weight.
Chapter 2 - How to Transition to a Vegan
Diet
Wanting to become a vegan? How would you go about it? There are really
only two steps when you break it down: adding food, and then cutting out
food and replacing it.
When you’re starting out on your vegan journey, the easiest first step is to
start adding food into your diet rather than cutting it out. That means buying
more fruits, vegetables, whole grains, beans, tofu, nuts, and so on. You start
making vegan recipes alongside non-vegan ones, and familiarizing yourself
with vegan brands. This way, you can see just how many options you do
have, and figuring out what you do and don’t like, without feeling like you’re
starving.
Once you’ve been adding vegan food to your diet for a little while, it’s time
to start cutting out food. The good thing about this step is you don’t have to
say goodbye to them entirely. What you do is cut out, and then replace. That
means instead of drinking milk, you start getting dairy alternatives like soy,
almond, or even cashew milk. Instead of regular cheese, find a vegan cheese
brand.
The art of substitution is key to being a vegan with a varied diet. Here are
some classic subs that vegans rely on:
Eggs
For cooking, crumbled tofu is very similar in texture to scrambled eggs. For
baking, subs include applesauce, flax eggs, and mashed bananas. As a binder,
oat and soy flour, rolled oats, bread crumbs, potato flakes, and cornstarch
work well.
Beef/chicken stock
Veggie stock is the obvious alternative, and many vegan food brands make
stocks that taste like chicken or beef.
Butter
Vegetable oils and vegan margarines (like Earth Balance) are popular.
Yogurt
There are soy and coconut oil yogurts with different flavors that can be eaten
straight or used in baking.
Gelatin
Used in baking, gelatin can be replaced with agar powder or agar flakes.
Stocking a vegan pantry
What does a vegan’s pantry and fridge look like? When you go to the store,
what should you stock up on? Here is a sample list you can use as a
reference, so if you ever feel like you’re running out of options, take a look
back and see how varied a vegan diet can really be.
Canned/dry beans (especially lentils and chickpeas)
Whole grains/flours (quinoa, brown rice, white rice, almond flour,
all-purpose flour, rolled oatmeal, steel-cut oats, seitan)
Nuts (walnuts, cashews, almonds, pine nuts)
Dried fruit (dates, dried cranberries, prunes, raisins)
Fresh fruit (whatever is in season, bananas, apples, lemons)
Fresh vegetables (whatever is in season)
Canned/frozen vegetables (tomatoes, corn, carrots, peas, green beans)
Non-dairy milks (almond milk, soy milk)
Pickled vegetables (jalapenos, pickles
Tofu/Tempeh
Bread
Apple cider vinegar
Cornstarch
Vegetable broth
Nutritional yeast
Miso/Tahini
Maple syrup
Agave syrup
Sugar
Coconut oil
Olive oil
Ground flax seeds
Dark chocolate
Nut butters
Salsa
Tortilla chips
Balsamic vinegar
Dried herbs and seasonings
A lot of vegans like to be oil-free if possible, so there are a bunch of recipes
in this book that do not contain coconut oil, olive oil, and so on.
These are clearly marked (Oil Free), so you can quickly see in the Table of
Contents what recipes are available.
Chapter 3 - The Electric Pressure Cooker Is
a Vegan’s Dream
A vegan really cannot do without an electric pressure cooker. Time and time
again, pressure cookers have been proven to be the best way to cook food
when nutritional value is the highest priority. This is because pressure
cookers are so fast, and the faster something cooks, the more nutrition is
retained. Fruits, veggies, beans, and whole grains - the types of food that a
vegan lives off - keep nearly 100% of their nutrients.
There are so many choices when it comes to electric pressure cookers, and
many are very affordable while still being designed for years of use. The
price tends to go up the more preset programs you get, and not every cooker
will have a yogurt setting. The larger the cooker, the more expensive it tends
to be, as well. Which one you choose depends on what you plan to cook with
it and how many people you would like to be able to feed without making
multiple batches.
Using the Electric Pressure Cooker
Electric pressure cookers are not hard to figure out. They consist of three
main parts: the lid, the inner pot, and the base. The lid is the most important
part of the cooker, because it is designed to provide the airtight seal that
allows pressure to build and the boiling point of water to go up. The lid has a
steam release handle, which needs to be in the “sealing” position when you’re
cooking. When the recipe is complete and it calls for a “quick-release” or
“manual release,” you turn the handle to “venting.” If the recipe calls for a
“natural release,” it means you turn off the cooker and wait for the pressure to
come down on its own. Want to know if the pressure is all gone? Look at the
float valve, which is a little pin on the lid that is either up or down. Up means
there’s still pressure, while down means you can open the pot.
The inner pot of the pressure cooker is where the food actually cooks. It’s
basically just like your other pots, nothing too special or technological about
it.
The base is the cooker’s brain. The control panel is where you set all your
pressures and times and what not. Most electric pressure cookers have these
buttons and programs, or ones very similar. It looks intimidating, but it’s
pretty self-explanatory:
Sauté: You’ll be using this setting a lot in this book. You use it whenever you
need to cook aromatics (onions, garlic, herbs, etc.) or brown something. This
is a non-pressurized setting, which means you keep the lid off.
Keep Warm/Cancel: Another setting you’ll get to know well. Hitting
“cancel” will turn off your pressure cooker or reset it, if you hit the wrong
button. You can also use this setting to keep the food in your cooker warm
until you’re ready to serve.
Manual: You pretty much use this button every time in the recipes. When
you hit this, you then choose the pressure you want and length of time you’ll
be cooking.
The “-” and “+” buttons: You hit one of these two buttons after hitting
“manual,” so you can adjust to the proper cooking time. You can also select
these buttons after choosing a specific program, because there are default
times on those, and you don’t necessarily want to use them.
Pressure: After choosing your cooking time, you can hit this button to
specify what pressure (low or high) you want to use.
Soup: This program sets the cooker for high pressure for 30 minutes.
Meat/Stew: This program sets the cooker for preparing meats for high
pressure for 35 minutes. You won’t have to worry about this one.
Poultry: Sets the cooker for chicken, turkey, etc. on high pressure for 15
minutes.
Beans/Chili: Sets the cooker for beans and chili on high pressure for 30
minutes.
Rice: Sets cooker on low pressure. The electric pressure cooker selects its
own cooking time depending on the amount of rice and water you have in the
pot.
Multi-grain: Sets the cooker for grains on high pressure for 40 minutes.
Porridge: Sets the cooker for porridge on high pressure for 20 minutes.
Steam: Sets the cooker for 10 minutes on high pressure.
Yogurt: Used only for starting a yogurt cycle on the electric pressure cooker.
Slow Cook: Sets cooker to operate like a slow cooker.
Even with all those programs, we will really only use a max of four in these
recipes: “Sauté,” “Manual,” “Cancel,” and the “-” and “+” buttons. The only
time this will be different is if the recipe calls for low pressure. Then you will
use the “Steam” setting or, if your pressure cooker has one, “Pressure Level.”
If your pressure cooker doesn`t have a “sauté” setting, any of the preset
buttons work. You just want to get your cooker hot to cook your ingredients.
If your cooker doesn`t have the “Manual” setting, you can use any of the
preset buttons, and then adjust to the time you want using the “+” or “-”
buttons.
When time is up, hit “cancel” or “stop.”
When you make a recipe, you’ll notice references to a steamer basket or
trivet. These are essentials for any pressure cooker, because a lot of food
should not directly touch the bottom of the cooker while cooking, or it will
burn. Steamer baskets and trivets perform the same function, so it really
doesn’t matter which you use, if you don’t want to get both.
The next chapter will go over how to clean your pressure cooker, so you can
keep using it for years to come.
Chapter 4 - Maintaining the Electric
Pressure Cooker
Like any piece of kitchen equipment, you should take good care of your
electric pressure cooker if you want to make the most of it. Luckily, cleaning
the pot is pretty easy. The outside can get dusty and grimy with food stuff, so
just wipe down with a paper towel and spray solution. To avoid lingering
odors, keep the lid off the cooker when not in use.
The main part you’ll have to clean is the actual inner pot, where the food
goes. You wash this like you would any saucepan, and if you want, you can
put it in the dishwasher. If you wash by hand right away, however, you can
use the pot again right away, and food doesn’t harden. Plain ol’ soap and hot
water is all that’s needed, and a soft sponge, as anything abrasive will scratch
the stainless steel.
The lid should also be cleaned, and there are two specific parts on it that can
be tricky. There is a metallic “plug” on the inside of the lid that foamy foods
can get into. This is the anti-block shield, and it does come off the lid. Don’t
twist it, just pull. It may seem like it’s not going to come off, so be careful
and pull hard. Clean the inside of the guard, and with a knitting needle (or
something else made of metal and thin enough to fit in the hole), just poke
inside the tiny valve.
The second part of the lid that should be washed is the silicone ring or, more
officially, the gasket. Just rub it with some soap and warm water. If it starts to
smell or stain, soak for at least 15 minutes. Gaskets wear out over time, so
eventually you have to buy a new one. The last part of the lid that can be
cleaned is the float valve. It has a tiny silicone ring on it that can absorb

Before we move on to the recipes, it’s important to make a note about time.
The cooking time for any given recipe can vary a lot depending on what
altitude you live in. High altitudes mean a longer cooking time. Because of
this, the cooking time listed in the recipes does not factor in the length of
time it takes for the cooker to actually reach pressure, the time represents how
long the cooker stays at pressure.

Pear Oats with Walnuts
Serves: 4
Time: 6 minutes
Rolled oats are one of the fastest cooking foods with the pressure cooker. For
this recipe, you mix everything in a bowl, which sets in the steamer rack in
the cooker. The oats cook in almond milk, sugar, and just a tablespoon of
coconut oil. Fresh pears will soften beautifully in there, as well, and you
finish it off with cinnamon and walnuts.
Ingredients:
2 cups almond milk
2 cups peeled and cut pears
1 cup rolled oats
½ cup chopped walnuts
¼ cup sugar
1 tablespoon melted coconut oil
¼ teaspoon salt
Dash of cinnamon
Directions:
1. Mix everything except the walnuts and cinnamon in an oven-safe
bowl that you know fits in the pressure cooker.
2. Pour 1 cup of water into the pressure cooker and lower in steamer
rack.
3. Put the bowl on top and lock the lid.
4. Select “manual,” and then high pressure for 6 minutes.
5. When time is up, quick-release the pressure.
6. Carefully remove the bowl, divide into 4 servings, and season with
salt and cinnamon.

Banana-Buckwheat Porridge (Oil Free)
Serves: 3-4
Time: 26 minutes (6 minutes cook time, 20 minutes natural release)
Buckwheat is a good oat-alternative if you’re sensitive to gluten. It’s also
high in fiber and has comparable health benefits to fruits and veggies!
Because of its texture, buckwheat takes a little longer to cook than rolled
oats, so you need to do a natural pressure release to make sure it’s soft
enough.
Ingredients:
3 cups almond (or rice) milk
1 cup buckwheat groats
1 sliced banana
¼ cup raisins
1 teaspoon cinnamon
½ teaspoon pure vanilla extract
Directions:
1. Rinse off the buckwheat and put right in the pressure cooker.
2. Pour in the milk, and add the rest of the ingredients.
3. Lock the lid.
4. Select “manual,” and then cook for 6 minutes on high pressure.
5. When time is up, hit “cancel” and wait 20 minutes or so for the
pressure to go all the way down.
6. Open the lid and stir well. Add more milk if it’s too thick for you.
7. Serve!

Pumpkin Spice Oatmeal w/ Brown Sugar Topping
(Oil Free)
Serves: 6-8
Time: 15 minutes (3 minutes cook time, 12 minutes natural release)
If someone tells you that vegan food is bland, serve them this breakfast and
they’ll change their mind. It uses steel-cut oats, pumpkin puree, cinnamon,
and allspice. The brown sugar, chopped pecan topping is just as delicious and
adds a nice crunch.
Cooking Tip: If you like really soft oats, cook for at least 7 minutes
instead of 3.
Ingredients:
4 ½ cups water
1 ½ cups steel-cut oats
1 ½ cups pumpkin puree
2 teaspoons cinnamon
1 teaspoon vanilla
1 teaspoon allspice
½ cup brown sugar
¼ cup chopped pecans
1 tablespoon cinnamon
Directions:
1. Pour 1 cup water into the pressure cooker.
2. Add everything from the first ingredient list (including rest of the
water) into an oven-safe bowl and set in the steamer basket.
3. Lower basket into the pressure cooker and lock the lid.
4. Select “manual,” and cook on high pressure for 3 minutes.
5. When time is up, hit “cancel” and wait for the pressure to come down
on its own.
6. Mix the topping ingredients in a small bowl.
7. When you serve, sprinkle on top. If necessary, add a little almond
milk to the oats.

Chai-Spiced Oatmeal with Mango (Oil Free)
Serves: 2-3
Time: 13 minutes (3 minutes cook time, 10 minutes natural release)
A fan of chai tea? This oatmeal mimics those spicy-sweet flavors with
cinnamon, ginger, cloves, and cardamom. The measurements are in “dashes,”
because it’s up to you how much of each spice you want, depending on your
tastes. Top the bowl off with some fresh-cut mango, or whatever fruit you
like.
Cooking Tip: Cardamom and cloves are really strong, so add a teeny
amount and taste.
Ingredients:
3 cups water
1 cup steel-cut oats
½ teaspoon vanilla
Dash of cinnamon
Dash of ginger
Dash of cloves
Dash of cardamom
Dash of salt
½ mango, cut into pieces
Directions:
1. Mix water and oats in the pressure cooker.
2. Close the lid.
3. Select “manual,” and cook for 3 minutes on high pressure.
4. When the beeper sounds, hit “cancel” and wait for the pressure to
come down naturally.
5. Open the lid and stir well.
6. Season and taste.
7. Divide into even servings and add chopped mango.

Coconut-Almond Risotto (Oil Free)
Serves: 4
Time: 20 minutes (10 minutes cook time, 10 minutes natural release)
Risotto is usually reserved for savory side dishes, but it’s a perfect vehicle for
sweeter breakfasts, too. Using vanilla almond milk and coconut milk adds
flavor and a beautiful creaminess. For texture, a topping of coconut flakes
and sliced almonds is perfect.
Ingredients:
2 cups vanilla almond milk
1 cup coconut milk
1 cup Arborio rice
⅓ cup sugar
2 teaspoons pure vanilla
¼ cup sliced almonds and coconut flakes
Directions:
1. Pour the milks into the pressure cooker and hit the “sauté” button.
2. Stir until it boils.
3. Add the rice and stir before locking the lid.
4. Select “manual,” and cook for 5 minutes on high pressure.
5. When time is up, press “cancel” and wait 10 minutes. Quick-release
any leftover pressure.
6. Add the sugar and vanilla.
7. Divide up oats and top with almonds and coconut.

Soy Yogurt (Oil Free)
Makes: 8 cups
Time: 12 hours to make + 6 hours in fridge before eating
Vegan yogurt? Yes, it’s possible. It’s a lot of waiting, but very little work. To
make this recipe, you’ll need an electric pressure cooker which has the
Yogurt program. To ensure this yogurt is vegan, make sure to get a soymilk
that only lists water and soybeans in the ingredients.
Ingredients:
2 quarts of soy milk
1 packet of vegan yogurt culture
Directions:
1. Mix milk and yogurt culture together.
2. Pour into a heatproof container that you know fit in your pressure
cooker. Leave off any lids.
3. Put into the cooker. You do not need to add any water to the pot
because it doesn’t actually rise to pressure!
4. Close the lid and select the “yogurt” button. Adjust time to 12 hours
for a professional-quality thick, creamy yogurt.
5. Go about your business until time is up, and then take out the yogurt.
6. Put the lids on the containers and store in the fridge for at least 6
hours.
7. The yogurt will be very tangy, so sweeten with vanilla, sugar, jam,
fruit, and so on!

Banana-Amaranth Porridge (Oil Free)
Serves: 4
Time: 13 minutes (3 minutes cook time, 10 minutes natural release)
Amaranth is an ancient “grain,” though it technically isn’t a grain at all. It’s
basically a bud, but has similar health benefits to other cereals, and it makes a
darn tasty hot porridge. This recipe uses no added sugar; bananas add the
sweetness.
Ingredients:
2 ½ cups unsweetened almond milk
1 cup amaranth
2 sliced bananas
Dash of cinnamon
Directions:
1. Mix the amaranth, milk, and bananas in your pressure cooker.
2. Seal the lid.
3. Select “manual,” and cook on high pressure for just 3 minutes.
4. When time is up, hit “cancel” and wait for the pressure to come down
on its own.
5. When all the pressure is gone, you can serve the porridge with
cinnamon.

you’re using frozen veggies. Using boiling water helps with that, and if
you use fresh veggies, it takes very little time to get to pressure)

3 cups boiling water

1 15-ounce can of white beans
1 15-ounce can of fire-roasted diced tomatoes
1 15-ounce can of pinto beans

Steamed Artichokes
Serves: 6
Time: 33 minutes (10 minutes prep time, 5 minutes cook time, 15 minutes
dry time, 3 minutes fry time)
Artichokes are one of the healthiest veggies out there, but their intimidating
hard bodies put a lot of people off. The prep is totally worth the result,
especially when you can steam the artichokes to perfection in your pressure
cooker. After cooking, you finish them off with a little frying in a separate
skillet.
Ingredients:
6 long, narrow artichokes
3 smashed garlic cloves
2 cups water
1-2 cups of olive oil
Juice of 1 lemon
1 sliced lemon
1 tablespoon whole peppercorns
Directions:
1. Pour 2 cups of water, lemon juice, lemon slices, and peppercorns in
your pressure cooker.
2. Prep artichokes by tearing off the tough leaves on the outside, peeling
the stem, cutting off the end of the stem, and cutting the top half off
of the leaves horizontally, so you end up with what looks like a hat.
3. Pry open the leaves and take out the hairy, hard part to access the
heart, leaving the dotty part where the hairy part was attached.
4. Open the leaves up a bit more and dip in the pressure cooker, head
down, and swirl around before putting in the steamer basket.
5. Put basket with artichokes in the pressure cooker.
6. Close and seal lid.
7. Select “manual” and cook on high pressure for 5 minutes.
8. When time is up, quick-release the pressure after hitting “cancel.”
9. Shake the artichokes and put in a strainer for 15 minutes to dry out.
10. In a pan, heat up about 2 centimeters of oil and just fry the artichokes
head down until their edges start to turn golden.
11. Plate and dab with a paper towel to remove excess oil before serving.

purple nutrition bombs go really well with ingredients like garlic, rice wine
vinegar, and capers. It’s nice to have a salad option that doesn’t involve
greens.
Ingredients:
4 medium-sized beets

1 garlic clove
2 tablespoons capers
1 tablespoon of chopped parsley
1 tablespoon olive oil

pressure.
8. Beets should be soft enough to pierce with a fork.

A traditional Middle Eastern spread, hummus can be expensive when you get
it in the store, and there are always listeria recalls going on. That’s not very
delicious. Thankfully, you can make your own hummus in the pressure

and prefer it to be a bit more mild. Remember - you have to soak dry
chickpeas overnight.

cooking liquid.
9. Remove the bay leaf before pureeing the chickpeas.

8. Select “manual” and cook on high pressure for 5 minutes.
9. When the beeper sounds, hit “cancel” and carefully quick-release.
10. Turn the pot back to the lowest setting of “sauté,” and cook for 1
hour.

13. Pour sauce into 1-pint jars (putting one bay leaf at the bottom of the
jar) and close.

Lentil Bolognese (Oil Free)
Serves: 4-6
Time: 30 minutes (5 minutes prep time, 15 minutes cook time, 10 minutes

Bolognese is traditionally a meaty tomato sauce, so for the vegan version,
you replace meat with black lentils. These add a hearty texture, as well as
tons of nutritional value. Ingredients like fire-roasted tomatoes, lots of garlic,
and a little balsamic vinegar at the very end make the sauce taste like it’s
been simmering for hours, when in reality, the whole process only takes
about a half hour.
Ingredients:
4 cups water
1 cup washed black lentils
1, 28-ounce can of fire-roasted tomatoes
4 minced garlic cloves
3 diced carrots
1 diced yellow onion
1 can tomato paste
¼ cup balsamic vinegar
2 tablespoons Italian seasoning
Red pepper flakes
Salt and pepper

cashews. Nutritional yeast has a naturally-cheesy flavor, while cashews
imitate the texture of cheese in cooking when they’re blended. To make a
“cheese” sauce you can use on just about anything, cook nutritional yeast and
cashews in your pressure cooker, along with some potatoes, carrots, onion,
and seasonings.
Ingredients:
2 cups peeled and chopped white potatoes
2 cups water
1 cup chopped carrots
3 peeled, whole garlic cloves

Sage-Butternut Squash Sauce
Serves: 4
Time: 30 minutes (10 minutes prep time, 10 minutes cook time, 10 minutes

1 chopped yellow onion
2 chopped garlic cloves
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon chopped sage
⅛ teaspoon red pepper flakes

Spicy Eggplant Sauce
Serves: 4-6
Time: 20 minutes (5 minutes prep time, 15 minutes cook time)
Earthy eggplant spiced with red pepper flakes makes for a great sauce. It’s
always nice to have sauce options that aren’t tomato-based, but still have that
satisfying richness. To make enough sauce, look for big eggplants, and plan
on adding an extra half hour to the total time if you’re going to follow the
cooking tip about reducing bitterness.
Cooking Tip: If you find eggplant bitter, put the cubes in a strainer with
some salt, and put a heavy plate on top of the cubes for at least a half
hour. This will squeeze out the bitter juice.
Ingredients:
2 big, cubed eggplants
2 tablespoons olive oil
½ cup water
1 smashed garlic clove
1 tablespoon dry oregano
1-3 pinches of red pepper flakes
Sea salt to taste
Directions:
1. Prep your eggplants.
2. Sprinkle with a little salt.
3. Add oil, garlic, one pinch of pepper flakes, and oregano to your
pressure cooker.
4. Turn the “keep warm” setting on and stir around for about 5 minutes.
5. If the oil starts to bubble, unplug the cooker.
6. Take out the garlic.
7. Brown half of the eggplant cubes in salt and pepper in your cooker on
the “sauté” setting.
8. Add the rest of the eggplant and garlic.
9. Mix before pouring in water.
10. Close and seal the lid.
11. Select “manual” and cook on high pressure for 3 minutes.
12. Hit “cancel” when time is up, and quick-release the pressure.
13. Immediately remove the eggplant and cool for a few minutes.
14. Blend until smooth.
15. Add more red pepper flakes if you want the sauce spicier, and serve!

Substituting cauliflower for dairy when you’re making a cream sauce

nutritional yeast.
Ingredients:
12-ounces cauliflower florets
2 minced garlic cloves
½ cup water

Mashed potatoes are a family favorite during the holiday season, but with all

Cranberry Sauce (Oil Free)
Makes: 1 cup
Time: 18 minutes (3 minutes cook time, 5 minutes simmer time, 10 minutes
rest time)
Homemade cranberry sauce can be a real pain to make, but this recipe uses
dried cranberries that are reconstituted in your pressure cooker. If you’re
making sauce for a lot of people, you can double the recipe, but since you can
only fill your cooker ½-way full, you should make the sauce in batches if you
want more than 2 cups. Once in the fridge, the sauce will last up to a week.
Ingredients:
1 cup dried cranberries
¾ cup water
¾ cup cranberry juice cocktail
1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice
Directions:
1. Put all the ingredients in your pressure cooker.
2. Close and seal the lid.
3. Press “manual” and adjust time to 3 minutes.
4. When the beeper goes off, very slowly release the pressure through
the valve.
5. Pour sauce into a blender (or use a hand blender) to break up the
berries, but don’t puree entirely.
6. Simmer in the pot without the lid for 5 minutes while stirring to get
the texture you want.
7. Turn off the heat and let the sauce rest for 10 minutes.
8. Serve right away, or chill in the fridge.

Dried-Fruit Wild Rice
Serves: 6-8
Time: 50 minutes (30 minutes cook time, 20 minutes natural release)
Wild rice pairs really well with cranberries and other dried fruit for an earthy,
rustic holiday dish. It would also work really well as a stuffing or dressing.
It’s on the sweet side, but the black pepper helps offset that.
Cooking Tip: You can eat this rice as-is, or for a full meal, you can fill a
partially-baked butternut squash with the rice and bake for 30-45
minutes in a 350-degree oven.
Ingredients:
3 ½ cups water
1 ½ cups wild rice
1 cup dried, mixed fruit
2 peeled and chopped small apples
1 chopped pear
½ cup slivered almonds
2 tablespoons apple juice
1 tablespoon maple syrup
1 teaspoon veggie oil
1 teaspoon cinnamon
½ teaspoon ground nutmeg
Salt and pepper to taste
Directions:
1. Pour water into your pressure cooker along the rice.
2. Close and seal the lid.
3. Select “manual,” and cook for 30 minutes on high pressure.
4. While that cooks, soak the dried fruit in just enough apple juice to
cover everything.
5. After 30 minutes, drain the fruit.
6. By now, the rice should be done, so hit “cancel” and wait for the
pressure to come down on its own.
7. Drain the rice and move rice to a bowl.
8. Turn your pressure cooker to sauté and add veggie oil.
9. Cook the apples, pears, and almonds for about 2 minutes.
10. Pour in two tablespoons apple juice and keep cooking for a few
minutes more.
11. Add syrup, the cooked rice, soaked fruit, and seasonings.

Stewed Tomatoes + Green Beans
Serves: 4-6
Time: 10 minutes (5 minutes prep time, 5 minutes cook time)

canned tomatoes if you have to, though in my opinion, fresh is always better,
if it’s the season for it.

1 pound trimmed green beans
2 cups fresh, chopped tomatoes
1 crushed garlic clove
1 teaspoon olive oil
Salt
Directions:
1. Preheat your pressure cooker.
2. When warm, add 1 teaspoon of olive oil and garlic.
3. When the garlic has become fragrant and golden, add tomatoes and
stir.
4. If the tomatoes are dry, add ½ cup water.
5. Fill the steamer basket with the green beans and sprinkle on salt.
6. Lower into cooker.
7. Close and seal the lid.
8. Select “manual,” and cook for 5 minutes on high pressure.
9. When the timer beeps, turn off cooker and quick-release.

minutes.

Brussels Sprouts with Pine Nuts and Pomegranate
Serves: 4-6
Time: 13 minutes (10 minutes prep time, 3 minutes cook time)
When winter comes along, so do the Brussels sprouts. On their own, they’re a
little bland, so to dress things up, add toasted pine nuts and sour-sweet
pomegranates. There are layers of texture and flavor going on in this side
dish, and you only use a total of six ingredients counting salt and pepper.
Ingredients:
1 pound Brussels sprouts
Seeds of 1 pomegranate
¼ cup toasted pine nuts
Olive oil
Salt and pepper to taste

cauliflower-and-broccoli mix with a spicy orange vinaigrette.
Ingredients:
Florets from 1 small cauliflower
Florets from 1 small Romanesco cauliflower

Thanksgiving Stuffing (Oil Free)
Serves: 6
Time: 35 minutes (10 minutes prep time, 15 minutes cook time, 10 minutes
oven time)
Not only is this stuffing vegan, it’s gluten free. You use a mixture of almond
meal, almond milk, and fresh herbs instead of breadcrumbs. The stuffing
itself is a nutritious (and delicious) mix of carrots, onions, eggplant, apple,
and more. After cooking in the pressure cooker, you finish everything off in
the oven to give the stuffing a classic crispy texture.
Ingredients:
2-3 chopped carrots
3 chopped spring onions
2 chopped celery stalks
1 cubed eggplant
1 chopped fennel bulb
1 chopped apple
1 cup almond meal
½ cup almond milk + 1 tablespoon almond milk
1 tablespoon chopped fresh herbs
Salt and pepper to taste
Directions:
1. Mix almond meal, 1 tablespoon almond milk, and herbs in a bowl
and mix with your fingers until it becomes crumbly.
2. Mix the rest of your ingredients in a dish you know fits in the
pressure cooker, with ½ cup of almond milk poured on top.
3. Stir.
4. Pour 1 cup of water into your pressure cooker and put the dish inside,
on top of a trivet.
5. Close and seal the lid.
6. Select “manual” and cook on high pressure for 15 minutes.
7. When time is up, hit “cancel” and quick-release the pressure.

Maple Syrup-Sweetened Cornbread
Makes: 12-16 squares
Time: 54 minutes (2 minutes prep time, 22 minutes cook time, 30 minutes
natural release/cool time)
This cornbread is not too sweet, so it can be served with jam or something
savory, like smashed avocado or holiday stuffing. To make it, it’s a simple
process of mixing liquid ingredients, then dry, and then mixing them
together. A Bundt pan is a good choice, and it gives the cornbread a pretty
shape for the table.

2 cups cornmeal
2 cups soy milk
1 cup flour
⅓ cup veggie oil
2 tablespoons maple syrup
2 teaspoons baking powder
2 teaspoons apple cider vinegar

Time: 18 minutes (15 minutes prep time, 3 minutes cook time)
Pot pies are one of the best comfort foods. A flaky biscuit top hides a hot,
flavorful filling packed with veggies and seasonings. For this recipe, you
make individual pot pies, so everyone gets a whole biscuit to themselves.

1 minced garlic clove
½ medium yellow onion
¼ cup unsweetened almond milk
¼ cup flour

Corn Chowder
Serves: 6
Time: 31 minutes (10 minutes prep time, 6 minutes cook time, 15 minutes
natural release)
Corn chowder really brings out the awesome flavors of corn - the sweetness
and hint of nuttiness. Try this out when corn is in season at family gatherings,
and if you think it’s too hot for chowder, you can actually serve it chilled for
a refreshing take on the classic.
Cooking Tip: If you want to use fresh corn, you’ll need 5 ears, and you
actually put the cobs in the pressure cooker before you bring it to
pressure, giving the chowder a really true flavor.
Ingredients:
4 cups veggie broth
3 ½ cups of corn
1 cup coconut milk
3 minced garlic cloves
3 big chopped carrots
3 chopped Yukon Gold potatoes

7. When time is up, hit “cancel” and wait 15 minutes for the pressure to
come down.
8. In a small bowl, mix coconut milk with potato starch until smooth.
9. Add lime juice before pouring into the pot.
10. Turn your cooker back to “sauté” to activate the thickening process.
11. With a hand blender, process until smooth. If you need to use a
regular blender, puree the chowder before you add the coconut
milk/starch/lime mixture.
12. Season to taste if necessary. Serve hot or chilled.

Sweet Potato Casserole
Serves: 4
Time: 45 minutes (15 minutes cook time, 10 minutes natural release, 20

The longest part of this classic dish is cooking the sweet potatoes. With the
pressure cooker, it comes significantly shorter, and ensures all the vitamin A,
vitamin C, and antioxidants are all preserved. After mashing the potatoes
with a mixture of vegan oils, syrup, and spices, and topping it with sweetened
pecans and oats, you bake the dish in an oven to finish it off.

Peach Simple Syrup
Makes: About 1 cup
Time: 55 minutes (5 minutes cook time, 10 minutes natural release time, 30-
4o minutes boil time)
Simple syrup is a key ingredient in cocktails. A homemade jar is also a
fantastic hostess gift. Measurements are a bit up in the air - the key is to never
fill your pressure cooker more than halfway full with fruit and water, and
when you start to boil your mixture, you want to add twice as much sugar as
there is fruit extract, so always measure your fruit extract before adding
sugar.
Ingredients:
4 cups fresh, chopped peaches
2 cups water
2 cups sugar
Directions:
1. Pour peaches into your pressure cooker with water. Make sure it is no
more than halfway full.

Vegan Cheesecake w/ Raspberries
Serves: 6
Time: 24-38 minutes (10 minute prep time, 4-8 minute cook time, 10-20
minute natural pressure release)
Prep time is only officially 10 minutes for this creamy, rich vegan
cheesecake, but you will notice that the ingredients call for soaked dates and
cashews. To soak dates, submerge them in hot water for 30 minutes or so
until they are very soft. For the cashews, put them in a pot and cover with
water. Turn your burner on and bring the water to a rolling boil. Quickly
cover with a lid and remove from heat. After 15 minutes, drain. I like fresh
raspberries on my cheesecake, but you can substitute any favorite fruit.
Ingredients:
Crust
1 ½ cup almonds
½ cup soaked dates
Filling
1 ½ cup soaked cashews
½ cup firm silken tofu
¼ cup pure maple syrup
¼ cup unsweetened almond milk
½ lemon’s worth of zest and juice
1 teaspoon pure vanilla
Pinch of salt
Fresh raspberries
Directions:
1. Grease six ramekins with a coconut-oil based spray.
2. To make the crust, pulse almonds until you get a crumb texture.
3. Add dates and pulse until sticky and together.
4. Press crust down into your ramekins, and up the sides a little.
5. Stick in the fridge for now.
6. To make filling, add the rest of the ingredients to a blender and
pulse until smooth.
7. Divide among the ramekins and cover with foil.
8. Pour 1 ½ cups water into your pressure cooker and add trivet.
9. Set as many ramekins that fit on the trivet, and seal the lid.
10. Hit “manual” and cook for just 4 minutes.
11. When time is up, hit “cancel” and wait 10 minutes before quickreleasing.
12. Cheesecake will wobble a little, but the center should be set, like a
jello.
13. Repeat with any remaining ramekins.
14. Garnish with raspberries and enjoy!

siblings. It’s packed with antioxidants and iron, which is especially important
for vegans. It also has more fiber and protein than white, brown, or red rice.

with a cheesecloth of whole spices like cinnamon, cloves, and cardamom.

This isn’t your grandmother’s rice pudding, no offense to her. Instead of
white rice, we go with brown rice, which has more nutrients like fiber and

This cake classic doesn’t have a ton of ingredients, so it comes together with

Conclusion
I hope that this book has inspired you to try out more vegan recipes, even if
you aren’t a vegan or are still in the transitional phase where you’re adding
food, and not eliminating just yet. Being a vegan does not mean sacrificing
quality or diversity when it comes to food, so don’t let anyone discourage
you with comments about how you’re “missing out.”
A pressure cooker is the must-have tool for vegans. This book covered how
to use the cooker, how to keep it clean and well-maintained, and provided
cooking charts on the most common ingredients you’ll be using as a vegan.
Whether you’re making beans, lentils, pasta, oats, veggies, or fruit, the
pressure cooker is significantly faster than any other cooking method, and
preserves the most nutrition. It’s a double-win.
Your health should be a top priority. When you’re in good health, everything
else is easier. Vegan food prepared with a pressure cooker is the single best
way to improve your health without complicating your life. Please come back
to this book and its awesome recipes again and again to continue your vegan
journey. I love walking alongside you.
Index: Converting slow cooker recipes to
pressure cookers
If you’re reading this book, you’re probably a person who has used slow
cookers in the past, because you want to make cooking convenient. That
means you have lots of slow cooker recipes, and you don’t want them to go
to waste now that you’re using a pressure cooker. You can usually find
pressure cooker versions of just about any slow cooker recipe, but in case you
can’t, you can convert those recipes to a pressure cooker. Here’s how:
Step 1: The aromatics
Aromatics are the first ingredients you cook. They add flavor and depth to the
dish. Aromatics include herbs, whole spices, celery, garlic, carrots, and
onions. Look and see what aromatics the slow cooker recipe uses, and cook
those right at the beginning before following the rest of the recipe.
Step 2: The liquid
Pressure cookers need much less liquid than slow cookers. They basically
end with the amount of liquid that you started with. Find out how much liquid
the slow cooker recipe ends with, and put that in your pressure cooker, plus ½
cup.
Step 3: The cooking time
An easy rule for converting to pressure cooker time is to reduce the time
given in the slow cooker recipe by 2/3. It’s always better to go with a lower
time, because you can always cook underdone food more, while overcooked
food can’t be fixed.
Step 4: The amount of food
The last step is to see how full the slow cooker is. If following the slow
cooker recipe would result in your pressure cooker being more than ⅔ of the
way full (½ for pastas, rice, oatmeal, beans), you’ll need to cut the recipe
down or cook in separate batches.
Thank you so much for reading this book!
I hope the book was able to teach you how pressure cooking can
simplify your everyday life.
