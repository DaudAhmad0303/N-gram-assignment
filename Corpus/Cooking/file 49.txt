The Origins of Italian Cuisine
As a whole , Italy is comparatively a young country . The Kingdom of Italy was officially formed in 1861 through the unification of many existing city-states . The merging process took many years because not everyone was pleased with the idea of unifying . In 1871 , the official capital of Italy moved from Florence to Rome , and Italy became fully united . The republic known today emerged after World War II . 

Since Italy was formed by uniting several city-states and cultures , the history of Italian food can become more complex . Each region in Italy has its own culture with distinct food traditions and specialties . While some of these distinctions have faded over time , many food traditions still differentiate regions . 

Many external factors played a role in the dishes created by each region and the availability of ingredients . Arabic culture also influenced Italy in many ways and helped shape Italian cuisine . As different cultures introduced new ingredients and spices to Italy from the New World , Italians began to add more variety and diversity to their dishes . Although , as a general rule , Italian dishes today can be simple and tend to focus on two to four primary ingredients . 

Cuisine in the Roman Empire and the Middle Ages
Cuisine in the Roman Empire and the Middle Ages
In the early years , food in Italy was more experimental and diverse than the traditional food practices you can expect today . Introduction to new ingredients and spices allowed Italians to try new dishes , and invading nations brought their own culinary influences . 

New ideas and religion also impacted the foods people in Italy could eat and how they prepared their meals . Extreme shifts in ideology between the Roman Empire and Italy in the Middle Ages led to varying food practices . 

Food in the Roman Empire
The Romans loved to experience life in excess . The Roman upper class valued extravagant parties and long nights of drinking wine and gorging on fine foods . The rich hosted lavish parties that required long days of preparation and complex ingredients . 

The Roman culinary style was a fusion of many different flavors . Romans enjoyed incorporating new spices and ingredients from the lands they conquered into their cooking . Mediterranean seafood , spices from the Middle East , grains from Northern Africa and various meats were popular in traditional Roman dishes . 

With its wide availability , wines , grains and olive oil became three staples of Roman cooking . The fertile soil also allowed Romans access to plenty of cheeses , vegetables and legumes . 

As the Roman Empire waned , invading northern tribes also brought butter and beer into the north part of what is now Italy . This process led to a distinct northern Italian cuisine . 

Italian Cuisine in the Early Middle Ages
During the Middle Ages , the rise of Christianity influenced what was considered acceptable to eat . The Church imposed new rules about what people should eat , and meat became associated with immorality . Extravagant banquets were renounced while fasting and abstinence increased in popularity , especially among the clergy . 

Up until the year 1000 , Italian monks ( and much of Europe ) were under a strict diet of bread and legumes , with an occasional indulgence in cheese and eggs and seasonal fruit . 

On the other hand , Sicily was under Arab control at this time and experienced a much different influence . The Arabs introduced Sicilians to various spices , dried fruit and dried herbs . The Arabic rulers brought pasta to Sicily for convenience , and the Italians took the food and transformed it into an art . Pasta quickly rose in popularity and spread to Napes and Genoa and eventually other European nations including , France and Spain . 

Food in Italy During the Late Middle Ages 
Toward the end of the Middle Ages , life ( and food ) began to blossom in Italy once again . New cultural ideas and early productive cores supported the rise of a new social class called the bourgeoisie . The bourgeoisie was an upper middle class that contributed to an increase in demand from artisans . The Crusades increased communication between neighboring nations , and commerce within and outside Italy ’ s borders expanded . 

Pleasure foods reemerged as a social and economic status symbol , and cooking became more of an act of enjoyment and refinement . Citizens braised meats and vegetables and dressed them in rich , flavorful sauces and dressings for indulgent meals . 

Italian Cuisine During the Renaissance
Italian Cuisine During the Renaissance
The Renaissance was a time of revival and rebirth . Art , music , literature , poetry and food flourished during this era . In Italy , one of the defining characteristics of the Renaissance was that humanism developed and quickly spread throughout Europe . Important Italian figures such as Francesco Petrarca and Giovanni Boccaccio also rose to fame . 

Italian food in this era expanded its roots , and new traditions arose . 

Tuscany During the Renaissance
Tuscany had an essential role in the renaissance of modern Italian food , especially in the 14th century . The newly formed commerce , bourgeoisie and craftsmanship practices called for innovative and exciting cuisine refinement to help establish a symbol of their social and cultural status . Interest in experimentation with food reignited in this era , and new motivation arose in developing elite , quality foods . 

Tuscany was an ideal region to experiment with food as it had access to a wide range of diverse produce and fertile lands . The rolling hills in Siena and Florence produced copious amounts of olive oil , peas and cabbage . Lambs and calves were bred in a part of Tuscany that is still known for raising one of the best breeds of calves in the country . 

Local sellers and farmers converged at Florence ’ s market to sell and barter milk , cheeses , and eggs . Other Tuscan regions such as Chianti , Montalcino and Montepulciano grew in popularity for their exquisite red wines . 

During the Renaissance , Tuscany excelled in producing varieties of simple foods without heavy sauces . Soups and beans were essential ingredients , as were the spices basil , sage and rosemary . 

Typical Food in the Italian Renaissance
Food evolved and flourished throughout Italy during the Renaissance period , although there was a significant disparity between the wealthy and poor . 

Rome was home to the Pope , which was one of the wealthiest and most luxurious courts . The papal entourage embraced the idea of honoring the Lord at the table . Excess feasts were viewed as grand celebrations and symbols of status and importance rather than indulgent sins . Banquets included dishes such as roasted roes and pheasants , chicken cooked in sauces , cookies , pinenuts and even desserts such as marzipan and whipped cream . 

In Venice , La Serenissima held a monopoly of sugar import and production since the Crusades . Venice was also the sole importer of Oriental spices for the whole of Europe . In the Renaissance , these factors naturally influenced the evolution of food in Venice . Venice became associated with sugar and developed candied fruits and sugar sculptures . 

Smaller Italian towns thrived on agriculture and trade , creating simple dishes from the ingredients they had access to in their regions . Soups , bread and simple meat dishes were typical meals for most of the population . Potato gnocchi , tagliatelle and macaroni were all created in the Renaissance era . 

Italian Food in the 17th , 18th and 19th Centuries
The 17th , 18th and 19th centuries saw the development of more sophisticated cuisine in Italy . Italy was a leading nation in food innovation in Europe up until the 17th century , when France emerged as a fierce rival with powerful new foods and flavors . A strong rivalry sparked the motivation to define Italian foods and identify what Italian cuisine really means . 

Until this time , chefs had attempted creating a national , pan-regional cuisine ideal , which included various elements from each region . Eventually , this changed as chefs starting crafting regional dishes as a celebration of all their differences . This practice ignited modern Italian culinary tradition with a theme of unity within the variety . 

Italian Cuisine in the 17th and 18th Centuries
In the 17th century , chefs in Italy began to define Italian cuisine and focused on unifying Italian foods by celebrating regional differences and experimenting with more complex food arrangements . Tiramisu is believed to have originated in the 1600s . In fact , most of Italy ’ s most famous desserts are from this era , including torrone and zuppa del duca , or the duke ’ s pudding . 

One of the most important developments in Italian cuisine at this time was the first modern cooking books . In 1634 , Giovan Battista Critci published a text on southern cuisine , the first of its kind in Italian cooking tradition . Another essential text in the history of Italian cuisine was a recipe book published in several volumes by Antonio Latini . 

Formal Italian cookbooks paved the way for future generations to embrace tradition and follow age-old family recipes . 

The Evolution of Italian Food in the 19th Century 
The 19th century saw many changes throughout the world and in Italy . Italy finally officially united as a whole country , and breakthrough scientific research changed people ’ s eating habits . Technological innovations and advancements in organic fertilizers increased agricultural production , reducing prices and making more food accessible to the majority . 

Increased communications and the improving rail system made it easier to ship products across the country more efficiently . Sterilization and pasteurization practices also emerged in the late 1800s . These processes allowed Italians to pack and preserve meats and dairy for longer periods , lowering production costs and increasing accessibility . 

Each of these changes contributed to Italian cuisine developing more into the cultural phenomenon that it is today . More iconic Italian dishes were created in this era , including pesto , carbonara and the fan-favorite : pizza . 

Raffaele Esposito is credited with introducing Italians to the Margherita pizza after making it in honor of the Queen of Italy , Margherita di Savoia , in Naples . The recipe received nationwide attention , and pizza was shortly after adopted as one of Italy ’ s masterpieces .

The last two centuries have led to many changes and new developments in communication , technology , trade and transportation . These improvements made importing and exporting goods easier , and more people became aware of foreign foods and non-local recipes . 

Major cultural shifts and historical events , including war , depression and resurgence shaped the way Italy has cultivated and used food . Looking into the progress of Italian dishes in the 21st century , you can find many recipes , ingredients and cooking methods born out of previous traditions and regional specialties . 

Italian Cuisine Throughout World War I and World War II
World War I devastated Italy and caused a food shortage . Resources were limited , and many people lacked sufficient quantities of crucial nutrients , leading to severe deficiencies resulting in the spread of pellagra and other illnesses . After World War I , ideas of futurism influenced Italian art and , eventually , cuisine . Futurism attempted to embody efficiency , progress , creativity and movement , leading to several exciting new dishes . 

Before World War II broke out , Italy was under the fascist rule of Mussolini . Italians had to be frugal in every respect , especially with food . Cheap and flavorful dishes were the primary source of nourishment for many families . As war broke out , many ingredients such as sugar , coffee , salt and butter were rationed . Italians improvised and used substitutes to keep feeding their families familiar foods . 

Italian Food in the 1950s , 60s and 70s 
Post-World War II Italy was the start of what is considered contemporary Italian cuisine . New appliances such as refrigerators , gas cookers and ovens made cooking more convenient and efficient . Foods that were once regarded as extravagant now became more common in middle-class families , including chicken breast and veal . 

More cooking resources began pushing recipes optimized for convenience , simplicity and easy execution . The country was healthy and wealthy enough to focus on eating more rather than consuming enough to survive . 

As women entered the workforce , a new demand for quick , ready-made meals and processed foods arose . Fast food chains slowly entered the Italian market . This new addition to the Italian food scene inspired many chefs , home cooks and creators to retrace older traditions and go back to fresh ingredients and locally sourced foods , inspiring a new wave of reviving classic recipes . 

Italian Food Culture Today
Today , food remains a treasured aspect of Italian culture , although many Italians embrace new food practices from other countries . Recent years have witnessed the increased popularity of fusion cuisine , which combines food elements from two or more cultures for a new dish . 

Many Italian chefs today adhere to traditional recipes and keep the essence of Italian food history alive . Italian food traditions reflect Italy ’ s national history and bring Italians together on all occasions . 

The rest of the world still clings to traditional Italian food . With miles of crystal clear coastline , famous wines and delicious cuisine , Italy is a favorite travel destination among tourists all over the globe .
