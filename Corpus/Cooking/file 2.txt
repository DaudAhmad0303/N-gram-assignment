CHAPTER 1-
UNDERSTANDING THE
PALEO DIET
A lot of persons have heard of the
Paleo diet but do not really know
what it is. This diet is a high protein,
low sodium and low sugar which will
get an individual in the best state of
health. It is based on the diet that our
ancestors from the Paleolithic era
had. Though the main aim of the diet
is to promote health, it also works
great for weight loss. The individuals
that developed this diet are of the
belief that the cavemen that lived in
the Paleolithic or Stone Age era had
the best and most suitable diet for
man.
This is so because since that Ɵme our
genes have not changed much (only
0.01%) but the way in which we live
has changed by leaps and bounds. It is
thought that it is best that we revert
to that diet as all the food was fresh
and had no chemicals. Animals were
hunted and food was picked and
consumed. There was none of the
addiƟves, arƟficial flavorings or
preservatives that we have today.
During the Stone Age, there really was
no need for foods that had a longer
shelf life or any requirement for
instant foods. The need for these
things has only come about in recent
years as we have the ever increasing
need to have things easier for
convenience. With the addiƟons of
these chemicals some foods are no
longer as good for us as it used to be.
Even if we have natural food the
wrong porƟons are consumed posing
more of a risk to our health than
anything else.
This is the basis on which the Paleo
diet was created. It is meant to keep
us away from foods that are not good
for us and give food opƟons that can
provide all the nutrients that our
body needs. The cavemen had very
healthy lifestyles without the
conveniences of fast food that we
now have. The diet allowed our
ancestors to do their daily tasks which
were rather labor intensive and
required a lot of energy. They spent
their Ɵme walking for miles to pick
their food and hunt and all this was
possible because of the diet.
This diet has a high protein
component as the aim is to provide
the right amount of energy to carry
out tasks which are labor intensive. It
also has a lot of vegetables and fruits
which help provide the right amount
of nutrients and vitamins for the
body. These food groups can be
consumed without limits. In fact the
more that you can consume the
beƩer off you will be. The need to
take supplements will be reduced as
the diet will have all the necessary
nutrients.
T h e Paleo diet is low in sugar and
sodium as too much sugar and salt is
not good for the body. The cavemen
had this sort of diet because they did
have access to arƟficial sweeteners or
refined sugar and they did not cook in
the way that we do now so a lot of
salt was not needed to flavor dishes.
The diet really brings everything back
to basics. Through the consumption of
fresh vegetables, fruits and meat one
will be much healthier than if one
consumed boxed, canned, processed
and other foods including dairy which
did not exist in the Stone Age era.
CHAPTER 2- NOT
JUST ANOTHER LOWCARB DIET
There are a lot of things going on in
the body on a daily basis and a lot of
things get into our bodies that can
make our health deteriorate. Making
changes to the way in which you eat
can allow you to cleanse the body and
restore the body to premium working
condiƟon, lowering the risk of disease
while providing the body with the
necessary nutrients.
A list of the benefits of the Paleo diet
is listed below. It is:
A diet that is dense in nutrients
Low in carbohydrates and sugar
Low in artificial products
Easy to keep the balance in the
glucagon to insulin ratio
Free from the harmful effects of gluten
Free from the harmful effects of high
insulin
A great diet to achieve a lean body
mass
Great to promote acne free skin
The way to get relief from auto
immune diseases
The way to get relief from any disease
that is metabolic
The way to get relief from disease of
affluence
A way to increase energy
A way to better athletic performance
The best way to lower the risk for
autoimmune disease, gastrointesƟnal
disease, acne, arthriƟs, osteoporosis,
obesity, diabetes, heart disease,
cancer and much more.
The quesƟon can then be posed- how
exactly is the average diet harmful?
The average diet has quite a number
of harmful foods that we should not
be consuming. These include but are
not limited to:
Dairy (triggers acne and high levels of
insulin)
Grains (triggers high levels of insulin
and causes damage to the lining of
the intestine)
Alcohol (triggers high insulin response
and is highly toxic)
Sugar (any type of sugar will trigger
high levels of insulin)
Hormones (refrain from eaƟng
hormone injected meat)
Antibiotics (refrain from eaƟng meat
injected with anƟbioƟcs and if
possible avoid oral anƟbioƟcs and if
you have to then take probioƟcs aŌer
the course of anƟbioƟcs are
complete)
Genetically modified foods (GMO’s)
Artificial flavoring and coloring
Preservatives
Copious amounts of table salt
Sugar subsƟtutes or arƟficial sugar
(splenda, sweet ‘n’ low, equal- stevia
not included as it is an herb)
Trans-fats (hydrogenated fat that
clogs arteries)
How can the Paleo diet help?
Are you interested in losing weight?
The Paleo diet is a great balance of
protein, carbohydrates and fat. If you
are trying to lose weight or are
overweight it is best to refrain from
consuming a lot of oils, seeds and
buts. As soon as you have achieved
your ideal weight you can increase the
fat you consume.
If the problem is being overweight
then you should take a fish oil
supplement (one gram for every ten
pounds of body weight and point five
grams to maintain weight). When one
is overweight it also means that you
are in an inflammatory state. The
omega-3 which the fish oil is packed
with can help lower this level of
i n fl a mma Ɵo n . Note that the
consumpƟon of fat will not cause you
to gain more weight. You should also
eat to saƟsfy hunger not to be
extremely full. You will sƟll feel
hungry when you just begin but the
body will adapt aŌer a while. The
Paleo diet will also help you to
achieve the lean body mass that you
have always wanted to achieve and
the results will be accelerated if you
do some cross-fit training.
It is my belief that the Paleo diet
works and it can really change lives.
You will not only see the physical
changes that your body goes through
but you will also note that there is a
difference with how you feel. Your
body will be funcƟoning at its best
ever on a cellular level and you will
have increased longevity in addiƟon
to being healthier. The list of benefits
alone should indicate how much
better your health can be.
CHAPTER 3- LEAN
MEAT HELPS YOU
LOSE WEIGHT
Almost everyone is aware that lean
meats are needed to lose weight
quickly. This meat has a low fat
content and has a lot of protein that
is vital for the balanced diet. The
thermic effect of protein and the
length of Ɵme that it takes to digest
will help the body to burn addiƟonal
calories in the digesƟve process than
fat or complex carbohydrates ever
could.
How to Make the Selection
When selecƟng lean meat it is
essenƟal to be aware of what exactly
lean refers to. For example the United
States Department of Agriculture
(USDA) denotes that a single serving
of beef (lean) contains ten grams of
fat. That equates to ninety fat calories
with most of it being fat that is
saturated fat. The categorizaƟon for
beef that is extra lean sƟll includes
five grams (45 calories) of fat in each
serving. As such the categorizaƟon of
a parƟcular type of meat as lean does
not necessarily mean that it has a low
fat content.
What is Lean?
No maƩer what all types of meat will
contain some fat. Despite this the
most ideal types of lean meat contain
less than two grams of fat in each
serving. As a lot of the fat in meat is
saturated fat, it is best to keep the
level of fat to a minimum. To
guarantee that this happens, it is
essenƟal that you read the labels on
your food.
Best List of Lean Meats
Outlined below is a list of a few of the
most ideal lean meats that you can
buy. As there are various types of fish
you will have a greater selection.
The only requirement is that the meat
contains less than two grams of fat in
each serving. In order to obtain the
amount of fat that the body needs,
you can make use of fats that contain
high levels of poly and
monounsaturated fats.
Turkey Breast: one point four grams in
each serving
Chicken Breast: one point five grams in
each serving
Tuna: one gram in each serving
Grouper (Red Grouper): one gram in
each serving
Cod: one gram in each serving
Pinnacle (WhiƟng): one point two
grams in each serving
Ocean Perch (Redfish): one point six
grams in each serving
One final thing to menƟon is that lean
fish is a really great opƟon as it
contains omega 3 faƩy acids that are
an added bonus. In the diet we have
nowadays this is usually very low. The
omega 3 faƩy acids are beneficial as
they are thought to help boost the
level of immunity and lower blood
pressure.
CHAPTER 4- THE
FUNDAMENTALS OF
THE PALEO DIET
Significant advancements have been
made since the Stone Age. When we
take a closer look, we will realize that
the only progress we have really made
is related to Ɵme and the
development of numerous programs
and tools which make daily tasks
much easier to get done.
As you may be aware, advances in
appliances are not all that progressive
as it is merely a more passive way to
get things done and does have its
drawbacks as we are more prone to
diseases.
The quesƟon is where exactly we are
geƫng it wrong. Why is it that our
generaƟon is so afflicted with health
issues, a shorter lifespan and obesity?
Let us not forget the increase in
geneƟc aberraƟons and disorders that
occur as a result of birth defects.
The Variation in Styles of Eating
Do you remember hearing you are
what you eat from your mother?
Were you ever in agreement with that
statement? Take a moment to look at
the difference in the way we eat now
and how our ancestors used to eat.
I can just imagine that if some persons
from the Paleolithic period happened
to be around they would not even
consider what we eat to be edible.
Approximately ninety percent of the
diet is preserved, refined, readymade
food. A great porƟon of our current
diet did not exist in that era and
historical records show that they were
much healthier without all the
modern “conveniences” that we have
today.
Plan Points for Paleo Food
The thought of adapƟng to the Paleo
style of living or using the Paleo meal
plan was introduced by Loren
Cordian.
The basis on which the Paleo diet was
founded is that the anatomical design
of the human body is best suited for a
diet that was used in the Stone Age as
opposed to the one we currently
have.
The body is actually programmed to
work best with the food that was
eaten in Paleolithic times.
There would not have been livestock
rearing or any form of agriculture
during that Ɵme and the diet was
wholly based on fresh vegetables and
fruits as well as marine and wildlife.
The only method of cooking in the
Paleolithic Era was roasƟng. As such
frying and other methods were not
even invented yet.
There was liƩle consumpƟon of
grains, dried beans, oils, sugar and
sodium in that time period.
The diet was very high in protein and
had fewer carbohydrates. It also
included no cereals, dried beans or
additives.
The Paleo Food Plan- EssenƟal
Ingredients
Wildlife (bison deer etc.), chicken,
pork and meat (steak)
Eggs
Fish
Dry fruits
Honey
Variety of fruits
Oils (natural)
Mushrooms (organic)
Greens
Walnuts
Essential facts about the Paleo Diet
Weight reducƟon is possible through
the consumpƟon of food low in
carbohydrate and high in protein.
A lot of the illnesses we have today
such as osteoarthriƟs, high blood
pressure and heart problems are less
with the Paleo diet.
There is no need to stress oneself out
by working out how many calories to
consume.
A lot of the specialists state that the
Paleo diet is a bit restricƟve. That may
be so but we must bear in mind that
the cavemen were sƟll able to get by
with than restricƟon and thrive much
beƩer than we are now. It really can’t
hurt to have a liƩle restricƟon in our
overall diet.
CHAPTER 5- THE
SEVEN KEYS OF THE
PALEO DIET
Dr. Loren Cordian has actually
outlined seven keys in the Paleo diet
which he created. His work is based
on the thorough analysis of the daily
eaƟng habits of the hunter/gatherer
socieƟes. AŌer conducƟng a number
of analyses on the elements of the
diet in varying amounts, he came to
the realizaƟon that there were seven
common aƩributes for each. They are
outlined below.
Consuming fewer carbohydrates than
the amount recommended in the
modern western diet. The
carbohydrates that are consumed
should be from vegetables and fruits
and not refined sugars, starchy tubers
or grains.
Consuming more animal protein that
the western diet allowsapproximately fiŌy five percent of the
calories gained from the Paleo diet
are from lean animal protein.
Geƫng the large amount of fiber
required from vegetables and nonstarchy fruits.
Consuming a diet that has a net
alkaline load- when the body has high
acidic content the body will have
issues on a cellular level and person
with this problem tend to suffer from
faƟgue. All vegetables, fruits and sea
greens are alkaline forming. Meat
though tends to be acid forming so to
have the right net alkaline load the
right amounts of each has to be
consumed.
Foods with high potassium content
and low sodium content are to be
consumed. HydraƟon can be
maintained through the consumpƟon
of potassium. When the body is
properly hydrated it will promote
nerve impulse sƟmulaƟon, muscle
contracƟon and opƟmal heart
funcƟon. Foods that contain
potassium include most fruits like
kiwis, bananas, and leafy green
vegetables. High levels of sodium
promote dehydraƟon which is not
good.
Consume a reasonable amount of
polyunsaturated and
monounsaturated fats. The same
porƟons of Omega 6 and Omega 3 fats
should be consumed and the amount
of saturated fat consumed should be
reduced. Great food opƟons for this
include avocado, olives and cold
water fish.
Foods rich in minerals, vitamins,
anƟoxidants and plane
phytochemicals are ideal for
consumption. Phytochemicals are also
referred to as phytonutrients and are
plant components that enhance the
immune system and offer other
health benefits in addiƟon to its
nutriƟonal value. Great sources of
phytochemicals include green tea,
seeds, nuts, vegetables and fruits.
If you have made the decision to
follow the Paleo diet, you will have to
make use of the seven keys to have
the best success. Buying a Paleo
cookbook will help you to make great
recipes but won’t help you to be more
aware of why it is best to eat in this
way. As always educaƟon and
knowledge is power. When one
understands the seven keys in the
Paleo diet you will make beƩer
decision with what you consume.
CHAPTER 6- LOSING
WEIGHT THE PALEO
DIET WAY
The Paleo diet facilitates the shedding
of excess weight as it restores the
ideal condiƟons for meal
consumpƟon that the human body
was made for. A lot of persons are
able to do this quite easily. They
successfully get rid of whole grains in
their diet and the weight just seems
to “melt away” much more quickly
than they can get new clothes.
On the other hand there are some
persons that have difficulty geƫng
this done or may see some progress
and then not see anything else
happen aŌer a while. Needless to say
that it can be rather discouraging to
be making all the effort with liƩle to
no success. It does not maƩer
whether you have just started and
already frustrated or have reached
your peak aŌer having relaƟve
success, there sƟll exist ways in which
you can manipulate the Paleo diet to
achieve sustainable and healthy
weight loss.
Are CounƟng Carbohydrates or
Calories?
This diet is in no way based on the
counƟng calories as a means to losing
weight. The theory of the Paleo diet is
not based on making the disƟncƟon
between calories that are harmful as
opposed to calories that are
nourishing. The point is that you will
lose weight if you eat only twelve
hundred calories of Doritos on a daily
basis but the downside is that you will
have certain nutriƟonal deficiencies
and have digesƟve problems that will
do much more harm in the long run.
To add to that, the weight that you
lose will be regained quite quicklywith the lack of foods that are
processed industrially, the over
sƟmulaƟon of food reward centers
and an inflamed digesƟve system your
body will have a natural seƫng for fat
that it will strive to maintain give or
take a few pounds. This is referred to
as homeostasis. If you are able to
adhere to the restricƟon of calories
long enough to lose a parƟcular
amount of weight the metabolic rate
will decrease to cut back on the level
of energy thus cuƫng back on the
number of calories burned to
maintain the basic funcƟons of the
body.
As a result you will be hungry all the
Ɵme and the body will resort to
geƫng energy from whatever you
consume. On the other hand if you
eat too much the opposite will occur.
The body has a set weight that it
wants to maintain and can do so
through certain processes.
A man known as Paul Jaminet has a
hypothesis that the body places even
more importance on the maintenance
of lean tissue health. According to him
lean Ɵssue makes use of the nervous
system as opposed to using a
hormone like lepƟn to send signals to
the brain. This makes it even harder
for scientists to measure.
The whole point is that if the body is
not geƫng all the nutrients that it
needs it will get it elsewhere using the
same methods that it would use when
the level of fat is low-it will trigger an
increase in appeƟte and get all the
energy from food consumed. As the
bodies aim is to maintain lean Ɵssues
mass and weight, a diet low in calories
which does not have the necessary
nutrients will start a “fight” between
two biological seƫngs. This is a baƩle
that many lose.
Fortunately, it is a baƩle that can be
avoided. Yes it may be true the main
requirement of weight loss is some
deficit in energy which requires more
calories to be burned versus what is
consumed. The main problem with
this is that the consumpƟon of
calories really does not maƩer. It is
not the best way to create that deficit
as it does not take into account the
ways in which various foods are
processed. ScienƟsts tend to test the
caloric content if food through the use
of bomb calorimeters which is not
similar to the process involved in
human digestion.
A pop tart and a steak might have the
same number of calories but that is
where the similarity ends. It makes
the focus on the quality of food and
nutrients much easier and is a more
effective way to get the deficit need to
promote weight loss.
T h e three macronutrients required
are fat, carbohydrates and protein
and though they are all important,
excess carbohydrates poses a problem
for obesity as it is closely linked to the
consumpƟon of processed food items
that are low in nutrients. A diet that is
based on large amounts of
carbohydrates (refined) will promote
weight gain as it affects the balance of
two important hormones, lepƟn and
insulin.
The role that insulin plays in the
metabolism is to convert the
carbohydrates to glycogen which is
then stored in the muscles as fuel that
can be used later on. Through the
consistent increase in the
consumpƟon of carbohydrates the
body will develop a resistance to
insulin. The muscles will be filled to
capacity with glycogen and begin to
resist the insulin.
As a result more insulin will be
produced by the pancreas and the
muscles will just resists even more.
Having glucose in the bloodstream is
potenƟally toxic and as there is
nowhere else for it to be stored it will
be stored as fat.
The resistance to insulin caused by a
diet high in carbohydrates will also
cause an imbalance in another
important hormone known as lepƟn
which is responsible for regulaƟon the
homeostaƟc process. LepƟn is a made
by body fat so the more fat you have
the higher the levels of lepƟn and this
triggers weight loss and the less fat
you have the opposite occurs.
The inflammaƟon that occurs with
insulin resistance disrupts the natural
balance by triggering lepƟn resistance.
In this case the level of fat triggers an
increase in the producƟon of lepƟn
and the brain is not sent any
messages. To make the situaƟon
worse, a diet based on processed
foods will trigger a decrease in the
sensiƟvity of the brain to lepƟn,
causing an increase in ones appeƟte
and as such the intake of nutrients.
As the brain is not receiving any
signals to stop this increase in
consumpƟon, you will conƟnue to
eat. The body will make more lepƟn
to make the signal stronger. The only
thing is that the only way to do this is
for the level of fat to increase in the
body. As such the natural seƫng for
weight will increase as more fat will
be required by the body to lower the
levels of lepƟn, increase the
metabolism to send the signal to the
brain while decreasing the appetite.
This enƟre situaƟon is compounded
by oversƟmulaƟon caused by the
consumpƟon of industrially processed
foods. The higher levels of lepƟn cut
down on the food reward to trigger
weight loss. LepƟn resistance causes
the opposite effect. The toxins
consumed (high fructose corn syrup,
seed oils and gluten) which cause
inflammaƟon also adds to lepƟn
resistance. You will also develop other
problems with your metabolism which
can lead to chronic illnesses like
diabetes.
A basic version of the Paleo diet can
always be modified for the purposes
of weight loss in the same way that it
can be adjusted for diabetes, GERD or
IBS among other medical issues.
Before this process of
experimentaƟon begins ensure that
the fundamentals are set. If you are
an individual that cheats, it might be
best to commit to an opƟon that will
help you get rid of some of your not
so good eaƟng habits. The great thing
is that if you are following a strict
Paleo diet and are not making any
progress you can make tweaks to the
diet to suit your particular situation.
CHAPTER 7- WHY
PROTEIN HELPS BURN
CALORIES
Protein is one of the most commonly
used words and tends to be
misunderstood. The quesƟons can
then be posed as to how much
protein is required? Some persons
also wonder whether or not protein
will bulk them up too much? The main
thing to note is that protein plays an
important role in life. Apart from
water protein is the most abundant
substance. In fact approximately fiŌy
percent of the body’s dry weight is
made up of protein. This includes the
nails, eyes, hair, skin and muscle.
I think the general message has been
conveyed here. Below are three
reasons why protein helps burn
calories and in turn promote weight
loss.
Protein Helps Satiate Ones Appetite
Of the three food groups (fats,
carbohydrates and proteins) protein is
the most effecƟve at curbing hunger.
The ability of the protein to saƟsfy
hunger also has an effect on the
amount that you consume on a daily
basis. If you typically start the day off
with some high quality protein
(instead of breakfast cereals) you will
be more likely to have more
consistent levels of hunger daily.
Protein Cuts Down On Insulin
Sensitivity
Being able to control the levels in
insulin in the body will have a huge
impact on your waistline and the
weight you are at. This is because the
consumpƟon of bad carbohydrates
like cakes, sweets and pasta can have
an effect on the producƟon of insulin
by quickly increasing the levels of
bolls sugar which will trigger an
increase in insulin production.
This leads to the body storing more
fat. If you check it out most over
weight persons tend to be insulin
resistant. This really means that the
pancreas is working overƟme to
produce insulin to reduce the levels of
sugar in the blood to what it was prior
to you eaƟng. This will just make you
want to eat more and this is where
the vicious cycle of overeating starts.
In a nutshell the consumpƟon of high
quality protein will help cut down on
this occurring and allow the body to
do the same job with less insulin.
Protein helps burn calories
Most people are aware that there are
two ways in which you can burn
calories. It is either to eat less or
become more acƟve. There is however
another way to burn off these calories
and it is known as the thermic effect
of food. It is referring to the amount
of energy that the body has to break
down food and get the necessary
energy from it.
The great thing is that the body
requires two point five to three Ɵmes
more energy to break down proteins
as opposed to fats or carbohydrates.
This will increase the metabolic rate.
Now that is fabulous! A way does
exist to increase ones metabolism
without geƫng off the cushion. Of
course it is not ideal to eat snacks
while watching television as a means
to lose weight.
If weight loss is really your goal you
ought to ensure that you are
consuming protein like eggs, lean
meats or fresh meats. Though a
combinaƟon of grains and pulses are
good sources of protein as well as
soya and dairy but it is not
recommended. If it is a maƩer of
convenience you can get your protein
by having a shake that is low in sugar.
So the general guide is to base each
meal and snack around protein and
then add some fresh vegetables and
fruits and some quality fats as well.
CHAPTER 8- TOP
PALEO DIET RECIPES
There is nothing tasƟer than having a
jar of beets on hand to garnish your
favorite barbeque dish. The thing is
that store bought marinated beets
has a high sugar content as also
contain preservaƟves that do not
make it an ideal Paleo food.
The drawback that many people
create is that making jarred
vegetables at home is too complicated
and takes up a lot of Ɵme. This is not
necessarily the case. I have a recipe
that is preƩy easy to follow and does
not require a lot of Ɵme. the beets
will be ready for eaƟng aŌer only a
day of marinaƟng as opposed to
recipes that require the marinaƟng
process to be for as long as three
weeks.
Marinated Beets Recipe
Produces two quarts
Ingredients
1 tbsp melted Paleo cooking fat
3 lbs beets
A couple sprigs of fresh savory and/or
thyme
2 sliced onions (thin rounds)
1 cup white wine vinegar
½ tsp salt
6 whole cloves
¼ tsp black peppercorns
2 large strips lemon zest
6 whole all spice berries
2 one quart jars
2 twigs fresh dill
Preparation
Preheat the oven to four hundred
degrees Fahrenheit
Whilst the oven is heaƟng, scrub the
beets to get rid of excess dirt and
remove the root tip and stems.
Get a big baking dish and line it with
enough foil to swathe the base and fold
over the beets when they are placed in
it. The beets should then be put in the
dish and a bit of cooking fat drizzled on
them. Add the savory and/or thyme.
Cover the beats with the foil, place in
the oven and roast unƟl tender (sixty
to ninety minutes).
When that is complete take the beets
out of the oven and let it to cool a bit.
Ensure they are sƟll warm so that the
skin can be removed with ease. When
the skin is removed it they can be
allowed to cool some more.
Put the onions you have sliced in a
bowl and pour in enough boiling water
to cover it. Let it sit for approximately
ten minutes. They will become tender
and start the marinating process.
The cooled beets can then be sliced
into quarter inch rounds. You can start
to layer the beets and onion in the jars.
The lemon zest, all spice berries,
cloves, peppercorns and salt can be
mixed together in a small bowl. A half
of the mixture must then be put in
every jar.
The jars can then be sealed and placed
in the refrigerator for a day.
Mussels in White Wine Sauce Recipe
Makes 4 servings
Ingredients
3 tbsp Paleo cooking fat
1 ¼ cups dry white wine
¼ cup minced onions or shallots or
onions
2 lbs cleaned fresh mussels
3 stems fresh thyme
4 stems fresh parsley
Pepper and sea salt to taste
1 bay leaf (small)
¼ cup fresh chopped parsley
Zest of 1 lemon
Preparation
Before starƟng this recipe ensure that
you clean the mussels properly and
discard the dead ones.
Use a big skillet and melt the cooking
fat over medium heat –sauté the

CHAPTER 9- PALEO
EXERCISES
The Stone Age/Paleolithic period
precedes all current advancements in
technology. This includes mass food
producƟon and farming. During this
period man was a gatherer and
hunter that consumed what he could
catch or scavenge. The Paleo diet of
today is based on food that is grown
naturally and not the product of
processing or farming.
Though the Stone Age man did not
exercise much he had a very acƟve life
style and spent a lot of his Ɵme doing
labor to gather food. Advocates of
this kind of exercise think that these
parƟcular types of exercise and is
much beƩer suited to improve the
levels of fitness than the modern
forms of exercise.
Squats
Before chairs were invented, Stone
Age man would squat to rest.
Squaƫng is an effecƟve way to keep
the knees and hips mobile as well as
being a great leg exercise that helps
improve jumping and running. The
best way to do squats a s a form of
condiƟoning is to stand with feet
apart (shoulder width) and have your
hands at your sides. Bend the knees
while pushing the hips back and squat
unƟl the thighs are basically parallel
to the floor. Ensure you are pressing
down through the heels and stand up.
To improve mobility in the knees and
hip one simply has to squat and rest
on your haunches while resƟng ones
heel son the floor. This can be difficult
for those persons that are chair
bound on a daily basis as the lower
muscles in the body tend to be Ɵght.
To improve on one’s ability to get this
done one can use a door handle that
is wait high to provide some balance.
Hold the posiƟon for as long as
possible as the level of flexibility
increases.
Sprinting
Stone Age man has to be able to
sprint to get away from predators and
also to hunt game. This is a great way
to exercise as it helps improve
cardiovascular fitness and build up
the strength of the legs. Start off slow
and don’t try to sprint full out from
the get go. Also sprint for varying
distances taking enough Ɵme to rest
between sprints.
Dragging
When our ancestors caught and killed
their prey, they had to get it back
home somehow and this was done by
dragging. It is a great way to work out.
Dragging objects backward helps to
strengthen the arms, lower back and
thighs while dragging forward works
on the abs, glutes and hamstrings.
You can use a weighted sled or even a
Ɵre with a rope aƩached. As long as
the weight is varied and also the
distance covered and the direcƟon
you are going it will work rather
effectively.
Throwing
Our ancestors’ main weapons were
spears and rocks which they had to be
able to throw great distances. To
replicate this go outdoors and throw a
rock in a number of ways. You can
throw it back over your head and
forward using one arm at a Ɵme. Run
for the rock wherever it has landed
and repeat the process of course a
medicine ball will be just as effecƟve
especially if you are not able to get it
done outdoors. AnyƟme you perform
any acƟviƟes that involve throwing
ensure that the abdominal muscles
are kept tight and the spine is stable.
