Bar Code
Bar Code
Bar codes ( also called Universal Product Codes or UPC ’ s ) are small , coded labels that contain information about the item they are attached to ; the information is contained in a numerical code , usually containing 12 digits . UPC ’ s are easily scanned by laser beams . UPC ’ s are used on many things , including most items for sale in stores , library books , inventory items , many packages and pieces of luggage being shipped , railroad cars , etc . The UPC may contain coded information about the item , its manufacturer , place of origin , destination , the owner , or other data . The first “ bullseye code ” was invented by Norman Joseph Woodland and Bernard Silver , from work which they began in 1948 . On October 20 , 1949 , they patented their bullseye code ( a series of concentric circles that were scannable from all directions , using regular light )  . Woodland and Silver patented a new UPC in October 1952 ; the UPC was also improved and adapted by David J . Collins in the late 1950 ’ s ( to track railroad cars )  . UPC ’ s were first used in grocery stores in the early 1970 ’ s . 

Bread Slicer
Bread Slicer
The automatic commercial bread slicer was invented in 1927 by Otto Frederick Rohwedder from Iowa , USA ( Rohwedder had worked on his machine since 1912 )  . His machine both sliced and wrapped a loaf of bread . In 1928 , the bread slicer was improved by Gustav Papendick , a baker from St . Louis , Missouri . 

Bubble Gum
Bubble Gum
Bubblegum was invented by Frank Henry Fleer in 1906 , but was not successful ; the formulation of Fleer ’ s “ Blibber-Blubber ,  ” was too sticky . In 1928 , Walter E . Diemer invented a superior formulation for bubble gum , which he called ” Double Bubble .  ” 

Burbank , Luther
Burbank , Luther
Luther Burbank ( 1849-1926 ) was an American plant breeder who developed over 800 new strains of plants , including many popular varieties of potato , plums , prunes , berries , trees , and flowers . One of his greatest inventions was the Russet Burbank potato ( also called the Idaho potato )  , which he developed in 1871 . This blight-resistant potato helped Ireland recover from its devastating potato famine of 1840-60 . Burbank also developed the Flaming Gold nectarine , the Santa Rosa plum , and the Shasta daisy . Burbank was raised on a farm and only went to elementary school ; he was self-educated . Burbank applied the works of Charles Darwin to plants . Of Darwin ’ s The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication , Burbank said ,  “ It opened up a new world to me .  ” 

Can and Can Opener
Can and Can Opener
A metal can ( or canister ) for preserving food was invented in 1810 by a Peter Durand , of London , England . Metal cans ( also called tins ) could preserve food for a long period of time . To open a can , a person had to use a hammer and chisel ; the can opener wasn ’ t invented for another 50 years . 

The can opener was invented in 1858 by Ezra Warner of Waterbury , Connecticut , USA . Warner ’ s device used a lever and chisel . Until then , cans were opened using a hammer and chisel ; the can opener was invented 50 years after the metal can was invented . 

The can opener was improved in 1870 by William Lyman of West Meridian , Connecticut , USA . Lyman ’ s device used a rotating wheel and a sharp edge . His can opener only fit one size of can , and first had to pierce the center of the can . 

The modern-day type of can opener ( using a serrated wheel ) was invented in 1925 . 

Carbonated Water
Carbonated Water
People have been drinking naturally-carbonated water ( water with carbon dioxide bubbles ) since pre-historic times . The English chemist Joseph Priestley experimented with putting gases in liquids in 1767 , producing the first artificially-produced carbonated water . 

In 1770 , the Swedish chemist Torbern Bergman invented a device for making carbonated water from chalk and sulfuric acid . 

Carver , George Washington
Carver , George Washington
PeanutGeorge Washington Carver ( 1865 ? -1943 ) was an American scientist , educator , humanitarian , and former slave . Carver developed hundreds of products from peanuts , sweet potatoes , pecans , and soybeans ; his discoveries greatly improved the agricultural output and the health of Southern farmers . Before this , the only main crop in the South was cotton . The products that Carver invented included a rubber substitute , adhesives , foodstuffs , dyes , pigments , and many other products .

Chocolate Chips
Chocolate Chips
Ruth Wakefield invented chocolate chips ( and chocolate chip cookies ) in 1930 . Wakefield ran the Toll House Inn in Whitman , Massachusetts . Her new cookie invention was called the “ Toll House Cookie .  ” Her original cookies used broken-up bars of semi-sweet chocolate . 

Coca-Cola
Coca-Cola
Dr . John Stith Pemberton ( 1830-1888 ) was an American pharmacist , soldier , and inventor . He invented Coca-Cola on May 8th , 1886 in Atlanta , Georgia , USA . He had invented many syrups , medicines , and elixirs before , including a very popular drink called French Wine of Coca , which contained French Bordeaux wine , coca leaves , and caffeine ( from the kola nut )  . 

When Atlanta banned alcohol consumption in 1885 , Pemberton had to change the formula of his French Wine of Coca , omitting the French wine . He added sugar , citric acid and essential oils of many fruits to the drink , and the original Coca-Cola was created . It was named for its main ingredients , coca leaves and the kola nut . Coca-Cola quickly became a very popular soda fountain drink . 

Pemberton became partners with Frank Robinson and David Roe , but the partners soon began to quarrel and Pemberton soon sold his interest in Coca-Cola . The formula for Coca-Cola is a closely-guarded secret . 

Cotton Candy
Cotton Candy
Cotton candy is a soft confection made from sugar that is heated and spun into slim threads that look like a mass of cotton . It was invented in 1897 by William Morrison and John C . Wharton , candymakers from Nashville , Tennessee . 

Crum , George
The potato chip was invented in 1853 by George Crum . Crum was a Native American / African American chef at the Moon Lake Lodge resort in Saratoga Springs , New York , USA . French fries were popular at the restaurant and one day a diner complained that the fries were too thick . Although Crum made a thinner batch , the customer was still unsatisfied . Crum finally made fries that were too thin to eat with a fork , hoping to annoy the extremely fussy customer . The customer , surprisingly enough , was happy - and potato chips were invented !

Dutch Chocolate
Coenraad Johannes Van Houten ( 1801-1887 ) was a Dutch chemist and chocolate manufacturer who in 1828 invented the process that is used to turn roasted cacao beans ( the source of chocolate ) into cocoa powder ( this process is now called Dutching , Dutch processing or alkalinisation )  . His method was an inexpensive way of removing much of the cocoa butter from the nib ( center ) of the beans , using a hydraulic press , and adding alkaline salts ( potassium carbonate or sodium carbonate ) so that the cocoa powder would mix readily with water or milk ( the alkali neutralized the acidic chocolate )  . The resulting cocoa powder can be used to make chocolate milk and other delicacies . 

Epperson , Frank
Epperson , Frank
The popsicle was invented by 11-year-old Frank Epperson in 1905 . Epperson ( 1894- ?  ) lived in San Francisco , California . Epperson had left a fruit drink out overnight ( with a stirrer in it )  , and it froze , making a new treat . His frozen treat was originally called the Epsicle . Epperson got a patent on his “ frozen ice on a stick ” many years later , in 1923 . The Epsicle was later renamed the popsicle . Epperson also invented the twin popsicle ( with two sticks so it could be shared by two children )  , Fudgsicle , Creamsicle and Dreamsicle . 

Hot Dogs
Hot Dogs
Hot dogs began as sausages sold in buns . They were first sold from carts by German immigrants on the streets of New York City in the 1860s . The bun replaced a plate and made the hot dog easier to carry and eat . Sauerkraut was provided as a relish on the hot dog . 

Kool Aid
The powdered drink Kool-Aid was invented in 1927 by the chemist Edwin Perkins of Nebraska Omaha . Perkins started a company in 1914 that sold perfume and calling cards ; it was called the Perkins Products Company . Originally located in Hendley , Nebraska , they moved to Hastings , Nebraska ( about 90 miles west of Lincoln ) in 1920 , and expanded their product line to include spices , medicines , more toilet preparations , and other household items . 

Kool-Aid was originally a liquid called “ Fruit Smack ,  ” and was sold in a 4-ounce bottles . It was later renamed Kool-Ade ( and later , Kool-Aid )  , and sold in powdered form in packets . The seven original Kool-Aid flavors were : Cherry , Lemon-Lime , Grape , Orange , Root Beer , Strawberry , and Raspberry . The Kool-Aid factory later moved to Chicago , Illinois , and was bought by General Foods Corporation in 1953 . 

Life Savers
The candy called “ Life Savers ” was invented in 1912 by Clarence Crane , a chocolate maker from Cleveland , Ohio . His original Life Saver was a life-preserver-shaped peppermint candy called “ Pep-O-Mint .  ” Crane designed it as a summer candy - one that would not melt in the summer heat . He bought a pill-making machine to make the candies , and then punched a hole in the middle . Since they looked like little life preservers , he called them Life Savers . In 1913 , he sold the rights to his candy to Edward Noble for only $2 , 900 . Noble then sold Life Savers in many flavors , including the original peppermint . There are now 24 flavors ; they are manufactured in Holland , Michigan . 

Marshmallow
Marshmallow candy was first made by ancient Egyptians over three thousand years ago . The Egyptians made candy from the root of the marshmallow plant ( Althea officinalis )  , a plant that grows in marshes . Today ’ s marshmallows do not contain any mallow root - gelatin is substituted for the sweet , sticky root . 

Mayonnaise
Mayonnaise was invented in France hundreds of years ago , probably in 1756 by the French chef working for the Duke de Richelieu , The first ready-made mayonnaise was sold in the US in 1905 at Richard Hellman ’ s deli in New York . Hellman sold his wife ’ s mayonnaise in open wooden boats . In 1912 , he sold the mayonnaise in large glass bottles ; the type he called “ Hellman ’ s Blue Ribbon Mayonnaise ” was very popular and is still sold today ( it is now owned by Best Foods )  . 

Mechanical Reaper
Mechanical Reaper
Cyrus Hall McCormick ( February 15 , 1809 - May 13 , 1884 ) was an American inventor ( of Irish descent ) who developed the mechanical reaper . His new machine combined many of the steps involved in harvesting crops , greatly increased crop yields , decreased the number of field hands needed for the harvest , lowered costs , and revolutionized farming . 

Microwave Oven
Microwave Oven
The microwave oven was invented as an accidental by-product of war-time ( World War 2 ) radar research using magnetrons ( vacuum tubes that produce microwave radiation )  . In 1946 , the engineer Dr . Percy LeBaron Spencer , who worked for the Raytheon Corporation , was working on magnetrons . One day at work , he had a candy bar in his pocket , and found that it had melted . He realized that the microwaves he was working with had caused it to melt . After experimenting , he realized that microwaves would cook foods quickly - even faster than conventional ovens that cook with heat . The Raytheon Corporation produced the first commercial microwave oven in 1954 ; it was called the 1161 Radarange . 

Pasteur , Louis
Louis Pasteur ( 1822-1895 ) was a French chemist and inventor . Pasteur studied the process of fermentation , and postulated that fermentation was produced by microscopic organisms ( other than yeast )  , which Pasteur called germs . He hypothesized that these germs might be responsible for some diseases . Pasteur disproved the notion of “ spontaneous generation ” which stated that organisms could spring from nothing ; Pasteur showed that organisms came form other , pre-existing organisms . Applying his theories to foods and drinks , Pasteur invented a heating process ( now called pasteurization ) which sterilizes food , killing micro-organisms that contaminate it .

Refrigerator
Refrigerator
The first method of refrigeration ( cooling air by the evaporation of liquids in a vacuum ) was invented in 1748 by William Cullen of the University of Glasgow , Scotland ; Cullen did not apply his discovery to any practical purposes . Michael Farady , an English physicist liquefied ammonia to cause cooling ( in the 1800 ’ s )  . Faraday ’ s idea would eventually lead to the development of compressors , which compress gas to liquid form . The American inventor Oliver Evans designed the first refrigeration machine in 1805 . In 1844 , John Gorrie , an American doctor from Florida made a device based on Evans ’ invention that would make ice in order to cool the air for yellow fever patients . 

The first electric refrigerator was invented in 1803 by Thomas Moore . The first commercial refrigerator designed to keep food cold was sold in 1911 ( by the General Electric Company ) and in 1913 ( invented by Fred W . Wolf of Fort Wayne , Indiana , USA )  ; these model consisted of a unit that was mounted on top of an ice box . A self-contained refrigerator ( with a compressor on the bottom of the cabinet ) was invented by Alfred Mellowes in 1915 . Mellowes produced this refrigerator commercially ( each unit was hand made )  , but was bought out by W . C . Durant ( the president of General Motors ) in 1918 , who started the Frigidaire Company in order to mass-produce refrigerators in the USA . 

Rillieux , Norbert
Rillieux , Norbert
Norbert Rillieux ( March 17 , 1806-October 8 , 1894 ) was an African-American inventor and engineer who invented a device that revolutionized sugar processing . Rillieux ’ s multiple effect vacuum sugar evaporator ( patented in 1864 ) made the processing of sugar more efficient , faster , and much safer . The resulting sugar was also superior . His apparatus was eventually adopted by sugar processing plants all around the world . 

Sandwich
Sandwich
The sandwich was invented by John Montagu , the 4th Earl of Sandwich ( 1718-1792 )  . About 1762 , he is reputed to have been too busy to have a formal meal , and instructed his cook to pack his meat inside the bread to save him time - and the sandwich was invented . 

Teabag
Tea bags were invented by Thomas Sullivan around 1908 . The first bags were made from silk . Sullivan was a tea and coffee merchant in New York who began packaging tea sample in tiny silk bags , but many customers brewed the tea in them ( the tea-filled bag was placed directly into the boiling water where the tea brewed , instead of the traditional way of brewing loose tea in a teapot )  . Later tea bags were made of thin paper . 

Universal Product Code
