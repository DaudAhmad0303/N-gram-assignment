ABSTRACT
During five seasons of excavations directed by 
Leslie Alcock from 1966 to 1970 on the multiperiod 
hillfort at South Cadbury Castle proven and possible 
Early Neolithic postholes and pits were identified in 
several trenches on the plateau, under the southern 
inner bank, and bisected by the Iron Age South 
West gate passage. A discrete assemblage of Late 
Neolithic material was discovered under the north 
bank. The evidence has been treated only cursorily 
in a popular account of the excavations and in the 
final reports which focused on the periods following 
1000 BC (Alcock 1972, 1995; Barrett et al. 2000). 
Subsequent excavations from 1995 to 1999 by the 
South Cadbury Environs Project on a spur outside 
the western ramparts exposed an Early Neolithic 
occupation hollow and four contemporary pits. 
There were notable differences in the pottery, bone 
and worked stone assemblages between the hilltop 
and on the spur. 
This paper presents fully for the first time the 
evidence from the two South Cadbury sites. It 
considers their place in the Early Neolithic with 
respect to the better known sites of the period in 
Wessex and the south west peninsula. The welldated palimpsest from Milsoms Corner is an 
important contribution to our understanding of 
day-to-day life at a temporary occupation site and 
to the topical debate concerning deposit formation 
in Neolithic pits.
INTRODUCTION
From 1966–70 the excavations on the multiperiod 
hillfort sheltering from the west of the Somerset 
village of South Cadbury in south-west England 
(Fig. 1A and B, 1; Fig. 2A) were a centre of 
international media attention which reached 
beyond the confines of an archaeological audience. 
A speculative association with ‘Arthur’ was given 
tenuous substance with the discovery of Post Roman 
defences and a hall (Alcock 1995). A remarkable 
sequence of occupation over the 1st millennium BC 
through to the 1st century AD excited much interest 
for students of the Late Bronze Age and Iron Age 
but this abated with deferral of publication for three 
decades during which research into hillforts was 
dominated by Danebury, Hampshire. When the 
Cadbury report finally appeared presentation of 
data concerning the Early and Late Neolithic was 
confined largely to its situation as the precursor of 
the later sequence of defences (Barrett et al. 2000, 
53-4 and 86-8). Summary descriptive accounts 
of the Neolithic phases had appeared in Alcock’s 
annual summaries and in a popular account of his 
investigations (Alcock 1968; 1969; 1970; 1971; 
1972) but they have not received the academic 
attention they deserve.
Twenty-five years after the close of Alcock’s 
programme five seasons of excavation began 
at Milsoms Corner, a low spur projecting from 
the hillfort’s lower western slope (Figs. 2A). In a 
trench with maximum dimensions of 30m by 21m a 
remarkable prehistoric sequence was sealed beneath 
sterile colluvium which had formed during the later 
Iron Age. Earlier Iron Age and Late Bronze Age 
deposits sealed a Middle Bronze Age ditch which 
had cut a Beaker burial pit. The cutting of the pit 
represented an episode during the formation of a 
soil which covered the site and sealed a group of 
Early Neolithic features, arising from a probably 
single brief phase of occupation (Figs. 2B). The 
discovery, and in particular a study of the entire 
South Cadbury bone assemblage (Randall 2010), 
has prompted a review of the evidence from the 
hilltop.

The return to the South Cadbury archive (SCCA) 
has been an iterative process. In the first place 
finds from well established Neolithic contexts were 
recorded in full for the first time. There followed a 
trawl through the written and drawn records from 
all sites (trenches). It was noted that a significant 
number of features from which finds had not been 
described or were lacking had been assigned a 
Neolithic date in site notebooks and context sheets 
based on fills coloured varying shades of red. The 
distinction was less clear cut away from the plateau 
but it was sufficient to generate a more extensive 
list of possible Neolithic features. The finds from 
these features were also recorded where present.
The Early Neolithic features on the hilltop 
should probably be regarded as the residues of 
several occupation episodes, possibly discrete both 
in time and space. Two radiocarbon assays from a 
single feature offer the only absolute chronological 
references and their dates proved to be of a broad 
span and probably derived from material related 
to different episodes. At Milsoms Corner six dates 
derived from three features are sufficiently close to 
imply a single episode of occupation or, at the very 
least, the return of a particular group of people to 
the same place over the span of just a few years.
Features on South Cadbury hilltop were cut into 
Upper Inferior Oolite which capped the Yeovil Sand 
into which off summit features were cut, including 
those in sites A and D. Milsoms Corner spur 
was also made up of Yeovil Sand although early 
colluviation had caused a mixed natural surface. 
The figures below relating to individual features 
from the two sites include generous selections of 
their finds.
THE MILSOMS CORNER OCCUPATION
The Early Neolithic pits had significantly different 
characteristics from each other with respect to 
shape, size, fills and finds. On the other hand, 
the lack of weathering of their sides suggests that 
each had been cut then infilled over a period of no 
more than a few months. One pit had cut through 
an early soil horizon but the other feature had been 
cut directly into natural of slightly reddish yellow 
sandy clay in an area with maximum extents of 
15m by 17m in the north-eastern part of the site 
(Fig. 2B). They were sealed by red sandy clay soil 
(1065) which formed over a long period during 
which a Beaker burial pit was cut. Consequently, 
there is no evidence to suggest that the pits and 
much of the occupation hollow had been truncated, 
in contrast to features of the period in many other 
parts of central and southern Britain (Loveday with 
Beamish 2012, 100). The fills and finds from the 
floor area and each pit are summarized in Table 1.
Floor 1469/1779 and its associated features
On the north lip of the spur a well-defined hollow or 
terrace into natural, 551, was exposed over an area 
of 3.5m by 2.5m midway along the north baulk of the 
trench (Fig. 3A). The longer measurement was from 
west to east, following that of the spur. Towards the 
western end it had been truncated by ploughing but 
over 2m of its central and western areas reached a 
depth of 0.15m. The full extent of the east end was 
not exposed nor was the area under the baulk. A pit, 
293, which appears to have been cut into a fairly 
central area within the hollow also continued under 
the trench’s northern baulk, suggesting that it may 
have been located on the long axis. The exposed 
outline of the hollow suggests that the feature was 
broadly rectangular or square with a putative full 
extent of approximately 4.7m by 5m.
The red fill (1097/1731) of the hollow was 
indistinguishable from soil (1065) which sealed the 
other Early Neolithic features. It had accumulated 
gradually over a floor (1469/1779) and the fills of 
features cut into it, including pit 293. The floor 
was between 0.03 and 0.06m higher in the area 
surrounding the pit. A very thin layer of ashy 
charcoal (1736) was distributed over a slight 
depression between the pit and the southern edge 
of the hollow. The ashy spread had a full extent of 
1.9m by 1.4m but was more concentrated over an 
area of 0.8m by 1.30m.
At the baulk the pit was 0.76m wide and 0.16m 
deep with sharply defined near vertical western 
and southern edges and a slope of 45 degrees on 
the east side. The lowest fill (1706) of red sandy 
clay including abundant charred remains was 
distinguishable from the upper fill by the greater 
density of inclusions excepting on the east edge. 
There, larger charcoal inclusions were at first 
interpreted as the remains of two stakes burnt in 
situ in cuts 504 and 505 but may have been the 
remains of wood left smouldering in the pit. The 
upper fill (1486) comprised yellowish red, gritty 
to gravelly, clay with relatively sparse inclusions 
of charcoal flecks and small lumps. Neither fill 
displayed clear signs of rapid formation and the 
upper fill seems more likely to have been formed 
by gradual silting up of the feature. Given the 
sharpness of the pit’s edges the process cannot have

been of long duration. All of the finds could have 
been part of the incidental accumulation of material 
following abandonment. 
The remaining features sealed by (1097/1731) 
and cutting the floor included at least 7 stake holes 
in a roughly rectilinear arrangement south-west of 
pit 293 and around a splayed V-profiled, 0.06m to 
0.08m deep, gully, 542, with a bulbous northern 
end, which produced two small pottery sherds 
and a single flint. It was not possible to determine 
whether or not slight depressions in the floor 
below (1736) and a single depression to its east were 
deliberately cut features. Despite the lack of clear 
evidence for in situ burning pit 293 is probably best 
interpreted as a hearth. Finds from the floor surface 
and features cutting it were very sparse compared 
with the sealing layer implying that it had been kept 
clean prior to abandonment.

The pits and their associated features
Pit 619, c. 8m south east of the floor, was also 
interpreted as a hearth. It was a roughly circular, 
steeply sloping cut of 0.90m diameter (Fig. 3B). On 
the northern side the base was a maximum of 0.11m 
below the old natural surface, but towards the centre 
the depth was only 0.09m. A stone rubber (Fig. 3B 
plate) was set in a shallow lens of sandy silt at the 
base of (1830), a more clayey deposit including 
sparse lumps of charcoal sealing the whole of the pit 
base. That in turn was sealed by an upper fill (1839) 
of similar material but lacking charcoal. 
Four stakeholes, varying in diameter from 0.04m 
to 0.11m, penetrated the base of the pit. All the cuts 
into the ground slanted away from the centre of the 
pit suggesting that the tops of the stakes may have 
converged over it. The initial filling of the pit was 
probably fairly rapid but there was no evidence that 
it had been deliberate. The character of the upper 
fill was consistent with natural silting. No evidence 
of in situ burning was noted. 
A second roughly circular pit, 726, was situated 
1.30m north of pit 619 (Fig. 4A). The steeply 
sloping-sided, truncated, conical cut had been dug 
to an almost level base at a depth of 0.37m below the 
natural surface. Thin primary silt (2347) including 
sparse lumps and flecks of charcoal was sealed 
beneath a complete saddle quern which had been 
laid face downwards, oriented from south-west 
to north-east. A lens of charcoal-rich sandy silt 
(2327) butting onto the long north-western edge of 
the quern was sealed partly by a small deposit of 
charcoal-free clay (2326). A deposit of sandy clay 
(2284) with moderate charcoal inclusions covered 
(2326) and the edge of the quern. The remainder of 
the quern was covered by similar soil (2294) with a 
higher concentration of carbonised material which 
had built up against the southern side of the quern. 
Charcoal was rare in sealing silty clay (2280) which 
had been cut by a Bronze Age posthole, 633.
The deposit below the quern had the appearance 
of basal silt which would have formed fairly rapidly 
from the natural and any covering soil after rainfall. 
The laying of the quern itself was clearly deliberate 
as was the covering of it with a charcoal-rich 
deposit. Thereafter, the pit appears to have silted 
up naturally. 
Three closely spaced stake or small postholes, 
628-30, forming a north to south-oriented 0.40m 
long line close to the north-west edge of the pit and 
two similar cuts, 627 and 628, within 1.25m of the 
pit’s northern edge (Fig. 2B) may have supported a 
windbreak.
Pit 652 was a roughly oval, steep-sided cut of 
1.09m from NNW to SSE and 0.80m from WSW 
to ENE (Fig. 4B). It was generally flat-bottomed at 
0.29m below the level of natural, excepting an oval 
cut, 664, towards the north end of the pit of 0.14m 
by 0.25m which was 0.02m deeper. It cut through 
the pit’s thin layer of sandy clayey basal silt (2209) 
which included only rare lumps of charcoal. 664 also 
cut a build up of sandy clay (1889) which included 
sparse to moderate amounts of carbonized material 
and lumps of soft, oxidized semi-baked clay. The 
cut itself was filled with loam-like soil (1900) with 
sparse inclusions of soft local sandstone and lumps 
of charcoal. It was sealed by a deposit of sandy clay 
(1888) including abundant carbonised hazel shell 
and a moderate number of pieces of partially baked 
clay. Around the sides of the pit (1888) was covered 
by orangey-red clay including only very sparse 
carbonized material. A 0.07m deep deposit of silty 
clay (1886) lying directly over (1888) and butting 
(1899) may have been cut towards its southern end. 
A substantial proportion of the site’s heavily burnt 
bone was recovered from these three contexts. A 
possible re-cut was filled with similar material 
(1887) which covered the entire surface of (1886). 
Both (1886) and (1887) contained very few charred 
remains. All of the middle and lower fills, with the 
exception of (2209) appeared to have been rapid 
deliberate deposits. In contrast, the upper fill of 
red sandy silt (1885) may have formed by slower, 
natural processes.
The distribution of the full range of finds by 
context in 652 is biased strongly towards the middle 
fills (Table 1) and the mean weight of pottery sherds 
in 1899 was at least twice that of those from other 
contexts and two of them appeared to be deliberately 
associated with a stone axe (Figs 4, plate; Fig. 5, 5 ). 
Finds were sparse in the primary and tertiary silts.
Pit 737 was similar in shape and orientation to 
pit 652 but much larger. It measured 1.83m from 
NNW to SSE and 1.30m from WSW to ENE (Fig. 
6). It was generally flat bottomed at 0.38m below 
the surface of an early soil (2308), which it cut, but 
dipped to up to 0.10m deeper at the southern end. 
There appeared to have been narrow horizontal cuts 
into the pit wall in two places low and one higher 
on the east side and in one place towards the south 
end of the west side. Pit 737 was the only Early 
Neolithic feature which demonstrably cut a soil 
horizon overlying natural. The entire northern and 
central pit floor was covered by a very thin film 
of red silty clay mottled with black carbon stains. 
It was sealed by 0.05m deep basal in-wash of silty

clay (2366) incorporating frequent small lumps of 
charcoal and some soft, fire-reddened, lumps of 
clay. The depression at the southern end may have 
been a cut through the pit floor made after the 
formation of (2366). It was filled with dark grey 
brown clayey loam (2365) with a much greater 
concentration of charcoal and fire-reddened clay 
than (2366). It had formed to a thickness which 
raised it slightly above the latter. Clayey silt (2362) 
spread over and entirely sealed (2366). On the west 
side of the pit a 0.87m long and 0.10m to 0.24m wide 
bank of gritty partially baked red clay (2364) lay 
over the central and southern areas of (2362) and 
the north of (2365). All the deposits were sealed 
by a middle and upper fill of red brown silty clay 
(2295) which included patchily frequent flecks and 
lumps of charcoal and rare flecks of baked clay. 
The lack of weathering of the pit sides implies that 
(2295) formed or was deposited over a fairly short 
period. The pit and fills were sealed by the slowly 
formed red silt (1065) which had been penetrated by 
a posthole 785 which cut through all the pit fills as 
far as the base.
The distinction in the volume of finds between 
the middle and other fills was less clear cut than 
in pit 652 but the overall proportion of complete 
flaked flints was greater (Fig. 7). However, there 
was a similarly strong bias of sherd size and number 
towards the middle fills and quern fragments were 
exclusive to them.

SOUTH CADBURY HILLTOP
The review of the Cadbury archive supports the 
Early Neolithic dating of 12 cut features within 
the area enclosed by (Fig. 8) and under (Fig. 9A) 
the inner bank of the hillfort. Further cuts had 
previously been allocated to the period based on red 
soil fills, offering the possibility of distinct feature 
clusters. However, some of these can be placed 
confidently within the Middle Bronze Age (Fig. 8). 
In general the cut feature together with its fills was 
the smallest unit of analysis during the excavations. 
In some instances individual fills were given 
complex descriptions but these were not sufficient 
to represent formation processes. Only the Early 
Neolithic features have been tabulated (Table 2) and 
only those with fuller records are described below.
Plateau
The plateau of Cadbury Castle comprises a ridge 
extending for c. 170m from west to east, scarped 
on the southern side and dipping more gently to 
the north. The trenches excavated from 1966-
70 were described as ‘sites’ and labeled from ‘A’ 
to ‘W’. Well-attested Early Neolithic features 
were identified in the western- and eastern-most

trenches and were most frequent towards the centre 
and at the eastern end. All were pits, excepting an 
apparently linear cut on Site E (Fig. 8, E886). 
A pit P152 cutting into the upper fill of pit P154 
and including a truncated human burial was filled 
with red clay which included some charred material 
within which hazel shell was noted (SCCA). 
Although probably Neolithic, it is likely to be of 
significantly later date than the lower pit. The fill 
of P154 was distinguishable from that of P152 by 
the relatively darker red clay. Charred material 
including hazel shell was present again (SCCA). 
The pit sides were nearly vertical and the base 
roughly level, extending below the deepest cut of the 
intrusive posthole P153 to give a length of 1.10m. It 
was 0.31m deep (Fig. 9B). The photographic record 
shows that a range of bone including cattle, pig, 
deer antler and a human mandible was discovered 
in mid fill during excavation in plan. Pit C817 also 
included human bone and the section drawing 
implies at least two different fills (Fig. 10A).
Pit P352 was truncated by an Iron Age roundhouse

gully, hence its full extent was not determined. It 
appeared to have been oval in plan and survived 
with extents of 0.80m by 0.50m to a depth of 0.30m 
(Fig. 10B). The single fill was noted to be dark red 
soil with inclusions of burnt rock (SCCA). 
E885 was described as a pit forming part of 
the southern end of an at least 6m long and up to 
0.22m deep south to north oriented U-shaped gully, 
E886. The section drawing suggests that it may 
have been cut by the gully and that the latter was 
approximately 1m wide (Fig. 10C). E886 resembles 
linear cuts which have formed parts of early 4th
millennium rectangular structures. However, 
associated features of comparable depth would 
have survived below the level of plough truncation 
on site E so that it is unlikely that there were any. 
The cuts and fills of the remaining plateau pits are 
summarized in Table 2 (Figs. 10D, 11 and 12A and 
B).
Below the inner bank
The inner bank on the south side of the hill sealed 
several features which were identified as Neolithic 
during the excavations. An area of disturbed natural 
interpreted as an old ground surface (D645) with 
sporadic inclusions of charcoal (D655) suggesting 
occupation was sealed beneath a deposit including 
Late Bronze Age pottery, D636 (Barrett et al. 2000, 
54). During its formation ‘at least a semicircle 
of small unburnt stones’ was laid out, partially 
enclosing a dense charcoal deposit and ‘many 
small burnt stones’ (D654) (SCCA). The feature 
was interpreted as a hearth and records show that 
Neolithic pottery was present, although it has not 
been found during the present research. Large 
sherds of pottery from a pit, D660, 2.6m north of 
D654, were exclusively Early Neolithic. The section 
drawing of the pit shows that the fill rose well 
above the level of the cut, forming a mound which 
survived presumably because it had been protected 
by later earthworks (Fig. 12C). The circular upper 
part of the pit was 0.80m in diameter and appeared 
to cut the fill of the lower part which had a smaller 
oval plan. Two large, flat stones appeared to have 
been laid in the middle of the lower cut fill.
The only other authenticated Neolithic context 
was a soil, A127, exposed under the north inner 
bank. This was dated by substantial sherds from a

Grooved Ware vessel. A stake hole (Alcock 1970, 
16, plate VIIa; 1972, 113, plates 21-2) found close 
to the sherds had been inserted into the soil during 
its formation and was presumed contemporary 
with the vessel. Unfortunately conflation of two 
unrelated contexts, A027 and A127, led to errors 
in the attribution of finds. It is likely that most, 
if not all, of 126 flint pieces allocated to the Iron 
Age ditch A027 were from A127. Some, possibly 
all, of 16 sherds allocated to A027 are likely to be 
Neolithic and one, at least, predates the Grooved 
Ware vessel.
The most expansive and densest area of 
potentially Neolithic features on the hilltop was 
identified on either side of the gate passage at site K. 
The features have been interpreted as components of 
two rectangular structures, K4 and K6 (Woodward 
and James 2000, 86-8; fig. 41). The features cut a 
‘frost-fractured or relaid’ reddish gravelly layer 
(SCCA). However, a very few flints, bones and three

indeterminate pottery sherds were the only finds 
from the features. At least three cuts, K845, K851 and 
K865, had ‘reddish’ fills but the soil colours for other 
features ranged from ‘dark brown soil’ and ‘brown’ 
to ‘orange brown’ (K551, K778, K788, K788, K875; 
SCCA). The conjoined pit-like linear features on the 
east side of the passage lacked positive evidence for 
dating beyond a later Bronze Age TAQ indicated by 
stratigraphy and radiocarbon dating. The pits and 
postholes west of the hollow appear to relate to the 
approach to the interior hence are unlikely to predate the later Bronze Age. Results of geophysical 
survey of the hillfort interior in 1992-3 showed a 
possible west to east oriented, 120m long hollow 
way 35m north of the south west gate (Johnson 
1993, 4.1, fig. 7; Tabor 2008, 44). It would have been 
a continuation of the western approach to the hill 
as it survives between the two outer ramparts and 
as such suggests that there had been more direct, 
and much steeper, route predating the ramparts and 
analogous to the opening on the east side of the hill. 
A hollow way on such a scale would not have formed 
prior to the Neolithic and is likely to have been many 
centuries in forming. Presumably the introduction 
of wheeled traffic necessitated the change of course 
to a gentler ascent via what became the south west 
gate. The lowest features below the inner bank may 
relate to that change.

REMARKS ON THE RADIOCARBON DATES
Leslie Alcock targeted radiocarbon dating at 
several potentially Neolithic contexts. In the 
event only two from secure contexts proved to be 
of the period, both from pit P154B, and although 
they overlapped, subsequent recalibration has 
broadened their combined time span at 2 sigma to 
3780-2780BC (Table 3; Alcock 1980, 708-9; Bayliss 
et al. 2000, 370-1). Both dates overlap with all the 
Milsoms corner dates at 2 sigma and all but one of 
them at 1 sigma. More significantly the Milsoms 
Corner dates correlate well with each other. If the 
outlying date from (2362) is excluded a centroid 
range of the remaining five dates is limited to 
3589 to 3579BC at 1 sigma and for all six dates the 
range extends from 3589 to 3502BC at 2 sigma. The 
clustering of the dates within a narrow span at 1 
Sigma implies that the filling of the pits took place 
either during a single episode or in several episodes 
over a short period. The mean of five centroid dates 
of 3582BC at 1 sigma may be more apposite than 
that of 3524BC for six dates at 2 sigma.
THE FINDS
Most of the finds assessed below are from contexts 
which either are, or may possibly be, of Early 
Neolithic date, or which occur in contexts of slow 
formation sealing deposits of that date or of wellprovenanced Late Neolithic date. The dating of all 
Milsoms Corner Early Neolithic features and the 
floor is very secure. Grooved ware and other sherds 
from site A and fragments from Middle Neolithic 
vessels from Sigwells, a little over 1km to the south 
east (Fig. 1B), have been described and illustrated 
below for the sake of completeness. The flints from 
a soil associated with the Grooved ware have been 
included as comparanda.
In addition to placing the Cadbury material in 
a regional context and to the dating of a general 
phase and of particular features the analyses 
address evidence for functional variations between 
the hilltop and the low spur and between individual 
features. Consideration is given also to whether or 
not comparable intra site patterns are discernible 
within Early Neolithic pit groups from much 
further afield.
The pottery
by Richard Tabor
The pottery comprises all of 161 sherds (1168g) 
from the securely dated pits at Milsoms Corner and 
380 sherds (2949g) from pits judged to be Early 
Neolithic on the South Cadbury hilltop. Most of the 
Milsoms Corner sherds had suffered badly from 
loss of inclusions whereas those from the hilltop 
had a much better retention rate. Whilst water will 
have played a part in the dissolving of calcareous 
inclusions the predominant limestone geology of the 
hilltop may have been more conducive to survival 
in contrast to the clayey sand of the spur. Some pits 
from the hilltop, notably F589, included significant 
amounts of Early Neolithic pottery but have been 
excluded as enough later pottery was also present 
to indicate that the feature was either disturbed or 
later but with residual material. The mean sherd 
weights from the two areas are respectively 7.3g 
and 7.8g but vary considerably from pit to pit. An 
assessment of the combined forms and fabrics 
of the two assemblages showed that there were a 
minimum of 12 vessels from Milsoms Corner and 
18 from the hilltop. The Milsoms Corner material 
was quantified within each fill and within each

pit but on the hilltop most pits were assigned only 
one fill and where more there was ambiguity of 
reference. The classification of rim and vessel 
forms was based on that developed for Windmill 
Hill and Carn Brea (Smith 1965, 48; 1981) and 
adjusted for Maiden Castle (Cleal 1991a, 173-9). 
Bracketed numbers in this section refer to sherds 
in figures 3-12.
The fabrics
All sherds were examined individually at x8 
magnification using a graduated linen tester 
lens. Three general ware groups were identified 
based on inclusions of grog or clay pellets, calcite 
and limestone mixtures, although it was often 
necessary to rely on the shape and size of voids for 
the Milsoms Corner assemblage in particular. The 
groups were subdivided according to the presence 
of other inclusions. 
Grog/clay pellet and mixtures
B Fine fabric including ovoid to multi-lobed 
iron-rich clay pellets, usually rounded (<1to 
3mm) with sparse subangular grains of 
quartz (<2mm). Red to buff brown exterior 
surfaces, dark grey interior surfaces. Poorly 
fired. Often soft.
V Coarse to moderate fabric, including 
abundant rounded or slitted voids and sparse 
to moderate clay pellets. The voids may 
indicate where fine crushed shelly limestone 
has dissolved. Surfaces are usually buff 
to grey. Poor to moderate firing. Probably 
equivalent to Fabric B.
Calcite and mixtures
Q A moderately coarse fabric including calcite 
rhombs, from <1 to 4mm. Buff brown to dark 
grey exterior, buff to light grey core and buff 
to dark grey interior. Moderately well fired.
E A coarse, friable fabric including including 
calcite rhombs, from <1.0 to 4.0mm and 
variable proportions of fossil plate and 
crushed shell. Buff to patchily oxidised red, 
exterior, buff to light grey core and buff to 
dark grey interior. Moderately well fired.
Fossiliferous limestone and mixtures
K Coarse to moderate, friable fabric including 
sparse to moderate plate and/or moderate to 
abundant crushed fossil shell and sparse grog 
pellets. Exterior surface colour ranges from 
buff pink to black. Interior surface ranges 
from buff, through light grey to dark grey. 
Moderately well fired.
R Coarse to moderate, friable fabric including 
sparse to moderate plate and/or moderate to 
abundant crushed fossiliferous limestone. 
Exterior surface colour ranges from reddish 
brown to black. Interior surface ranges 
from buff, through light grey to dark grey. 
Moderately fired.
S Fine fabric, including common angular 
and subangular voids and usually grog as 
well as sparse to moderate mica and rare to 
sparse iron. The voids may result from the 
dissolving of limestone/calcite. Typically, 
where vessels are thin-walled, the exterior 
shows traces of burnishing. The fabric is 
usually grey to black throughout, although 
occasionally buff. Often poor firing.
T Coarse to moderate fabric, including sparse 
to moderate crushed fossiliferous limestone 
and sparse to moderate quartz (up to 1 mm). 
Surfaces are usually buff to grey. Moderate 
firing.
Z Coarse to moderate fabric, including 
abundant rounded or narrow slitted voids. 
In the main the voids occur fossiliferous 
limestone has dissolved. Surfaces are usually 
buff to grey. Moderate firing. Equivalent to 
Fabric R.
Four Early Neolithic sherds from Milsoms Corner 
formed part of a sample of 24 spanning the Early 
Neolithic to Late Bronze Age submitted for 
petrological analysis by Professor Timothy Darvill, 
with PXRF chemical analysis by Derek Pitman and 
Kerry Barrass. The full range of sherds fell within 
three distinctive chemical groups, A to C. The four 
Early Neolithic sherds all belonged to group C 
which included ‘High levels of silica and very little 
calcium’ (Pitman & Barrass unpublished). The thin 
sections suggested that the sherds were distributed 
across three clay types, two of which, A and C, 
included at least moderate amounts of quartz. B was 
iron-rich and included clay pellets which resembled 
grog. Type A was strongly micaceous but the other 
two types were only slightly so. Two fabric S 
sherds, (3) and (10), were found to be respectively of 
clay types A and C and two sherds in fabrics B and 
V, (5) and (6), were both of clay type B. Iron rich, 
fine grained sandstone fragments were observed 
in (5) and may match a variety of Mendip Old Red 
Sandstone found in Iron Age Glastonbury Wares. 
Clay type C was noted to resemble Gault clay from

west Wiltshire, implying a source 10-20km east or 
north-east of Cadbury (Darvill unpublished).
The silicaceous character of the chemical 
group C sherds from Milsoms Corner undermines 
the calcareous interpretation of the voids in 
macroscopic fabrics S and V. As a consequence 
there is a considerable disparity between fabrics of 
sherds from the spur and the hilltop. Macroscopic 
identification on the hilltop was more reliable due 
the generally good survival of inclusions. At the 
very least it would appear that different sources 
were being used by the potters. It is notable that 
in many respects sherds in Fabric R have a strong 
resemblance to fossil shell tempered pottery current 
during much of the Iron Age which probably derived 
from very local sources.
Both shelly limestone and calcite mixtures 
feature in the Early Neolithic assemblage on 
broadly similar geology at Hazleton North (Smith 
& Darvill 1990, 141-5),
Decoration and surface treatment
The only unambiguously decorated sherd was 
from pit 737 (12). Sharply tooled cross-hatching 
on its exterior, forming oblongs, appears to be of a 
design unique for the period, although the tooling 
is comparable with that on the necks of some 
Mildenhall style vessels at Spong Hill (Healy 1988; 
fig. 70, P121). It is unclear whether parallel lines 
are on the inner or outer surface of a thin, very 
flaky sherd from pit F737 (11). There were similar 
markings on the inner surface of a thin sherd from 
Maiden Castle (Cleal 1991a; fig. 142, 19). A sharply 
incised, apparently horizontal groove on a sherd (8), 
possibly from bowl (6), is probably an impression 
left by a piece of organic matter.
The surfaces of Milsoms Corner vessels (1) 
to (6) were soapy to touch and may all have been 
burnished or smoothed although this could not be 
established with certainty due to their condition. 
No evidence was found for carbon ‘painting’ 
which has been posited for sherds from Carn Brea, 
Hembury, Windmill Hill, and the exceptionally 
well-preserved examples from the Sweet Track 
(Kinnes 1979, 52, Coles and Orme 1984, 44). The 
vulnerability of the surface treatment was noted at 
Hambledon Hill, where it survived on only a very 
few sherds from a large assemblage (Smith 2008, 
591) and it was not remarked upon at Maiden Castle 
(Cleal 1991a). However, Timothy Darvill has noted 
a possible ‘pink-red internal coating or slip’ on (10) 
from pit 737 (forthcoming, appendix 1) and a large 
straight-sided bowl from N297 retained smoothed, 
black surfaces.
Rim forms
Rims were classed in three tiers according to the 
dominant aspect of their physical form; the attitude 
of the rim in relation to vertical; and the finish of 
the rim. The rim form classes were: A – simple; B – 
rolled-over; C – outwardly expanded; E – T-shaped; 
and F – inwardly extended. The attitudes of the 
rims in relation to vertical were: 1 – out-turned; 
2 – upright; 3 – inturned. The finishes of the rims

EARLY NEOLITHIC PITS AT CADBURY CASTLE
were: a - rounded; b - tapered; c - flattened. All the 
illustrated rims can be classified according to these 
criteria, and across the three groups there are one or 
more examples of every class, although not of every 
combination of classes. (Tables 4 and 5). 
The most frequent variation between the two 
South Cadbury sites is the occurrence of external 
expansion of rims on the hilltop and its absence 
from the spur. Also worthy of note is the type E 
rim from pit 737 (10) and the type F from D660 
(33). Whilst the number of sherds is too small for 
meaningful statistical analysis it is notable that 
the latter types are rare elsewhere. No type E rims 
are recorded from Carn Brea, Maiden Castle and 
Whitesheet Hill (Smith 1981, 164; Cleal 1991a, 
173; Cleal 2004, fig.9) and they formed only 1.1% 
of the large assemblages from Hambledon Hill 
(Smith 2008, 589; fig. 9.7, P87, P94). However, they 
made up 12.7% of the classified rims at Windmill 
Hill (derived from Smith 1965, fig. 11), although 
that figure was inflated through the inclusion of 
Mortlake sherds. Type F rims are rare in Mildenhall 
assemblages but at Windmill Hill they accounted 
for 2.9% of the rims (derived from Smith 1965, fig. 
11) and for 1.3% and 0.7% of those at Hambledon 
Hill and Maiden Castle (Smith 2008, 589; Cleal 
1991a, table 56). The presence of one of each type 
from South Cadbury is surprising given the small 
assemblages. The prevalence of simple rims over 
rolled and externally expanded rims is typical, 
although not as pronounced as elsewhere.
Lugs and cordons
Five Early Neolithic lugs were recovered from 
Milsoms Corner and three from pits on the hilltop. 
Two horizontally perforated, round or knob-shaped 
lugs, one from pit 619, and one from a general layer 
were probably from a single highly burnished black 
vessel. The tenon survived on one as did a spread 
of sealing clay around it, strongly suggesting that 
it become detached from its socket (2). A sherd 
in pit 726 with an empty fully perforated socket 
immediately below the neck was from a vessel of 
similar fabric and finish (4). A larger vertically 
perforated knob was attached to a neutral bowl 
in D660 (32). Two horizontally perforated oval 
lugs were attached high on opposing shoulders of 
a vessel from pit 652 (6). Both of two horizontal 
elongated lugs were imperforate in pits 737 (10) and 
E774 (27). Shallow cordons on sherds from pits 652 
and N297, one with a D (5) and one with a V profile 
(25) appeared to have been moulded just above the 
line of maximum girth.
All of the lug types are represented elsewhere 
in South-Western Bowl assemblages although the 
distribution of types varies considerably. Perforated 
and imperforate oval lugs were well-represented at 
Carn Brea, Windmill Hill and Maiden Castle but 
round knob forms are rare and usually imperforate 
if they occur (Smith 1981, 168-70; 1965, 50; Cleal 
1991a, 179-80). The absence of trumpet lugs in the 
Cadbury area may be due to the assemblage size, 
although a smaller group from Whitesheet Hill

includes an example (Cleal 2004, P17). The instance 
of lugs is generally higher in the south-west than 
in the east of England. Nine were found at Staines 
(Robertson-Mackay 1987, 88), only one at Spong 
Hill (Healey 1988, 65) and two at Kilverstone 
(Knight 2006, 30-1), all from substantial Early 
Neolithic assemblages.
Vessel forms
The tripartite classificatory system distinguishes 
between open bowls for which the maximum 
outer diameter is at the rim (A), neutral bowls for 
which the rim diameter is equal to the maximum 
body diameter (B) and closed bowls for which the 
maximum diameter occurs on the main body of the 
vessel (C). The groups were subdivided according 
to whether they were carinated (1), uncarinated 
(2), ‘S’-profiled (3) or of undetermined carination 
(0). The S-profiled bowls from Milsoms Corner 
are distinguished by long necks contrasting with 
the shorted-necked vessels to which the term was 
applied at Kilverstone (Knight 2006, 29).
Refitting provided sufficient profiles for 
classification of eight vessels from Milsoms 
Corner and 18 from the hilltop (Tables 6 and 7). 
Open, uncarinated (A2), predominantly large, 
bowls comprised the greatest part of the hilltop 
assemblage (16-18, 20, 24, 27, 28, 30) in contrast to 
the spur where no open bowls were found. Two large 
closed bowls (C3) were ‘S’-profiled (5, 6) but on 
the hilltop a cup from D660 was sharply carinated 
(33). The rim diameters of closed uncarinated (C2) 
bowls were determinable only for a very large 
bowl from the hilltop (31) and for a small medium 
(3) and a very large vessel from the spur, the latter 
having a horizontal elongated oval lug (10). Neutral 
uncarinated vessels included a plain bowl from pit 
737 (13) and a bowl with a vertically perforated lug 
from D660 (32).
There are marked differences in vessel forms 
between the South Cadbury hilltop and Milsoms 
Corner assemblages, although both fit well with 
variants of the South-Western Bowl style (Cleal 
1991b, 134). The Milsoms Corner assemblage 
includes burnished, ‘S’-profiled, bowls, with and 
without lugs, a slightly closed lugged vessel and 
simple closed bowls, various rims and at least 
one, possibly two, decorated sherds, (11) and (12).

EARLY NEOLITHIC PITS AT CADBURY CASTLE
Although no re-fitting sherds were identified 
between pits it is very probable that pieces from two 
vessels were distributed across Milsoms Corner pits 
619, 652 and 726. Bowl rim (3) from 619 appears to 
form the upper part of base (9) and rim sherd (1) 
was very similar to an unillustrated example from 
652. There is also a strong possibility that the lug 
(2) from 619 had fitted a sherd (4) from 726. The 
assemblage was derived almost entirely from pits, 
all of which contained charred hazelnut shell in 
varying degrees of abundance. This has allowed 
dating of a small but diagnostically rich assemblage 
of pottery to within a narrow time span centred on 
a calibrated centroid date of around 3580BC at 1 
sigma.
It would be misleading to regard the Cadbury 
Castle pottery as a single assemblage, since it may 
represent several discrete episodes of deposition 
in widely separated parts of the hilltop. It is also 
possible that residual sherds of the period are 
concealed within the Iron Age assemblages. The 
pottery from the diverse pits beneath the Iron Age 
inner bank and on the plateau, comprises near 
straight-sided open bowls, neutral and closed bowls 
and a carinated cup, and includes vessels with 
horizontally and vertically perforated lugs. 
There is little to suggest that vessel form 
influenced the choice of clay mixtures of pottery 
from within each of the two areas (Tables 8 and 9). 
However, it is noteworthy that Fabric S dominated 
at Milsoms Corner where the most elaborate forms 
occurred. It may have been favoured for production 
of finer bowls.
The wider context
Well-dated Early Neolithic pottery assemblages 
from Somerset are sparse compared with those of 
neighbouring counties. Among the most significant 
remains a small assemblage from beside the Sweet 
Track, near Glastonbury which included sharply 
carinated neutral to slightly open bowls, considered 
to be a rarity in south west Britain at the time of their 
discovery (Smith 1976). They strongly resemble 
bowls from the east of England (i.e. Healy 1988, fig. 
73, P168 and fig. 74, P170-6) and are now treated as 
exemplars of Carinated Bowl pottery which at 68% 
probability had currency within a range of 4080BC 
to 3595BC (Bayliss et al. 2011, 759, fig. 14.87, 1). 
They would have been deposited within a very few 
years following the track’s construction, given as 
3807-6BC by dendrochronology, over two centuries 
earlier than the probable date of the Milsoms Corner 
assemblage. The absence of Carinated Bowls 
from the hilltop assemblage implies that it is also 
later and it is notable that they featured only very 
sparsely at the important South-Western Bowl sites 
of Hembury and Windmill Hill (examples include 
Liddell 1931, P144; 1932, P254; and, decorated, 
Smith & Keiller 1965, fig. 26, P164).

and neutral bowls in the hilltop assemblage is 
comparable with the much larger assemblage from 
Maiden Castle where they accounted respectively 
for 20.9% and 52.2% of the assemblage. The latter’s 
lack of closed carinated bowls and relative paucity 
of closed uncarinated bowls (7.5%) (Cleal 1991a, 
table 57) contrasts sharply with the Milsoms Corner 
assemblage. However, individually comparable 
bowls occur at the two sites. The large, closed bowl 
(5) from pit F652 is of similar profile to a vessel from 
Maiden Castle (Cleal 1991a, fig. 142, 11). Both have 
a shallow moulded cordon slightly above the level 
of maximum girth, although the simple everted 
rim of the Maiden Castle example contrasts with 
the pronounced outward roll of that from Milsoms 
Corner. The outwardly rolled and upright rounded 
rims from pits 652 (7) and 619 (1) are probably from 
vessels with broadly similar profiles, examples of 
which have been found in east Somerset on the 
site of a chambered tomb at Fromefield (Vatcher 
and Vatcher 1973, 22; fig. 2), and in Wiltshire at 
Whitesheet Hill (Cleal 2004, fig. 9, P5) and in a pit 
below Amesbury barrow G132 (Gingell 1988, 41; 
fig. 18, 3).
Simple hemispherical bowls with simple rounded 
or tapered rims such as the closed bowl in pits F619 
(3) and F652 (9) and a neutral bowl from pit 737 
(13) are a well established element of the SouthWestern Bowl style and occur amongst other sites 
at Carn Bea (Smith 1981, fig. 71, P113, P119; P115, 
P117, P121), Hambledon Hill (Smith 2008, fig. 9.5, 
P59; P60), Maiden Castle (Cleal 1991a, fig. 145, 16; 
fig. 142, 7) and Whitesheet Hill, (Cleal 2004, fig. 
9, P13-15). A small bowl with a similar inwardly 
extended rim from Windmill Hill (Smith 1965, fig. 
23, P128) is analogous to the carinated cup from 
D660. The Windmill hill bowl differed in having 
vertically perforated lugs and fingertip impressions 
on top of the rim.
Although sherds from only a small number of 
vessels were recovered from Milsoms Corner and 
Cadbury Castle the overall assemblage includes a 
broad range of representative Early Neolithic vessel 
types recognisable from within the wider region 
and much further afield. Despite there differences 
both groups fit well within the South-Western Bowl 
style.
The Middle and Late Neolithic pottery
by Richard Tabor
Firmly datable Middle and Late Neolithic pottery 
is restricted to just two locations, respectively 
Sigwells and Cadbury Castle. A single sherd 
from a soil horizon associated with substantial 
fragments from a single Grooved ware vessel has 
traits suggestive of a 4th millennium BC date but is 
included here because of the association.
34 C0, V: Rounded, outwardly expanded and 
tapering rim, with a chevron-like arrangement 
of slanted incised decoration on top. SC A127.
35 Mortlake sub-style, AB1: Rows of sort 
twisted cord on upper interior wall of vessel. 
Moderately hard grey brown fabric including 
sparse to moderate flint and rare coarse 
rounded quartz. Sig Tr13 057/175.
36 Mortlake sub-style, AB2: Rows of short 
twisted cord crescents on wall. Moderately 
hard, dark brown fabric with pink exterior 
margin including grog with sparse angular 
flint (<6mm) and rare red iron oxide. Sig Tr13 
254/5.
37 Fengate sub-style, A: Trapezoidal profiled rim 
with parallel oblique twisted cord impressions 
on the outer, top and inner surfaces. Corky 
dark grey fabric with buff brown exterior 
including moderate dark and pale grey grog. 
Sig Tr13 166/2.
38 Fengate sub-style, AB2: Slightly stepped, 
trapezoidal-profiled rim with parallel oblique 
incisions on rim and stabbed impressions in 
its overhang. Moderately hard dark grey fabric 
with buff reddish brown exterior including 
sparse to moderate calcined flint and sparse 
grey grog. Sig Tr6 F6504 K/5; north barrow 
ring ditch.
39 Grooved Ware, V: Neutral bowl with internally 
thickened rim. Four horizontal incised lines 
over incised chevrons grouped within triangles 
alternating with stabbed marks in offset rows.
The rim sherd with earlier traits (Fig. 13, 34) 
is comparable with incurving bowls which are 
sparse components of earlier Neolithic Decorated 
Bowl assemblages (Smith 1965, fig. 27, P182, 
P195; Kinnes 1998, fig. 182, M93) more generally 
associated with upright or near upright necked 
bowls, especially where the incisions are of chevron 
form (Healey 1988, 93, fig. 92, P193). Although 
both chevron incisions and outwardly tapering 
rims feature in Mortlake sub-style the vessel form 
implies a mid 4th millennium BC date. 
The occurrence of three sherds of Mortlake and 
two of Fengate sub-style pottery on the Sigwells 
plateau contrasts with the absence of such material 
from all methods of investigation elsewhere in the

study area. The largest Mortlake sherd, mentioned 
but not described and missing at the time of writing, 
was from Trench 7 (Leach in Leach and Tabor 
1996, 6). The two small Mortlake sherds from the 
Iron Age north west enclosure (Fig. 13, 35 and 
36) are comparable respectively with sherds from 
much larger assemblages from Cranborne Chase at 
Handley Hill Barrow 26 (Cleal 1991b, 159; fig. 7.12, 
P132) and Wor Barrow (Cleal 1991b, 161, P171). One 
Mortlake sherd was found within 2m of one of the 
Fengate sherds (Fig. 13, 37), the latter similar to 
material from Thickthorn Down long barrow, most 
notably rim P158 (Cleal 1991b, fig. 7.14). The other 
sherd of the sub-style (Fig. 13, 38), found 200m to 
the east in the ring ditch of the northern Sigwells 
round barrow, is broadly similar in profile.
The sherds from a single Grooved Ware bowl 
(Fig. 13, 39) sealed beneath the north Iron Age inner 
bank on Cadbury Castle remain the only examples 
of the style recovered from the study area. The 
flattened horizontal grooves below the vessel’s rim, 
staggered oval stabs within probably triangular 
outlines and multiple chevrons are typical of the 
Clacton sub-style. The curving inward thickening 
of the rim is similar to rim-type 28 at Durrington 
Walls although at that site it was associated with 
a vessel decorated in the Woodlands sub-style 
(Longworth 1971, 56-7; 139, fig. 58, P462). A 
similar rim featured on a Clacton sub-style vessel 
from Firtree Field, Cranborne Chase (Cleal 1991b, 
fig. 7.5, P26). In southern Britain Grooved Ware 
remains sparse west of Dorchester.
The flint
by Richard Tabor
Each flint was measured according to specifications 
set out by Saville (1980, 1981) and inspected 
individually at x8 magnification using a graduated 
linen tester lens. For the purpose of comparative 
analysis the length:breadth and breadth:length ratios 
of complete flakes and blades were calculated. The 
former is recommended by Saville but the latter is 
used here for ease of comparison with a selection of 
Early Neolithic assemblages (Healey & RobertsonMackay 1983, 8-12; Edmonds & Bellamy 1991, 215-
8; Harding 1991, table 11: Saville 1981, tables 19-22; 
Beadsmoore table 2.17). Flakes with a length of less 
than 20mm have been excluded from analysis at 
most other sites, partly as mitigation for the lower 
recovery rate of smaller items and partly because 
the proportions of small preparation flakes show 
less patterning. At Milsoms Corner all the cut 
features were excavated by trowel and that is likely 
to be true of those on the hilltop, hence only pieces 
of 12mm length or shorter have been excluded to 
increase the size of the sample. A very detailed 
tool type classification was applied to all the SCEP 
assemblages but the sample size for the Early 
Neolithic alone is too small to warrant its use here.
Milsoms Corner’s Early Neolithic flint 
assemblage is from securely dated contexts, with 
the exception of soil (1097/1731) which may have 
formed over a long period covering the floor 
surface (1469) and hearth pit 293. The pit data 
have been used in the assessment of the hilltop 
assemblages for which selection of material has 
been more problematic because the dating of 
several contexts is less secure and has been partly 
determined by analysis of their flint. Metrical data 
from pits and other horizons have been presented 
in Table 10 as overall assemblages for pits and for 
general horizons and for individual pits where the 
assemblages exceed 100 pieces. An exception was 
made for pit E774 to allow data to be included from 
a second hilltop pit. In addition the table includes 
flint from two contexts from site D associated with 
a hearth and thought to have constituted an Early 
Neolithic occupation layer (D645 and D655) and 
from a thick deposit sealed beneath the inner north 
bank and apparently dated by substantial fragments 
from a Grooved Ware vessel. The latter was deemed 
the only secure Late Neolithic context in the entire 
South Cadbury study area and the flint from it 
was intended as a control for variation over time

EARLY NEOLITHIC PITS AT CADBURY CASTLE
(although see above for a caveat regarding wrong 
numbering).
The individual assemblages show considerable 
variation in treatment. At Milsoms Corner 75% of 
322 pieces from pit 652 were heat affected, often 
calcined, distorting the overall percentage for the 
pits. None of nine pieces and only 11.6 % of 69 
from hearth pits 293 and 619 were burnt. Burnt 
pieces comprised 13.8% of the material from the 
layer (1097/1731) sealing 293 and the ashy floor 
(1469) but 40.8% of the material from the hilltop 
layer (D645/655). The percentage of retouched 
material was very high both on the spur and on the 
hilltop. Comparison of the pit assemblages shows 
retouching of 19.3% of flakes from the Milsoms 
Corner pits, rising to 22.6% with the inclusion 
of blades and bladelets. For the hilltop pits the 
percentages are respectively 12.1% and 13.0%.
In other respects there are marked differences 
between the spur and the hilltop. Whilst the number 
of bladelets from each group is too small for 
inference, blades (defined as proportionately long 
flakes with parallel sides and here including broken 
examples) formed 9.3% of the Milsoms Corner 
pit assemblage but only 2.1% of the hilltop pit 
assemblage. There was a similar disparity between 
the sealing layers.
The summary of all pits shows that 43.7% of flakes 
from Milsoms Corner pits were of a breadth:length 
which was less than 3:5 compared with 39.3% for 
the hilltop (Table 10). However, there was a marked 
difference in the proportion of breadths of 5:5 or 
greater which accounted for 15.5% of the flakes 
from the Milsoms Corner pits and 28% of those on 
the hilltop. A comparison of the layer sealing the 
Milsoms Corner floor and occupation layer from 
Site D shows a nearly 10% difference between the 
spur and the hilltop for both sets of figures. On 
this evidence the hilltop soil formations and some 
features may be later. The same variables would 
assign the presumed later deposit A127 a later date 
than that implied by the mean for the hilltop pits and 
for the occupation layer on Site D. The combined 
percentages of blades and bladelets show a similar 
trend. They represent 11.6% of the Milsoms Corner 
pits assemblage, 3.2% of the hilltop pits assemblage 
and only 1.5% of the A127 assemblage.
Also of relevance to the Cadbury material are 
variations in butt width and platform abrasion, 
both of which were noted as altering over time 
in a comparison of stratified assemblages from 
the South Dorset Ridgeway Project (Harding & 
Bellamy 1991, 87; table 16). The mean width of 
butts from the hilltop pits was 2.2mm compared 
with 1.6mm for those from the Milsoms Corner 
pits. The difference shows more acutely in the 
percentages of butts which are up to 1mm wide with 
a nearly 20% difference between the two areas. 
In fact, both areas have very high percentages in 
this range compared with an Early Neolithic pit at 
Rowden so that it would be unwise to conclude that 
the variation was due to the lapse of time (Harding 
1991, table 8). However, the incidence of abrasion of 
butts from hilltop pits at 13.6% was less than a third 
of the rate for the Milsoms Corner pits.
Whilst it is reasonable to assume that all the 
pits at Milsoms Corner were filled over a short 
period and hence that the proportionately low 
number of long flakes from 652 is not a function of 
technological change over time there is no evidence 
that the hilltop pits were closely contemporary with 
each other or with those on the spur. As only one 
pit included more than 100 pieces of flint reliable 
statistical inferences cannot be made about their 
sequence in relation to each other. However, seven 
of 12 complete flakes from T269 (58.4%) had a 
breadth:length ratio of less than 3:5 and for five 
of these the ratio was less than 2:5, offering the 
possibility that this pit may be the earliest identified 
on the hilltop.
The relative proportions of flint and other stone 
tools on the hilltop and the spur are remarkably 
similar (Tables 11 and 12). Piercers are hugely 
dominant at around 70% followed by scrapers at 
around 10% and knives as 6-8%. Quern fragments 
also made up around 8% of all stone tools, although 
the 1% within the Milsoms Corner assemblage 
for each of a complete quern and a rubber is 
probably a better representation of the proportional 
relationship between milling and other stone tools. 
No axes were found in the hilltop’s Neolithic 
pits, although at least a dozen were found during 
Alcock’s excavations and another during St George 
Gray’s earlier campaign. It seems likely that one 
from D646 was in a genuinely Early Neolithic 
context as that layer was sealed by occupation 
horizon D645/655. The axe from pit 652 was the 
sole example from the spur (see Williams, below). 
Half of a perforated possible sandstone bead was 
found in a fill butting against the complete quern 
in pit 726.
In general the variety and number of tools within 
each pit may relate to pit size. At Milsoms Corner 
pit 737 had nearly twice the capacity of 652 which 
in turn was bigger than the other pits. Despite this, 
the low flint count and the inclusion of only a single

EARLY NEOLITHIC PITS AT CADBURY CASTLE
tool from the floor/hearth area 1469/293 is striking 
and may reflect use of the area as shelter rather than 
a work space. 
The evidence for use of flakes and blades as tools 
derives either from use-wear or retouch. Wear on 
flakes from pits on the hilltop at 10.7% was nearly 
double that on the spur. It has been noted already that 
the percentage of retouched material was very high 
in both areas. In contrast, at Maiden Castle retouch 
was recorded on less than 2.5% of flakes from the 
Early Neolithic phase (Edmonds & Bellamy 1991, 
table 75a); at Spong Hill on 5.6% of all struck pieces 
from feature groups of the period (from Healey 1988, 
fig. 33); and at Kilverstone all flakes and blades 
exhibiting retouch or other signs of use amounted to 
6% (Beadsmoore 2006, 64). However, those three 
sites differ from Cadbury in that they all have ready 
access to flint. It had to be imported to Carn Brea 
and whilst there was considerable variation within 
the twelve excavated areas retouched pieces formed 
20% of the assemblage in one and exceeded 12% in 
four (Saville 1981, table 3). The implication is that 
flint was used much more economically in places 
where it was not readily available.

37km (14–23 miles) distant. There are four main 
areas of Old Red Sandstone in the Mendips, and 
further fieldwork might provide pointers to suggest 
from where the stone utilised at Milsoms Corner 
may have been collected. This variety of Old Red 
Sandstone is not the stone from Beacon Hill, which 
appears to have been used predominantly for rotary 
querns, but a feldspathic and micaceous sandstone 
with a tendency to break naturally into flat slabs. A 
similar variety of Old Red Sandstone was used for 
Neolithic querns at Hambledon Hill, but these were 
all fragmentary (Roe 2008, 633-5).
The complete saddle quern from context 2284 
is of particular interest as it provides the hitherto 
missing details of the size and weight of such 
early querns. At a weight of 15.750 kg the question 
arises as to how this bulky object may have been 
transported to the site. The finds from the South 
Cadbury Environs excavations clearly demonstrate 
the long use of this micaceous sandstone in the 
area. It was used for a number of saddle querns 
from earlier Iron Age contexts at Cadbury Castle 
(Roe 2000, 263).
The stone axe from F652
by David Williams
The majority of a Neolithic ground and polished 
hand axe, weathered and decomposed and 
substantially burnt at some stage. The surface is 
pitted here and there by weathering and burning 
but still retains some areas that are smooth and 
show the original polish The axe is roughly oval in 
section and tapers from a damaged broad cutting 
edge, now somewhat truncated, towards a narrow 
butt end. The dimensions of this broken axe are: 
Length: 168mm; maximum Width: 56mm tapering 
to: 25mm; maximum Thickness: 100mm tapering 
to: 20mm.
A close visual examination with the aid of a 
hand-lens [x 10] suggested that the axe has been 
made from a greenstone, a medium- to coarsegrained basic intrusive igneous rock. The axe had 
previously been drilled into the core of the broken 
cutting edge. Not all of the cylindrical sample 
had originally been detached and it was possible 
to carefully prise away a small section that had 
remained in the drilled hole. This small circular 
piece was then made into a thin section and studied

under the petrological microscope. This showed 
that the rock contains plentiful, medium-grained, 
dark coloured grains of clinopyroxene and fibrous 
amphibole, set in a slightly lighter coloured matrix 
of altered felspar. The composition and texture of 
the minerals suggests that the rock is an uralitized 
gabbro and belongs to the Implement Petrology 
Committee’s Group 1, which has a Cornish origin, 
almost certainly coming from the area of Mount’s 
Bay, near Penzance (McK Clough and Cummings, 
1979; 1988; Cummins, 1983). This was one of the 
main sources for Neolithic polished stone axes and 
its products have a wide distribution covering much 
of England.
The human remains
by Susan Jones and Clare Randall
A small group of human remains from Cadbury 
Castle was examined as part of a separate research 
project which was focussed on the ‘Massacre 
Deposits’ in the south west gateway of the hillfort 
and dating to the very end of the Iron Age or 
Romano-British period (Jones 2008; Jones and 
Randall 2010). As this material was studied with 
a focus on understanding disarticulated and comingled remains, a zoning system was developed, 
and particular attention paid to taphonomic 
markers and modification in order to understand 
the processes involved in the formation of deposits 
(Jones 2008, 19-23). Remains were identified from 
all phases of the use of Cadbury Castle, although 
the vast majority of the material was from contexts 
which were 1st millennium BC or later. 
Human remains occurred in a total of three 
Neolithic contexts, P154, P152 (Fig. 9, plate), and 
C817 (Fig. 10B). The remains from P154 were 
not available for examination but could be seen 
in photographs in the site archive. The material 
comprised (according to a report by D. Lunt in the 
archive) an entire mandible and partial maxilla of 
an adult individual. Lunt assessed the mandible 
as having male traits and aged (presumably from 
dental eruption and wear) 20-25 years of age.
A group of partially articulated remains 
occurred in P152. This comprised an articulated 
portion of the rib cage and vertebral column, from 
the first thoracic vertebra down to the second 
lumbar vertebra, with the majority of the ribs on 
the right hand side absent. Associated with this 
were the disarticulated remains of part of the 
right radius and ulna, the right hand (including 
the carpals) and the left hand. A mandible is also 
shown in the photographs in the site archive, but 
was not available for examination. Measurements 
of the glenoid of the scapula, the radial head and 
the length of the sternum were consistent with the 
range attributable to a female individual. Some 
slight degenerative change might indicate an older 
adult, although this is tentative. It seems that this 
may have represented a more complete interment 
which had been disturbed, redeposited or cut 
through.
A total of 31 skull fragments came from pit C817, 
and comprised vault fragments, nasal bones and 
one zygomatic bone, and there were a minimum of 
three individuals present. The fragments indicated 
differing degrees of cranial suture closure. Whilst 
suture closure can be variable, it appears to indicate 
that the fragments were derived from at least one 
juvenile, a younger adult and a middle aged adult. 
These fragments had a more weathered appearance, 
and may well have already been fragmented and 
possibly exposed to the elements prior to burial. 
However, none of the fragments showed any signs 
of gnawing.
As a small assemblage, it is difficult to draw 
significant conclusions from this material. However, 
it appears to indicate that there may have been more 
than one practice in respect of the manipulation and 
deposition of human remains being carried out in 
this period of the use of the hill. 
The Faunal Remains
by Clare Randall
Faunal remains were recovered from both Milsoms 
Corner and Cadbury Castle in the respective 
excavations of each. The Early Neolithic faunal 
assemblage from Cadbury Castle is part of a 
much larger collection which was recovered 
during excavation between 1966 and 1970 and 
dates to phases between the Early Neolithic and 
the medieval period. The material from Milsoms 
Corner is from a similarly multi-phase assemblage. 
Both assemblages were recorded by the author 
between 2007 and 2009 as part of a PhD research 
project (Randall 2010), but the Neolithic material 
fell outwith the chronological focus of that project.
Methods
Each bone fragment was identified where possible 
to element and species, and where this was not 
possible Large Mammal (e.g. cattle or horse-sized), 
Medium Mammal (e.g. sheep-sized, but potentially 
pig) and Unidentified Mammal categories. This 
included axial elements identifiable to species. 
Identification was carried out using comparative

SOMERSET ARCHAEOLOGY AND NATURAL HISTORY, 2017
collections and standard reference works Zones 
were recorded where possible for each anatomical 
element using the Maltby/Hambleton method (n.d.). 
Species abundance was considered in respect 
of number of identified specimens (NISP), or 
number of fragments for material not identified to 
species, as well as minimum number of individuals 
(MNI) All data were recorded in an Access 
relational database, which is included in the project 
archive.
Data were recorded with respect to bone 
condition, percentage and zone(s) of the element 
present, pathological changes, breakage patterns, 
butchery, sex, gnawing and weathering indicators. 
Burnt bone was recorded by colour. Where 
available the eruption and wear of teeth of cattle, 
sheep/goat, and pig was assessed and assigned 
categories using Grant (1982), Payne (1973, 1982), 
Hambleton (1999) and Halstead (1985). Bone 
porosity was recorded for all fragments, and each 
fragment examined for fusion information which 
was assigned to age ranges using Silver (1969). 
Metrical data were recorded in accordance with von 
den Driesch (1976). Further detail of both methods 
and calculations are included in the project archive.
Results
Milsoms Corner
A total of 244 fragments of animal bone were 
recovered from 20 contexts (Table 14). The vast 
majority of the material came from the series 
of pits, although there were small quantities of 
unidentifiable material from postholes and general 
layer (1731). The material was predominantly 
unidentifiable (only 2% identified to species) and 
very fragmented, with the vast majority of the 
material of Poor or Poor-Average condition. The 
bulk of the assemblage (212 fragments) was burned. 
Of these 161 (76%) fragments were completely 
calcined, with 9 classed as grey, indicating a very 
thorough and deliberate combustion. 41 fragments 
were buff in colour and 1 brown, indicating a lower 
temperature/duration of burn in the presence of 
oxygen. A large proportion of the material was 
concentrated in three contexts (1886), (1888) and 
(1899), with all the material in the former two being 
heavily burned and over 80% of the latter context. 
This type of treatment may have been directly 
related to the act of pit deposition, although small 
amounts of burned material also occurred in the 
limited assemblage which did not originate from pit 
fills. The species identified were cattle, sheep/goat 
(single examples of each) and pig (three fragments), 
and no further information was available.
Cadbury Castle
A total of 698 fragments were recovered from 
16 contexts, mainly within pits (676 fragments) 
but also representing a possible slot trench (22 
fragments) (Table 14). 58% of the material could 
be identified to species. 91% of the material had 
Average or Average-Good bone condition. The 
quantity of bone in the different types of context 
is too small to enable consideration of differentials 
in preservation. Whilst the material is generally 
fragmentary, only 14% of identified mammal bone 
comprised loose teeth. No associated bone groups 
(ABGs) were noted.
The species identified were cattle, sheep/goat, 
pig, dog, fox, roe deer and red deer. The majority 
of the material related to the three main livestock 
species, with a small number of dog fragments, 
and a total of three fragments from wild species. 
Pig were the most numerous species by number of 
identified specimens (NISP) (59% of the three main 
livestock species), with a lesser representation of 
cattle (24%) and sheep/goat in the minority (17%). 
The larger number of pigs is also reflected in the 
minimum number of individuals, with pig bone 
originating from at least seven animals, cattle four, 
and sheep/goat, five. Whilst cattle and sheep/goat 
have reversed rank order by minimum number of 
individuals (MNI), cattle would still have been 
economically more significant, given their size and 
increased dairying potential. 
Only 16 examples of butchery were noted on 
cattle, sheep/goat and pig (amounting to 2% of 
the whole assemblage). Virtually all were fine 
cuts which can be associated with the skinning or 
dismemberment of the carcass. Thirteen examples 
of breakage of the bone when fresh were noted (2% 
of the total assemblage), with cattle, sheep/goat and 
pig as well as cattle-sized and sheep-sized animals 
involved. A total of 75 fragments had taphonomic 
changes noted (in some cases more than one). 
Gnawing occurred at a rate of 1% of the assemblage. 
This is relatively low, and potentially reflects only 
a small population of dogs indicated by the handful 
of dog bone, or limitation of access of dogs to the 
material. Weathering was rare (4%). Both of these 
measures appear to indicate, alongside the generally 
good condition of the bone that the material was 
relatively rapidly incorporated into the fills, and 
protected from scavenging animals and aerial 
weathering effects. Burnt fragments accounted for

EARLY NEOLITHIC PITS AT CADBURY CASTLE
5% of the assemblage. It does not appear however 
that there was any concentration in particular 
features or contexts with weathered, burned and 
gnawed material spread across the features. Cattle 
could be argued to have been disproportionately 
affected by weathering, but the numbers are too 
small to be definitive. This may be a function of 
the size of the fragments leading to them remaining 
exposed to the elements for longer. 
Three pits had particularly high concentrations 
of faunal remains (Table 15). Examination of 
D660 (including its contexts A and B; total of 
131 fragments, E885 (total 132 fragments) and 
P154 (including its context B; 161 fragments), 
may indicate that they accumulated from slightly 
different events than the general accumulation of 
occupation debris. E885 actually had a far lower 
proportion of material identified to species (30% in 
contrast to 58% for the entire Neolithic assemblage). 
Within the 40 fragments identified, cattle comprised 
16 fragments (40%), pig 12 fragments (30%) and 
sheep/goat two fragments (5%). The majority of the 
bone scored as Average condition, but notably 12% 
was weathered (Table 14). This contrasts with D660 
in which the majority of the bone was of AverageGood condition, and no weathering was noted. In 
this case 36 identified fragments (54%) were sheep/
goat, with 20 (30%) pig, and 11 fragments of cattle 
(16%). P154 had a similar profile of bone condition, 
with 75% of the material scoring Average-Good, 
and no weathering. Here there were three cattle 
fragments (3%), two sheep/goat fragments (2%) 
and 97 fragments (95%) of pig. No butchery was 
recorded for E885, but there were three examples 
each in the other two features. Especially in the 
last case, it seems that we should consider a highly 
specific consumption event having produced the 
deposit. 
Cattle
Cattle was the second most abundant species (24% 
of NISP). A total of 98 fragments were identified as 
cattle, with 109 fragments relating to cattle-sized 
animals. The minimum number of individuals was 
four, a minimum of three adult animals and one 
juvenile animal. Aging information was limited 
as there were no mandibles or even mandibular 
loose teeth which could be assigned a wear stage. 
A deciduous maxillary tooth was unworn, and a 
permanent maxillary molar worn. There were only 
five porous fragments. 24 elements gave fusion 
information. Slightly more than half were fused, 
with a weighting to early fusing elements. However 
there were two unfused early fusing elements (<7-10

months). The presence of older animals is attested 
by three fused proximal femurs (>42 months). The 
small amount of porous bone would indicate that 
younger animals were present and may have been 
being reared on or near the site. Two measurements 
for the breadth of the distal humerus (BT = 68.5mm 
and 77.7mm) fall into the female category of size 
identified at Windmill Hill, Hambledon Hill, and 
Durrington Walls (cf. Serjeantson 2011, 21). It is 
probable that cattle were being kept and utilised for 
both primary and secondary products. 
All areas of the body were represented including 
the head, axial skeleton (albeit with under 
representation of the spine), limbs and feet (Fig. 
14). Meat bearing elements are well represented, 
including the innominate, scapula, humerus 
and femur. However, the presence of peripheral 
elements including the heads and feet seems 
to indicate that the whole animal was available 
and processed on site or close by. There are five 
examples of butchery on cattle bone, all light cuts 
associated with disarticulation, skinning or filleting 
meat. Four fragments had been gnawed by dogs, 
eleven showed signs of weathering and there were 
six burned fragments. The number of weathered 
fragments may be proportionately greater (as is the 
small number of gnawed fragments) than the other 
species, implying slightly different disposal, but 
the evidence is very slight. Two cattle fragments 
showed the beginning of changes to the articular 
surfaces of a proximal radius and distal tibia. These 
may not be truly pathological but relate to changes 
in the joint with age.
Sheep/goat 
Sheep/goat was the least abundant of the livestock 
species by NISP (17%). 67 fragments of sheep/
goat bone were identified, as well as 64 fragments 
of sheep-sized mammal bone (although some of 
this at least may relate to pig). This material was 
contributed by a minimum number of five animals, 
with at least four adults and at least one juvenile. 
None was positively identified as sheep or goat, 
although the likelihood is that all, or nearly all, of 
the animals were sheep. Goat only occurs in very 
small numbers in contemporary assemblages, and 
the number of sites it occurs on is similarly small 
(Serjeantson 2011, 30). Three elements provided 
withers heights with a mean of 55.2cm which 
compares well with other examples of the period 
(cf Serjeantson 2011, 29). Aging data was limited, 
but one mandible provided a Grant Mandible Wear 
Stage and Payne Stage of 30 and E respectively 
(2-4 years), whilst another gave scores of 1 and A 
(0-2 months). Four loose deciduous molars were 
probably from a sub-adult animal. With seven 
porous fragments of bone (proportionately greater 
than for cattle), this indicates a spread of livestock 
age groups, including the youngest, but with no 
evidence for very old animals. The fusion data, 
with 34 elements available, also indicates a spread 
of age groups, with a large number of fused early 
and later fusing elements. There are only three 
unfused early fusing elements (in comparison to 
12 fused examples), representing animals under 10 
months of age at death. This may mean that there 
was a lesser emphasis on culling younger animals 
than is seen on the site later in prehistory (Randall

2010). Alternatively, animals were not raised near 
the site, or the site was not used during the early 
months of the animals’ life. The latter is however 
contradicted by the presence of the mandible from 
a very young animal. 
All parts of the body are represented, including 
the axial skeleton, limbs and feet, although again 
there is an under representation of the spine (Fig. 
15). There is an apparent emphasis on limb bones 
and the most well represented elements are the 
radius, tibia and the scapula, particularly the 
glenoid. These are recognised as robust elements. 
It is likely that taphonomic factors have played a 
part in producing this pattern, although selection of 
elements/body parts might be possible, as the main 
meat bearing elements are less well represented. 
The femur, humerus and innominate are less 
well represented than in cattle and may hint at 
differences in preparation for consumption and 
cooking practice. The presence of head and feet 
elements indicates that it is likely that animals were 
culled and consumed close to the point of disposal. 
Only a single example of butchery was noted on 
sheep/goat bone, utilising multiple light cuts to fillet 
or disarticulate a humerus. Potentially deliberate 
fragmentation appears to have only affected two 
sheep/goat fragments, and one sheep-sized mammal 
fragment. Only a single fragment had been gnawed, 
two weathered and seven burned. Together this may 
indicate a likely difference in approach to cooking 
the smaller sheep carcass. Sheep-sized mammal 
fragments had also been subject to gnawing and 
burning. No examples of pathological change were 
noted in sheep/goat, which may be a function of the 
small numbers, or may relate to the age profile of 
the flock, pathological change being more common 
in an older population. Like cattle, the sheep/goat 
were likely to have provided a range of primary and 
secondary products.
Pig
Pig contributed 237 fragments to this assemblage, 
by some margin the most abundant identified 
species by NISP (59%). This was contributed by a 
minimum number of seven pigs, at least five adults 
and two juveniles with most areas of the body 
well represented. Aging data was limited, but four 
mandibles provided Grant Mandible Wear Stages of 
10, 11, 13 and 25 respectively. The first three can be 
categorised broadly as 1-14 months (albeit at the old 
end of this range), and the fourth 15-26 months. A 
younger animal is attested by a mandible with unerupted M2 and M3. An older (but not old) individual 
is represented by a mandible with the second molar 
at stage m and third molar at g. A loose mandibular 
first molar and third molar were both unworn. In 
addition, a single deciduous, and six permanent 
maxillary, teeth were in wear. There were 18 porous 
fragments of pig bone, a proportionate increase 
over the less well represented cattle and sheep/goat. 
This apparently indicates a spread of age groups, 
including young animals, although the emphasis 
was on younger animals of full meat weight. The 
fusion data, with 44 elements available, had a 
distinct emphasis on younger animals. However, 
the majority of early fusing elements (under 12 
months of age) were fused (10 out of 14, compared 
to nine un-fused early fusing elements out of a total 
Fig. 15 Element frequency by MNE, sheep/goat, Early Neolithic South Cadbury Castle

SOMERSET ARCHAEOLOGY AND NATURAL HISTORY, 2017
of 30). There was a spread of un-fused elements 
through the later and latest fusing categories, whilst 
there are only two fused examples of latest fusing 
elements (>42 months). There was scant evidence 
for raising pigs on the site as the youngest ages 
are not generally present, and there are few older 
animals which could represent breeding stock. It 
is notable that this is an entirely different pattern 
than for the Later Iron Age, when evidence for the 
youngest, and much older animals was abundant 
(Randall 2010, 193). However, the only three 
canines available which indicate the sex of animals, 
all related to females. There nevertheless appears 
to be a relatively narrow representation of animals 
focussed around the prime meat age. 
All parts of the body were present, including 
the head, axial skeleton, limbs and feet (Fig. 16). 
In contrast to cattle and sheep/goat, the spine was 
represented. Meat bearing elements and limbs 
were relatively well represented. The presence of 
head and foot elements indicated that most animals 
were probably culled and consumed close to the 
point of disposal. However, there was a slightly 
lesser representation of foot elements than for other 
species. Eight examples of butchery were noted on 
pig bone, again frequently utilising multiple light 
cuts to fillet meat from the bone or disarticulate 
elements. However, only three pig fragments 
appeared to have been broken when fresh, which 
could be an under representation in comparison 
to sheep/goat. Again, this may hint at slightly 
different processing and consumption practice. 
Pig fragments had been subjected to gnawing 
(two fragments) weathering (four fragments) and 
burning (nine fragments). Slight changes were 
noted in the distal articulation of a tibia and more 
considerable ones in a proximal radius which may 
relate to joint degeneration in an older animal.
Dog
A total of six fragments of dog bone were recorded, 
all in one context, pit D660, and contributed by 
a minimum of one adult individual. All of the 
fragments were fully fused, and consisted of two 
ribs, a single cervical vertebra, a thoracic vertebra, 
a large portion of a humerus and a proximal 
articulation of a tibia. No butchery or deliberate 
fragmentation was noted and there were no 
taphonomic changes. No pathological change was 
noted. It would seem that this material may all relate 
to the remains of a single animal deposited together 
once it had become disarticulated. Skeletons or part 
skeletons as well as isolated elements of dog have 
been noted on a number of sites (Serjeantson 2011, 
31), including at Hambledon Hill (Legge 2008, 538).
Other species
Three fragments of wild species were recorded. 
A small fragment of red deer antler came from 
pit context P154B (Fig. 9B, plate). There was no 
indication of whether it had been worked or was 
from an animal which had been killed, or was shed 
antler. The distal half of a roe deer tibia, fused 
distally, occurred in context D660B. An entire left 
mandible of a fox occurred in context F589. The 
latter two were of Average-Good condition. Lack

EARLY NEOLITHIC PITS AT CADBURY CASTLE
of wild species in Early Neolithic assemblages is 
not unusual.
Red Deer (Cervus elaphus)
Having repopulated Britain at the beginning of the 
Holocene, the red deer is predominantly a woodland 
animal, which was originally widespread. They 
generally live in sex differentiated herds and shed 
antler on an annual basis (Hart-Davis 2002, 68). 
There is repeated evidence of the exploitation of red 
deer during the Neolithic across southern Britain, 
and examples are predominantly the form of antler. 
It is less clear whether this was from hunted animals 
or from shed antlers (Yalden 1999, 104). 
Roe Deer (Capreolus capreolus)
Roe deer was also a ubiquitous woodland presence 
from the beginning of the Holocene, living in 
small family groups (Hart-Davis 2002, 71-2). It 
is a repeated but generally minor inclusion in 
Neolithic assemblages (Yalden 1999, 103-4). The 
best understood example of inclusion in earlier 
Neolithic features is in the Coneybury Anomaly 
(Maltby 1990) where the roe deer was present in 
some quantity and has been suggested as replacing 
the sheep/goat ‘component’ of the assemblage, 
which is not present (Pollard 2006).
Red Fox (Vulpes vulpes)
Red fox is indigenous to Britain. It has a wide diet 
which includes small and juvenile mammals and 
birds, insects and amphibians as well as carrion. 
Its impact on livestock, apart from poultry has 
probably been historically exaggerated, but they are 
highly opportunistic (Hart-Davis 2002, 51). Small 
numbers of fox frgments occur in assemblages 
throughout later British prehistory (Yalden 1999, 
104). It is unclear if this fragment was a deliberate 
or incidental inclusion.
Discussion
Earlier Neolithic assemblages from Somerset are 
scant in both number and scale. Most Neolithic 
animal bone from Somerset comes from cave and 
swallett sites including Sun Hole and Tom Tivey’s 
Hole. At Sun Hole, Early Neolithic deposits included 
calcined animal bone (Tratman and Henderson 
1927). Tom Tivey’s Hole included human remains, 
Windmill Hill style pottery and flints as well as 
sheep bone (Barrett 1966), an indication of the 
early introduction of sheep in the area. The Early 
Neolithic levels at Charterhouse Warren Farm 
Swallett (a naturally occurring closed sinkhole) 
produced juvenile human bone, flint objects, animal 
bone and other objects, which were interpreted as 
deliberately deposited (Levitan et al. 1988). The 
habit of deposition into the Late Neolithic in these 
features is supported by the presence of grooved 
ware, human remains, flints and animal bone at 
Brimble Pit Swallett (Lewis 2005, 128). Similar 
deposits including both domestic cattle and aurochs 
occurred at Tyning’s Great Swallett (Mullan and 
Boycott 2004, 135-6), and aurochs at Charterhouse 
Warren Farm (Everton 1975).
Given the similarities of content, it should be 
considered that deposition in pits and natural 
features may be parallel practices. Early Neolithic 
pits at Chew Valley Lake produced pottery, 
flint and charred hazelnuts as well as ‘1/2 oz of 
calcined bone’ , unidentified to species (Rahtz 
and Greenfield 1977, 26-7). Other pit sites in 
Somerset and Dorset generally date from the later 
Neolithic, and either contain no animal bone or 
small quantities of a limited range of species ( e.g. 
Ben Bridge; Rahtz and Greenfield 1977:28); Abbey 
Quarry, Doulting (Higbee 2001, 2-3); Fir Tree 
Field, Down Farm, Dorset (Legg 1991, 58-65) and 
Flagstones, Dorchester (Bullock and Allen 1997, 
191). It is against this limited picture of animal 
husbandry and exploitation that the Milson’s 
Corner and Cadbury Castle assemblages should be 
considered. 
The small, highly fragmented nature of the 
material from Milsoms Corner is in many respects 
more typical of local animal bone assemblages 
of the period. Heavily burned, it only provides 
slight indication of the presence of three livestock 
species, cattle, sheep and pig. The much larger, and 
significant assemblage from the hill adds dog and 
a smattering of wild species to this list, and has 
more potential to enlighten with respect to both 
subsistence and consumption practice in the area 
in the Earlier Neolithic. The relative abundance 
of the species in the Cadbury Castle assemblage 
with pig being clearly the most abundant differs 
from other Somerset examples, and contrasts with 
contemporary assemblages further afield where 
cattle was generally more abundant; assemblages 
with a greater abundance of pig are more frequently 
noted in the later Neolithic, particularly from 
henges (Serjeantson 2011, 25). 
With little evidence for on-site breeding, 
consideration also needs to be given to whether the 
pigs were wild or domestic in origin, or a mixture of 
the two. This is potentially problematic to determine. 
Pigs were domesticated in Europe and introduced

SOMERSET ARCHAEOLOGY AND NATURAL HISTORY, 2017
to Britain at the beginning of the Neolithic along 
with sheep/goat and cattle, although inter-breeding 
may have then occurred with native boar (Albarella 
et al. 2007). Metrical data are the most useful way 
of exploring the issue, as pigs, when domesticated, 
became smaller, whilst remaining morphologically 
very similar to their wild counterparts. However, 
to complicate matters, British Mesolithic boar 
appears to have been relatively small in comparison 
to continental populations (Albarella 2010, 60). 
In this case, the metrical data are limited to a few 
measurable fragments. For example, there is only a 
single mandibular third molar available to provide 
a length. As a rule of thumb, measurements in 
excess of 40mm might be regarded as boar (Grigson 
1983), which the single example for Cadbury Castle 
(36.6mm) falls short of. Nevertheless, it compares 
well with the range for British Mesolithic wild boar 
(cf Albarella 2010; Albarella et al. 2009). It is larger 
than four examples recorded from Beaker period 
deposits at Gorsey Bigbury henge at Cheddar (Van 
Wijngaarden-Bakker 1976, 166), although the state 
of wear of these teeth was not noted. The breadth 
of the trochlea of the two Cadbury Castle humeri 
similarly fall within the British Mesolithic wild 
boar metrical distribution (cf Albarella 2010, 61). 
However, in neither case are the measurements at 
the upper end of the scale, and so could reasonably 
represent either wild or domestic pig. 
This problem is frequent as biometrical data are 
in general scant leading to a poor understanding 
of the wild populations in the Early Neolithic. By 
the later Neolithic, boar appear to have been rarely 
represented in assemblages (e.g. Durrington Walls; 
Albarella and Payne 2005), although they were 
present as attested by a large scapula and humerus 
at Mount Pleasant (Harcourt 1979, 215). The latter 
had a distal breadth of 47mm, in comparison to 
39mm for the two Cadbury Castle humeri, although 
Harcourt notes an example of 39mm in Salisbury 
Museum, listed as boar. The trochlea breadths of 
two the Cadbury Castle examples fall well within 
the range noted for, presumably domestic, pig at 
Hambledon Hill, Durrington Walls and Mount 
Pleasant (Legge 2008, 549; 572). Nine Beaker period 
examples from Mount Pleasant fall into the range 
of 30-35mm (Harcourt 1979, 217). The Cadbury 
Castle Neolithic examples are however also large in 
comparison to Middle and Late Iron Age pig teeth 
from Cadbury which occupy a range of 29-37mm 
in length (Randall 2010, 474). However, the widths 
of mandibular first molars plot at the low end of the 
range of sizes for those at Durrington Walls, where 
the majority of the assemblage was believed to be 
domestic (cf Albarella and Payne 2005, 593). It 
cannot therefore be demonstrated either way as to 
the presence or absence of wild pig. The possibility 
of interbred populations also remains. It seems 
clear that the animals did not farrow on the site, 
or at least, their remains were not incorporated 
in deposits. It seems likely that they were reared 
elsewhere and brought to the hill for consumption 
and disposal. A semi-feral style of herding might be 
suggested for their husbandry.
The rate of butchery in the Cadbury Castle 
assemblage, at 2% of total fragments, is in line 
with those noted in other Neolithic assemblages, 
although the sites from which data are available 
tend to be later in date. Often multiple short, fine, 
cuts are typical of the period (Serjeantson 2011, 
54-5). The degree to which cuts occur on different 
species appears to be highly variable, and in the 
case of the Cadbury material, the numbers are 
so small as to render any proportions potentially 
highly misleading. The percentages of burnt bone in 
Neolithic assemblages are similarly highly variable, 
so the 5% burnt material at Cadbury Castle is 
comparable with a number of sites (cf. Serjeantson 
2011, 57). The number of earlier Neolithic sites 
for which this information is available is limited, 
and where burnt material is extensive, it appears 
to occur in more ceremonial or funerary contexts. 
The accumulation of bone in a couple of particular 
features at Cadbury Castle needs to be considered 
in relation to the potential involvement of feasting. 
Most of the Early Neolithic faunal remains come 
from a number of contexts with relatively small 
amounts of bone, but three features stand out in 
having volumes of over 100 fragments. It is likely 
that these features result from specific events 
of consumption and deposition. This is further 
explored elsewhere (Tabor and Randall in prep), as 
is the very evident differences in the composition, 
treatment and deposition of the faunal remains at 
Milsoms Corner.
The botanical remains
by Dani de Carle
Although evidence of cereals in British Neolithic 
contexts is widespread, cereals tend to be 
represented by very low quantities of material at 
each site (Fairbairn 2000, Bogaard and Jones 2007, 
Jones and Rowley-Conwy 2007) with a few notable 
exceptions, such as Hambledon Hill, Dorset (Jones 
and Legge 2008), Windmill Hill, Wiltshire (Whittle 
et al. 2000) and, further north, Lismore Fields,

Derbyshire (Jones in press). The plant remains 
from the Early Neolithic pit contexts at Milsoms 
Corner are mostly seeds of crop weeds and other 
wild species. 
A total of 135 litres of soil were processed from 
the ten samples selected for study. Hazel nutshell 
was abundant but only 28 identifiable seed or 
chaff items were recorded, including one poorly 
preserved barley grain, two indeterminate cereal 
grains, a single glume wheat glume base and a flax 
seed (Table 16). The few seeds of potential crop 
weeds include Stellaria cf. media, Vicia/Lathyrus 
sp. and seeds of Polygonaceae. However, thousands 
of hazel nutshell fragments were recovered from 
the samples, particularly MC1889 and MC1839, 
for which the shell recovered from the flot was 
weighed rather than counted; further material 
would probably be recoverable from the heavy 
residues.
The pre-depositional taphonomy of cereals is 
very different to that of nutshell. Jones (2000) 
points out that the nutshell represents the waste 
from consumption rather than the product which 
would normally be consumed. The equivalent waste 
parts for cereals are chaff and straw. Nutshell also 
has little value beyond its use as kindling or fuel 
whereas chaff and straw may have other uses such 
as fodder and building materials. What is more, 
the dense nutshell survives charring relatively well 
while lighter material such as chaff and straw tend 
to survive poorly (Boardman and Jones 1990). 
There is a suggestion that hazel nutshells within 
pits could be suggestive of processing of hazelnuts 
by roasting (Score and Mithen 2000, Mithen et al. 
2001), although the Milsoms Corner pits do not 
match the shape and dimensions of the previously 
identified Mesolithic examples and the deposits 
are much smaller. The Milsoms Corner samples 
are from pits in the wider landscape rather than 
unambiguously settlement-based contexts. The 
evidence of relatively rapid intentional filling 
of the pits is indicated by minimal weathering 
and the inclusion of artifacts such as ‘elegant’ 
pottery associated with sites across the south 
west, a Cornish polished axe, a complete and 
fragmentary quern stones from the Mendips and 
rubbers (Tabor 2008a, 45). These assemblages are 
similar to those across Neolithic southern Britain 
where gathered food remains outnumber those of 
cultivated crops (Robinson 2000) and point towards 
ceremonial actions. Cereal-based assemblages are 
perhaps more likely to be associated with areas 
of settlement, particularly houses. These types of 
context are well represented at continental Neolithic 
sites, and in later periods in the SCEP landscape 
itself. Unfortunately the lack of archaeobotanical 
sampling during the hillfort excavations means that 
no material is available from the possible gully and 
post-built rectangular buildings found on the South 
Cadbury hilltop. To date, all that can be said about 
the Early Neolithic crops is that barley and glume 
wheat, probably emmer (Greig 1991; Campbell 
and Straker 2003), were available in the SCEP 
landscape, and that wild resources seem to have 
played a significant role compared to later periods, 
especially the Iron Age.
Wood charcoal results from Neolithic Hambledon 
Hill (Austin et al. 2008, 461) indicated a greater 
diversity in the wood species than that recorded for 
later periods. The Early Neolithic SCEP samples 
show relatively low diversity compared to samples 
from the following periods (Table 17). The more 
numerous species represented are deciduous 
Quercus, Corlyus and Corylus/Alnus, Pomoideae 
and Prunus spp. The presence of possible scrub 
or wooodland edge taxa as well as understory

species suggests clearings. However, it is unclear 
how much this slightly restricted range of species 
results from the samples all coming from tightly 
clustered contexts of the same type in what may 
have been a tree rich environment. Other periods 
are represented by a range of context types widely 
spaced across sites on a range of substrates. In the 
later periods people may have had less choice of 
wood in their immediate surroundings and so had 
to collect from a wider range of habitats, while 
Neolithic samples might represent taxa that were 
immediately to hand without the need to travel 
further or use other taxa.

EARLY NEOLITHIC PITS AT CADBURY CASTLE
and postholes neighbouring hearth D654 and pit 
D660 may have supported structural frameworks 
but the dating of possible wall trenches on site K 
is far from convincing. On the other hand there is 
good evidence that the hollow on the north side 
of Milsoms Corner spur represents a base for 
a shelter. The claim rests on the preparation of a 
floor surface, the hearth pit 293, the thin scatter of 
charcoal across the floor to its south, and a group 
of stakeholes. A gully and other possible small cut 
features extending from west to south of the pit are 
presumed to be associated with them (Fig. 3A). The 
dearth of finds from the floor and hearth suggest 
that the surface was kept clean in contrast to the 
sealing layers and the fills of the other pits. Since 
much of the floor and, probably, further cut features 
were not exposed, it would be spurious to attempt 
a detailed reconstruction of a structure. In general 
terms it would have been lightweight but given 
the effort in digging a terrace it is likely to have 
been more than a tent. The cuts into the floor are 
almost certainly closely contemporary with each 
other, apparently ruling out a tepee-like covering, 
although they might arise from reinstatement of a 
shelter over a succession of visits.
There is evidence for a characteristic structural 
sequence during the Early Neolithic in which 
substantial timber longhouses give way to smaller 
structures, some still rectangular, after the first 
quarter of the 4th millennium BC (Last 2013, 274-
5). It has been suggested that a few generations 
after the building and demise of a large rectangular 
structure at Kingsmead Quarry, Horton, Berkshire, 
pits in a rectangular arrangement around a 5m by 
6m ‘empty’ space respected a structure which has 
left no other traces (Chaffey and Brook 2012, 205-
8; fig. 14.5). A few of the pit clusters at Kilverstone, 
Norfolk, have a similar pattern (Garrow et al. 2005, 
14-20) but it was considered unlikely that they 
surrounded a structure as the 2.25m maximum 
dimension of available space would be very 
restrictive (Garrow et al. 2005, 76).
Identification of lightweight structures has 
proved problematic. An up to 0.50m deep Mesolithic 
sunken floor including a sequence of hearths at 
Howick, Northumberland, appeared to have been 
post and stake built over three phases during the 
first quarter of the 8th millennium BC (Waddington 
2003, 3-5). The hollow was approximately 6m in 
diameter. A gully along its southern boundary is 
comparable in form to 542, the gully cutting the 
Milsoms Corner floor. A distinct sandy floor level 
formed the base of the latest of three successive, 
stake built, roughly oval, structures at Cowie, 
Stirlingshire. The orientation of the ovals was 
described as East to West although the plans shows 
it as south west to north east. The stake holes were 
set within continuous fence slots lacking evidence 
for entrances. The structures ranged in size from 
3.7m by 2.1m to 4.7m by 2.9m. The latest of the 
structures post-dated the first quarter of the 4th
millennium. It was assumed that they were broadly 
contemporary with a nearby line of three pits, 
two of which included good assemblages of early

SOMERSET ARCHAEOLOGY AND NATURAL HISTORY, 2017
Neolithic pottery and produced radiocarbon dates 
centred on the middle quarters of the 4th millennium 
BC (Atkinson 2002, 144-5, illus. 5; 182-3).
In Cornwall substantial structures have been 
proposed at Helman Tor and, more persuasively, at 
Carn Brea (Mercer 1997, 16-21; 1981, 23-7) but a 
much lighter structure was posited at St Keverne. 
A short segment of a curving gully and depressions 
within it were interpreted as a bedding trench for 
a south to north oriented ‘tent-like structure’ with 
approximate dimensions of 4m by 2.5m. A line of 
stones continuing northwards from the west side of 
the gully would have weighed down the fabric of 
the ‘tent’ (Smith and Harris 1982, 30-1; fig. 6). Of 
the several sherds of pottery from the upper fills 
of three nearby pits one was diagnostically Early 
Neolithic (Smith and Harris 1982, fig. 18, 83).
The scale of a shelter covering most of the floor 
at Milsoms Corner would be comparable with the 
examples at Cowie and St. Keverne but the only 
other similarity is in the use of stake supports which 
it shares with Cowie. By its nature evidence for 
stake-built structures survives only where ground 
conditions are suitable and where the manner of 
excavation allows its identification. The latter is 
an especially acute problem due to the extensive 
deep stripping applied routinely in development-led 
archaeology.
CONCLUSION
The environmental evidence suggests the local Early 
Neolithic human population on, and presumably 
around South Cadbury Castle, maintained herds 
of domesticated cattle and sheep/goats and a small 
number of dogs. Pigs contributing to the diet may 
have been only semi-domesticated and it is likely 
that although cereals were circulating locally wild 
plants, and probably animals, remained important 
sources of nutrition. Evidence from three of the 
hilltop pits implies that there were episodes of high 
meat consumption, possibly feasting. One of the 
three was associated with human bone and another, 
D660, was close to a hearth and other features 
which may have been associated an encampment 
or dwelling. There is no obvious patterning in 
association with other finds but it is possible that 
the deposition of human bone and feasting linked 
to particular pits were events outside the normal 
daily routine. However, the hilltop pits cannot be 
related meaningfully to each other because of their 
imprecise dating.
In contrast the Milsoms Corner pits are 
likely to result from a single or a few closely set 
episodes of occupation. The pits were either open 
simultaneously or their traces remained as did the 
memories of the group of people associated with 
them. The evidence is enough to produce an outline 
narrative of events. A level terrace was excavated 
over which a lightweight shelter was erected. Fire in 
a pit under the shelter provided heat and light whilst 
outside a fire in another pit was used for cooking 
and possibly industrial processes associated with 
heat. These may have included the baking or drying 
of hazelnuts but it is possible that the nutshells were 
treated as fuel after the consumption of raw kernels. 
A wind break was constructed where a quern 
was used to produce nut or possibly cereal flour, 
although the evidence for the latter is tenuous. One 
or more used up querns had a secondary use after 
crushing as an additive to clay for potting. The clay 
may have been mixed in one of the pits. Most of 
the bone was so severely burnt that it is unlikely to 
be a byproduct of cooking but its properties with 
respect to exposure to high temperatures may have 
been exploited in the process of firing pottery. 
At least two of the pits then had a secondary use 
for the disposal of the accumulated byproducts 
of occupation. On occasions some of the deposits 
were dug into not long after they had been laid, 
occasionally to receive small meaningful deposits 
in the two larger pits. Towards the end of the 
occupation a complete quern was placed in a pit 
adjacent to the area where it was used, possibly with 
a view to being used again on a subsequent visit. A 
rubber may have been placed in the neighbouring 
hearth which had been used throughout the 
occupation. The remaining detritus was deposited 
in the two larger pits and the inhabitants moved 
on. Natural processes began to fill the remaining 
hollows and to degrade any remaining surface 
pottery.
