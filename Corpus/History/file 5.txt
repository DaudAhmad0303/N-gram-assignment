Story highlights
For the first time , a surgical hole has been found in a Stone Age animal skull
This was either made to help the animal , or an experiment before attempting surgery on a human 
( CNN ) Humans have been performing cranial surgery and drilling holes in other people ' s skulls for a long time . The oldest example of this procedure , called trepanation , dates to 7 , 300 B . C .  , according to findings from a site at the village of Vasilyevka in Azerbaijan . That means cranial surgery was happening as long ago as the Mesolithic period . 

Now , for the first time , a definite example of cranial surgery has been found in an animal : specifically , a nearly complete cow ' s skull discovered at a Neolithic site that dates to 3 , 400 to 3 , 000 BC . The investigation of this skull is detailed in a study published Thursday in the journal Scientific Reports . 
Trepanation has been found in skulls from all over the world and usually involved drilling , cutting or scraping layers of bone to form a hole . These techniques were used to avoid being forceful and cause further damage or fracturing to the skull . As early as the Neolithic period , symptoms such as seizures , epilepsy , headaches and alterations in behavior were associated with the brain , which is why the holes are usually found in similar locations . 
The cow ' s skull was found at the Stone Age site of Champ-Durand in France , just under 25 miles from the Atlantic coast . The settlement was once an important trade center , specializing in salt production as well as cattle . Archaeological excavations were carried out there from 1975 to 1985 , and bones of cows , pigs , sheep and goats have been found . 
Cows have been a popular find in other Neolithic sites , and their bones make up about 54% of the uncovered animal remains .

But complete craniums are a rare find ; these animals were raised as food , and their skulls were usually broken to retrieve the tongue and brain , the study said . A wild boar skull previously found in Roquefort , France , possibly from the Neolithic period , showed signs of what could be considered surgery . But the only study of the skull was published in 1948 , and the skull was never dated . 
After the cow ' s skull was uncovered at Champ-Durand , a 1999 study suggested that the hole in the cranium was the result of the cow being gored by another cow . The lead director of the archaeological excavation asked Fernando Ramirez Rozzi , a paleontologist with the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique , to study the skull . 
Rozzi and his biological anthropologist colleague Alain Froment at the Musee de l ' Homme in Paris studied the hole in the skull . They determined that there were no fractures or other evidence of an injury or blow , like goring . There is also no sign of healing around the bone tissue , which means the cow either didn ' t survive the trepanation process or died shortly after . The other possibility is that it was dead when the hole was formed .

But the researchers , familiar with the scraping and cut marks associated with trepanation , determined that the bone had been scraped intensively -- with the intent to form a hole in the cranium . In other words , this was not accidental .  
 " The main surprise was to see so evident the scratching on the cow skull reveal trepanation , the scraping marks are exactly similar in the human and cow skull " when compared to human trepanation examples , Rozzi wrote in an email .

The biggest lingering question for the researchers is why the hole was made in the first place . If this was a surgical intervention to help and save the life of the cow , it could be considered the oldest evidence of a veterinarian act . But given that cows were such a popular source of food and that the people lived off the livestock they raised , it ' s difficult for the researchers to see the reasoning behind surgical intervention .  
 " What would be the interest to heal a cow which represent the most abundant animal among the archaeological remains ?  " Rozzi asked . 
Another likely scenario is that humans practiced surgical experimentation on animals before trying it on each other . Examples of trepanation in humans have surprised researchers by how perfect and precisely they were carried out , especially in instances in which the patients survived . That kind of skill and technique could be achieved only through practice . And even though we may never know the real reasons and intent behind trepanation found in the archaeological record , it shows us what our ancestors were capable of doing .  
 " These two possibilities reveal new insights for the Neolithic society ,  " Rozzi said .
