The Plutonium is not the only example of an ancient site centered around noxious fumes . Ancient literature suggests that at the Palace of Apollo in Delphi , Greece -- where the oracle once prophesied the future -- people would enter a trance after inhaling noxious fumes . Modern research puts this down to a mixture of carbon dioxide and methane coming from an earth fissure .

Scientists believe they have figured out the mystery behind a Greco-Roman temple where animals were reported to drop dead as part of a ritual sacrifice . Known as the & quot ; Plutonium ,  & quot ; the temple consisted of a stone doorway that led to a cave-like grotto , established around 190 BC . A team of Italian archaeologists rediscovered the cave in 2013 -- this is their 3D virtual reconstruction of the site .

Story highlights
A grotto in Turkey was once believed to be the gateway to hell
Animals mysteriously died at its entrance
Two thousand years later scientific research reveals the reason 
( CNN ) Two thousand years ago , ancient tourists flocked to a Greco-Roman temple in Hierapolis , modern-day Turkey , situated on top of a cave once purported to be the gateway to the underworld . 

They watched in awe as animals , from birds to bulls , dropped dead at its entrance . The cave , named the " Plutonium " after Pluto , god of the underworld , was thought to belch the " breath of death ,  " killing all those in its reach , except the divinely immune priests who led the animals to sacrifice . 
Roman author and natural historian Pliny the Elder described the phenomenon as the " sewer of Charon " -- the mythical ferryman who rowed souls across the River Styx and Acheron and into the depths of the underworld . 
Toxic gas
But scientists have now provided an explanation for the mystery , and it ' s not supernatural . Research published by the journal of Archaeological and Anthropological Sciences in February shows that a fissure in the earth ' s surface , deep beneath the site , emits carbon dioxide at concentrations so high it can be deadly . 
Using a portable gas analyzer , Hardy Pfanz and his team of volcanologists found CO2 at levels ranging from 4-53% at the mouth of the cave , and as high as 91% inside -- more than enough to kill living organisms . 
Entrance to the Plutonium 
Entrance to the Plutonium 
 " Problems for mammals ( including humans ) start way below 5% CO2 ,  " Pfanz told CNN .  " A longer stay at 7% and more leads to sweating , dizziness , tachycardia ( elevated heart rate ) etc . A further increase would lead to asphyxiation due to the lack of oxygen and due to acidification of the blood and the body or brain cells .  " 
So it ' s no wonder the animals that entered the cave came to a swift end . During the research period alone , Pfanz says they found several dead birds , mice and more than 70 dead beetles . 
Other monuments from the ancient city on the banks of the Tigris will also be moved according to CNN Turk , including tombs , mosques and minarets . Hasankeyf has a 12 , 000-year history and contains many neolithic caves .

Tourist attraction
It was no different in ancient times , when people traveled to Hierapolis to see the phenomenon . The city , founded around 190 BC , was famous for the Plutonium as well as its hot springs , which still attract thousands of tourists today . Francesco D ' Andria , the Italian archaeologist who rediscovered the site in 2013 , says that they found evidence of a theater around the Plutonium that could have been for spectators .

The Greek geographer Strabo , who lived from around 64 BC to 21 AD , described the spectacle :  " Any animal that passes inside meets instant death . At any rate , bulls that are led into it fall and are dragged out dead ; and I threw in sparrows and they immediately breathed their last and fell ,  " he wrote . 
Strabo recognized this reaction was related to the emission of gas -- " the space is full of a vapor so misty and dense that one can scarcely see the ground " -- but he puzzled over how it affected the animals but not the priests , asking whether it was because of their divine providence or simply because they held their breath .

Pfanz ' s research adds another possibility : the fact that the animals and priests are different heights . CO2 is a heavier than oxygen , therefore it settles lower , forming a toxic gas lake above the ground .  " The nostrils of the animals were way in the gas lake ,  " he says , whereas the priests stood taller , above the gas lake . 
Pfanz believes the priests were aware of the gas and knew that its concentration fluctuated depending on the time of day . Recent research , which took measurements over a period of time , found that the CO2 level was particularly high at dawn and dusk , as sunlight disperses the gas . 
But D ' Andria disputes this , citing a number of oil lamps found in front of the grotto .  " It was highly probable that many ritual activities were developed during the night ,  " he says .
