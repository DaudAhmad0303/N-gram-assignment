INTRODUCTION
The intellectual foundations of contemporary landscape approaches in archaeology may be traced back to at least the 1920s ( Stoddard and Zubrow , 1999 , 
p . 686 ; discussed later )  . Despite their historical depth in the discipline ’ s development , until recently landscape approaches largely were subsumed within archaeological inquiry to provide a backdrop against which material traces were plotted
and evaluated ( Knapp and Ashmore , 1999 )  . Now , as evident from a review of the

archaeologists increasingly are using the term landscape in the forefront of reporting their studies . Nevertheless , no commonly accepted understanding of what
landscape studies are or should be exists . For example , authors use a multiplicity
of landscape references that differentially emphasize natural ( e . g .  , ecological , geomorphological , and hydrological ) and cultural ( e . g .  , technological , organizational , 
and cosmological ) aspects of the human environment . 
The wide variability among archaeological uses of landscape at first glance
raises the question whether the word retains noteworthy meaning in archaeological
practice . That is , haslandscape simply become a synonym for natural environment
orsettlement pattern ( e . g .  , see discussion by Whittlesey , 1997 , p . 19 )  ? Researchers
expecting a singular landscape concept might construe the terminological imprecision and the multiplicity of approaches as symptomatic of a lack of clear theoretical
grounding . 
Archaeology is not alone in confronting the challenges posed by terminological and conceptual differences among varied landscape approaches . Fundamental
intellectual tensions inherent within landscape concepts among Western social sciences today generally are traceable to the late nineteenth century debates led by
Friederich Ratzel and Emile Durkheim ( Hirsch , 1995 )  . Both investigators viewed
society from organismic perspectives . 
Ratzel , a geographer , focused on how human groups extended themselves
across space and differentiated themselves from one another in relationship to
properties imposed by their natural environments ( Buttimer , 1971 , p . 28 ; Gregory , 
1994a , p . 18 )  . For Durkheim , who viewed society as the outcome of collective
consciousness shaped by institutional frameworks , human relationships with their
natural habitats are of indirect concern ( Buttimer , 1971 , p . 28 )  . Given these intellectual traditions , it is not surprising that landscape concepts in geography and
other social sciences have a multiplicity of meanings that fall variously along the
nature–culture continuum ( e . g .  , see Cosgrove , 1985 ; Hart , 1995 ; Jackson , 1984 ; 
Roberts , 1987 ; Stilgoe , 1982 ; Thompson , 1995b )  . 
The abundance of terminologies and approaches that raises concerns over
the usefulness of landscape concepts in archaeology is not simply the result of
inappropriate borrowing of a singular well-developed idea from another discipline . 
At issue today , just as it has been for more than a century , is the fundamental nature
of the relationship ( s ) between people and the spaces they occupy . 
We view the rapid growth in the use of landscape concepts over the past
decade as symptomatic of significant change in popular archaeological thinking
about landscapes . Knapp and Ashmore characterize this difference as “ that what
was once theorized as a passive backdrop or forcible determinant of culture is
now seen as an active and far more complex entity in relation to human lives ”  
( 1999 , p . 2 )  . Within this ongoing examination of the relationships between nature
and culture in how communities transform physical spaces into meaningful places 
( Hirsch , 1995 ; Tuan , 1977 ; discussed later )  , the landscape approaches presented in

recent compendiums ( e . g .  , Ashmore and Knapp , 1999 ; Bender , 1993a ; Crumley
and Marquardt , 1987 ; Carmichael et al .  , 1994 ; Feld and Basso , 1996a ; Fisher
and Thurston , 1999a ; Hirsch and O ’ Hanlon , 1995 ; Thompson , 1995a ; Ucko and
Layton , 1999 ) establish frameworks for building a more synthetic archaeology of 
 “ place .  ” 
As Fisher and Thurston ( 1999b , p . 631 ) observe , some of the most highly
productive landscape research draws from complementary theoretical perspectives . Landscape approaches allow researchers to accommodate , if not integrate , 
different theoretical perspectives even while these constructs exist in tension with
one another . Through this characteristic , an explicitly defined landscape approach
might facilitate bridging the divide between processual and postprocessual archaeologies . 
The purpose of this review is to examine the attraction that landscape concepts
currently have among archaeologists . To complete this task , we consider two basic
questions : What are landscapes ? And how are landscape approaches relevant to
building a fuller understanding of cultural and historical processes in archaeology ? 
For organizational purposes , our discussion has five sections . The first introduces a landscape paradigm and its underlying premises . In turn , these principles
provide the foundations for assessing a landscape approach ’ s usefulness in archaeological study . We suggest that a landscape approach is relevant to archaeology ’ s
goal to explain humanity ’ s past through its ability to facilitate the recognition and
evaluation of the dynamic , interdependent relationships that people maintain with
the physical , social , and cultural dimensions of their environments across space
and over time . A landscape approach also is relevant for its capacity to bridge
the division between archaeological practice and the concerns of archaeology ’ s
many publics , including the people of indigenous communities who increasingly
are vocal participants in discussions on the interpretation and management of their
heritage . 
In the second section , we review the ontogeny of landscape concepts over
their history in the social sciences , including geography , cultural anthropology , and
archaeology . Our intention is to show that the centrality of landscape ’ s cultural context is both a material record of patterned behaviors within specific environmental
contexts and a symbolic construction ( after Olwig , 1996 )  . 
In the third section , we examine the historical compatibility between landscape concepts and common archaeological practice . That is to say , archaeologists , 
implicitly and informally , historically incorporate aspects of a landscape approach
in their studies . We suggest that archaeology is well suited for applying an integrative landscape paradigm more explicitly and productively than are other social
sciences , including geography , by virtue of its combined anthropological perspective and time depth . 
The fourth section explores several of the elements and applications of landscape ideas in current literature that will contribute toward the definition of a

broadly encompassing landscape paradigm . Each of three approaches discussed—
settlement ecology , ritual landscapes , and ethnic landscapes—emphasize different
aspects of how humans define , shape , and use space . 
In the final section , we consider the role of a landscape approach in current
archaeological research directions and trends . Through the development of a coherent anthropology of place , archaeology appears well positioned to contribute to
building a landscape paradigm and the development of appropriate methodologies
for its application . The approach also facilitates dialogue between archaeologists
and traditional communities . 
A LANDSCAPE PARADIGM AND ITS USEFULNESS
IN ARCHAEOLOGY
A paradigm is a set of working assumptions , procedures , and findings that
define a pattern of inquiry about the nature of our knowledge of the world or
some aspect of the world ( see Clark , 1993 ; Masterman , 1970 ; cf . Kuhn , 1970 )  . A
landscape paradigm for archaeological use , however , corresponds to the realm of a
base construct paradigm rather than the overarching metaphysic paradigm by Kuhn 
( 1970 ) or the intermediate-level sociological paradigm ( Masterman , 1970 , p . 65 )  . 
While metaphysical paradigms generally consist of a way of seeing that organizes
perception to affirm or assert the content of a scientific discipline ( Masterman , 
1970 , pp . 65 , 68–76 )  , sociological paradigms refer to concrete scientific achievements accepted by divergent communities ( Masterman , 1970 , pp . 66–68 )  . Construct paradigms , in comparison , are methodological in that they are systems of
strategies and tools for approaching particular kinds of scientific inquiry as well as
interpreting what they do ( Masterman , 1970 , p . 70 )  . In this capacity , a landscape
paradigm “ is defined more by what it doesthan what it is ”  ( Whittlesey , 1997 , p . 20 , 
emphasis in original ; see also Masterman , 1970 , p . 70 )  . 
Four interrelated premises provide the principal foundations for a landscape
paradigm : 
1 . Landscapes are not synonymous with natural environments . Landscapes
are synthetic ( Jackson , 1984 , p . 156 )  , with cultural systems structuring and
organizing peoples ’ interactions with their natural environments ( Deetz , 
1990 ; see also Ingold , 1993 , p . 152 ; Tuan , 1977 , passim ; Thompson , 
1995b , p . xi ; Zube , 1994 , p .  ‘ 1 )  . As Cosgrove notes ,  “ landscape denotes
the external world mediated through subjective human experience ”  ( 1985 , 
p . 13 )  . Knapp and Ashmore add that by mediating between nature and culture , landscapes are ” an integral part of Bourdieu ’ s habitus ”  ( 1999 , p . 20 , 
emphasis in original )  . 
2 . Landscapes are worlds of cultural product ( after Boone , 1994 , p . 7 ; see
also Norton , 1989 ; Thompson , 1995b ; Tuan , 1977 ; Wagner , 1995 , p . 5 )  .

Archaeology of Landscapes 161
Through their daily activities , beliefs , and values , communities transform
physical spaces into meaningful places . Ta¸con notes ,  “ Experience , history , 
value systems , relationships , circumstance , and individual choices all play
a part in how landscapes are .  .  . described ”  ( 1999 , p . 34 )  . Accordingly , a 
 “ landscape is not merely the world we see , it is a construction , a composition of that world ”  ( Cosgrove , 1985 , p . 13 )  . Thus landscapes are not the
same as “ built environments ,  ” which refer to designed physical constructions ( after Domosh , 1995 , pp . 48–49 ; Foote , 1995 , pp . 294–295 )  . Landscapes represent “ a way in which .  .  . people have signified themselves and
their world through their .  .  . relationship with nature , and through which
they have underlined and communicated their own social role and that of
others with respect to external nature ”  ( Cosgrove , 1985 , p . 15 )  . 
3 . Landscapes are the arena for all of a community ’ s activities . Thus landscapes not only are constructs of human populations but they also are the
milieu in which those populations survive and sustain themselves . A landscape ’ s domain involves patterning in both within-place and between-place
contexts ( Binford , 1982 , p . 5 ; Deetz , 1990 , p . 2 ; see also Hubert , 1994 )  . 
Observable patterns of both material traces and empty spaces come from
interactions between culturally organized dimensions and nonculturally
organized resources and life-space distributions ( Binford , 1983 , p . 380 )  . 
With landscapes organizing perception and action , economy , society , and
ideation are not only interconnected but they also are interdependent ( see
Anschuetz , 1998 )  . 
4 . Landscapes are dynamic constructions , with each community and each
generation imposing its own cognitive map on an anthropogenic world of
interconnected morphology , arrangement , and coherent meaning 
( Anschuetz and Scheick , 1998 , p . 6 ; Jackson , 1984 , p . 156 ; see also
Hoskins , 1955 ; Parcero Oubi˜na et al .  , 1998 , p . 174 )  . Because landscapes
embody fundamental organizing principles for the form and structure of
peoples ’ activities , they serve both as a material construct that communicates information and as a kind of historical text ( Hugill and Foote , 1995 , 
p . 20 )  . Moreover , the landscape , as a system for manipulating meaningful
symbols in human actions and their material by-products , helps define
customary patterned relationships among varied information . Processes
of behavioral change across space and over time necessarily result in an
ever-changing landscape , however . Thus landscape is a cultural process 
( Hirsch , 1995 ; contra Cosgrove , 1984 , p . 32 )  . 
A landscape paradigm is relevant in archaeological inquiry given its potential to contribute toward resolution of several crucial problems confronting
the discipline today . First , archaeologists long ago recognized the need to shift
from the investigation of single sites to the study of questions addressing regional change and variation ( e . g .  , Binford , 1982 , 1983 ; Deetz , 1990 ; Fish and
P1 : GFU / GDB / GDX / LMD / GCX P2 : GCR

162 Anschuetz , Wilshusen , and Scheick
Kowalewski , 1990 ; Struever , 1971 , to name only a few )  . Various nonsite , offsite , and archaeological landscape approaches ( e . g .  , Cherry et al .  , 1991 ; Dunnell , 
1992 ; Ebert , 1992 ; Rossignol and Wandsnider , 1992 ; Yamin and Metheny , 1996 ; 
see also the later discussions ) arose to consider the distribution and range of archaeological residues that do not conform either spatially or conceptually with
commonly recognized site types . As a discipline , archaeology characteristically
has lacked a concept of sufficient breadth and depth to implement this shift fully , 
however . Renfrew ( 1982 ) argues the cognitive background of communities is as
important to archaeologists as is the understanding of the physical environment . 
Darvill ( 1997 , p . 168 ) suggests the idea of the archaeological site might continue
to represent the single greatest impediment to interpretive thinking because the
scenes and edges of archaeological investigations can become confused with patterns of past activities that played out in differently defined arenas . As we have
discussed later , a landscape approach provides cultural–historical frameworks to
evaluate and interpret diverse observations about spatial and temporal variability
in the structure and organization of material traces . Open to empirical observation
and objective evaluation , a landscape approach provides guidelines whereby multiple investigators pursuing different research topics can contribute collectively to
a more comprehensive understanding of past patterns of adaptation and culture
change . 
Second , as epitomized by the postprocessual critique over the past two
decades , dissatisfaction exists for many current archaeological explanations of
variability in past human behavior ( Bradley , 1993a ; Earle and Preucel , 1987 ; 
Knapp , 1996 ; Preucel , 1990 ; Trigger , 1986 ; Wylie , 1993a )  . Archaeologists unquestionably have made significant contributions in evaluating the structure and
organization of technologies , in documenting physical environmental trends , and
in refining dating methods . Unfortunately , the narrowness of our many existing
explanatory constructs limits understanding of the creative role of human agency
in defining and in altering their own conditions for living . Critics ( e . g .  , Thomas , 
1993 ) argue that , in processual examinations of archaeological traces across space , 
researchers tend to award material evidence a status that is more “ real ” than the society that produced it . Individuals only are known teleologically through their surviving works , while the dynamic social context that interconnects and imbues significance upon archaeological remains is missing ( Thomas , 1993 , p . 26 )  . We believe
that a landscape approach offers strategies and tools that will enable researchers to
fulfill calls for constructions of the past populated with ideational actors ( Cowgill , 
1993 ; Trigger , 1991 ; Watson , 1995 ) rather than “ faceless blobs ”  ( Tringham , 1991 ) 
that simply responded to whatever natural environmental vagaries befell them . A
landscape approach also provides a framework for considering “ peoples ’ histories ,  ” which contribute to the variation observed in the archaeological record ( after
Trigger , 1991 , p . 554 )  . In the process of examining the complex interrelationships
that people maintain with their environments , a landscape approach might help

Archaeology of Landscapes 163
bridge the chasm between scientific and humanistic perspectives in archaeology 
( Lekson , 1996 )  . 
Third , a landscape approach is relevant to how archaeologists present their
discipline publicly in general and to how they interact with indigenous peoples in particular . In his Distinguished Lecture in Archaeology for the American
Anthropological Association , Sabloff ( 1998 , p . 869 ) criticizes the discipline for its
failure to serve the public ’ s interest in a productive and responsible fashion on a
broader scale . Because landscapes communicate information on how communities
interacted with their environments over time , they serve as a medium for meaningful cross-cultural dialogue on the construction and reproduction of affiliations
with places . By providing a framework that legitimizes communities ’ customary understandings of affiliation and a context for understanding the importance
of relationships in sustaining community traditions , foundations for respecting
cultural differences in issues of land tenure claims , resource uses , and heritage
sites are broadened . Through active participation in landscape studies , indigenous
peoples both contribute in compiling information important to their communities
and building an appreciation of how archaeological investigations serve their interests ( Anschuetz and Scheick , 1999 )  . In turn , a landscape approach facilitates
the exchange of insights , which archaeologists then can use either to build upon
existing scientific arguments or design new kinds of research about past peoples ’ 
interactions with their environments ( e . g .  , Hena and Anschuetz , 2000 )  . By engaging people from traditional communities as respected partners , and whose way
of knowing past landscapes can enhance scientific understandings , archaeologists
ensure the relevance of their discipline to a community that is greater than themselves ( Echo-Hawk , 2000 )  . 
Because landscape is a synthetic abstraction , it provides a unifying concept
for contrasting perspectives ( after Crumley and Marquardt , 1990 )  . The construct ’ s
usefulness in helping structure assessments of people ’ s complexly woven interactions with their environments across space and over time lies in its ability “ to bring
together a disparate group of loosely related approaches under a single heading ”  
( Preucel , 1998 , p . 1 ; see also Gosden and Head , 1994 , p . 113 ; Zube , 1994 )  . As
such , a landscape paradigm has the potential to facilitate identification of “ the pattern which connects ”  ( after Bateson , 1978 ) disparate observations on the breadth
of communities ’ interactions with their environments . Bateson ( 1978 ) defines the
pattern which connects as a metapattern of interacting and interdependent parts . 
Bateson maintains further that the elements cannot be understood by what they
supposedly are in and of themselves . Instead , they are understood in terms of what
they do in relation to one another within recursive processes . 
Given our earlier comments on problems associated with terminological imprecision , we recognize a need to define parameters upon which researchers will
continue to build and refine a landscape paradigm . Nevertheless , we anticipate that
objective demonstration of the usefulness of a landscape approach as a processual ,

interactive , contextual , and interdisciplinary framework for identifying patterns , 
explicating data , and explaining behavior nearly is at hand . In particular , we believe
that a landscape approach helps contribute to the building of fuller understandings of relationships among the varied spatial , temporal , ecological , and cognitive
contexts in which people creatively interact with their environments . 
DEVELOPMENT OF LANDSCAPE CONCEPTS
Investigators outside anthropology and archaeology initially defined the landscape concept for use in the social sciences . The intellectual framework for this
definition derives from the debate between Ratzel and Durkheim ( Hirsch , 1995 )  . 
Neither researcher referred to the landscape concept explicitly , however . The first
formal landscape definition comes from Carl Sauer ’ s work in geography . Although
it is more than 75 years old , the definition given by Sauer ( 1925 , p . 46 ) remains
current for archaeology in cogent ways . 
The cultural landscape is fashioned from a natural landscape by a culture group . Culture
is the agent , the natural area is the medium , the cultural landscape is the result . Under
the influence of a given culture , itself changing through time , the landscape undergoes
development , passing through phases , and probably reaching ultimately the end of its cycle
of development . With the introduction of a different—that is , alien—culture , a rejuvenation
of the cultural landscape sets in , or a new landscape is superimposed on the remnants of an
older one . 
As a counter to the influence of Ratzel ’ s environmental determinism that pervaded the early twentieth century , Sauer ’ s definition stands as a hallmark because
he acknowledged the contributing role of institutional frameworks in shaping society . In his work , Sauer specifically “ sought to stress the agency of culture as a
force in shaping the visible features of delimited regions on the Earth ’ s surface ”  
( Cosgrove , 1994 , p . 115 )  . A deliberate empiricist who was intellectually close
to anthropology colleagues Kroeber and Lowie at Berkeley , Sauer emphasized
visible elements of physical environments that evoke human management and
modification , such as water courses , plants , and animals . For Sauer , culture was 
 “ the impress of the works of man upon the area ”  ( 1925 , p . 38 )  , and he cited three
basic factors to the study of landscape :  “ the physical environment , the character
of the people , and time ”  ( in Norton , 1989 , p . 37 )  . He played down landscape ’ s
subjective aspects “ and stresses that landscape was an objective area to be studied
scientifically through observation ”  ( Duncan , 1994 , p . 316 )  . 
In the 1960s and 1970s , geographers split along two contrasting trajectories
in their approaches to the discipline . The first is an explicitly positivist science
emphasizing spatial quantitative approaches in the documentation and evaluation
of the human occupation of physical space . These approaches include movement , 
network , node , hierarchy , and surface models , among others ( Chorley and Haggett , 
1967 ; Christaller , 1966 ; Haggett , 1965 ; Harvey , 1969 ; see also Hodder and Orton ,

1976 )  . The second course was influenced by the adoption of a loose federation
of humanistic philosophies and methodologies in the exploration of human values , beliefs , and perceptions ( Buttimer , 1974 ; Hugill and Foote , 1995 )  . These
perspectives include existentialism , feminism , idealism , phenomenology , and interactionism ( e . g .  , Entrikin , 1976 , 1991 ; Ley and Samuels , 1978 ; Relph , 1976 , 
1985 ; Soja , 1989 ; Tuan , 1974 , 1977 ; Zelinsky , 1975 )  . 
Researchers of the latter perspectives apply social and cultural theory to landscape interpretation in three complementary ways ( cf . Cosgrove , 1994 , p . 115 ; 
Duncan , 1994 , p . 317 ; see also Cosgrove , 1984 ; Cosgrove and Daniels , 1988 ; 
Penning-Rowsell and Lowenthal , 1986 )  . First , they often show a greater concern
for sociocultural and political processes in landscape-shaping processes than people ’ s relations with specific natural environmental contexts . Second , they apply
critical social and cultural theory in its humanistic interpretations . Third , they
consider all forms of landscape , not just visible physical features , as cultural signifiers whose interpretation reveals cultural attitudes and processes . Within these
approaches , contemporary geographers ’ landscape efforts range from strongly behavioral to symbolic , even artistic ( e . g .  , see Thompson , 1995a )  . This work at times
continues to overlap with archaeological research interests , especially where investigators consider landscapes as material constructs that embed information on
the structure and organization of past occupations and that serve as a kind of
historical text ( Hugill and Foote , 1995 , p . 20 )  . Although a small number of researchers ( Giddens , 1979 , 1984 ; Gregory , 1978 , 1981 ; H¨agerstrand , 1976 , 1988 ; 
Pred , 1984 , 1990 ) obtain a certain accommodation of spatial scientific and humanistic perspectives in their studies , the discipline overall has not yet successfully
integrated these fields , with some universities maintaining separate departments
of human and physical geography ( Anderson and Gale , 1992 )  . 
Although landscape as a social science concept has its origins in geography , 
some of the most spirited discussions of the idea over the last two decades have
occurred in other fields , including architecture and environmental design , historical
ecology , cultural anthropology , and archaeology . Within landscape architecture
and environmental design , a number of scholars ( Hayden , 1981 , 1997 ; Jojola , 
1990 ; Rainey , 1997 ; Stilgoe , 1982 , 1998 ; Swentzell , 1990a ; Zube 1994 ) view
landscape not as a single uniform construct but as a multiplicity of coexisting
texts that either provide unity for a community or serve as an arena of cultural
tension and social conflict ( after Groth , 1997 )  . While physical landscape features—
physiographic phenomena and buildings alike—may appear unchanged over time , 
the meanings bestowed on them silently may undergo subtle shifts or wholescale
transformations . 
The best known proponent in landscape architecture is John Brinkerhoff
Jackson ( 1984 , 1994 , 1995 ; see also Meinig , 1979b )  , whose work implicitly forms
an integral part of the intellectual foundation upon which some anthropologists
now are building their own landscape approaches . For Jackson a landscape is “ a

166 Anschuetz , Wilshusen , and Scheick
space or collection of spaces made by a group of people who modify the natural
environment to survive , to create order , and to produce .  .  . society ”  ( Jackson , 1995 , 
p . 43 ; see also Jackson , 1984 , 1994 )  . In viewing varied landscape elements as products of human values and aspirations , Jackson maintains that a landscape “ is never
simply a natural space , a feature of the natural environment ”  ( 1984 , p . 156 )  . In
emphasizing the synthetic characteristics of landscapes , he considers vernacular
design . Where the organization of space is largely or entirely free of overt political
influence , communities occupy and use spaces “ governed by custom , held together
by personal relationship ”  ( 1984 , p . 150 )  . Jackson elaborates further upon a landscape ’ s essential temporal dimension :  “ A landscape is thus a space deliberately
created to speed up or slow down the process of nature ”  ( 1984 , p . 8 ) and history
becomes a substitute for “ natural processes of growth and maturity and decay ”  
( 1984 , p . 156 )  . 
Jackson ’ s emphasis on vernacular design and history as important elements of
landscape studies resulted in a profoundly different view of landscape design than
was common in architecture . Architects and environmental designers not only are
artists of space but also of time ( Brand , 1994 ; Rapoport , 1990 )  . Rapoport ( 1990 ) 
argues for the centrality of meaning in material culture and for the relevance of
studies that address culture-specific patterning in the remains human communities
leave on the land . Rapoport recognizes a strong , recurring general pattern in his
comparative study of environmental design . He observes ,  “ People seem to shape
and interact with built environments / material culture primarily through meaning
and this seems to hold over time , cross-culturally , and in all kinds of environments , 
contexts , and situations ”  ( Rapoport , 1990 , p . 42 )  . Even though generations of people might inhabit and modify multiple places within their community landscape
differently , the residual material traces share elements of a common underlying organizational pattern as long as fundamental cultural traditions remain intact ( e . g .  , 
see Rapoport , 1990 , p . 17 )  . 
Explication of linkages between changing occupation patterns and time perhaps is developed fullest in regional environmental analyses known as historical
ecology . Crumley and Marquardt ’ s study ( 1987 ) of historic Burgundian landscapes
typifies a landscape approach in its use of a variety of textual , remote sensing , and
GIS data . Kirch ( 1994 , 1997 ; see also Kirch and Hunt , 1997 ) uses a comparable
historical ecological approach in his comprehensive examination of Pacific culture
history . 
Historical ecologists characteristically embrace a traditional landscape concern of humanistic geographers , namely , the idea that vernacular and formally built
landscapes reflect a group ’ s essential values and beliefs ( e . g .  , Crumley , 1994 )  . They
follow humanistic geography by interpreting vernacular and formal landscapes in
terms of communities ’ values and beliefs . As Crumley and Marquardt espouse 
 “ people project culture onto nature ”  ( 1990 , p . 73 )  . In promoting the idea of interdependent senses of time and place , Winterhalder ( 1994 , p . 18 ) observes ,

Archaeology of Landscapes 167
We can isolate such things as sociocultural or environmental causal factors or processes . 
Important properties of these may depend on their location in time , that is , they may have
a temporal dimension . Nonetheless , we cannot define or isolate time itself as a causal
variable or process . The same is true of ( so-called ) spatial variables or processes [ emphasis
in original ]  . 
Historical ecologists argue that sociohistorical structures , such as class , kin , 
or interest groups , in combination with physical structures , such as climate , geology , and topography , determine landscape . By investigating social boundaries , they
consider interactions of different communities and the effects of these relationships
on landscapes . Their evaluations of the changing nature of boundaries , depending
on time or scale of analysis , illustrate landscape dynamics . Finally , historical ecologists vigorously oppose the uncritical nesting they see in many archaeological
and ecological landscape analyses ( Crumley and Marquardt , 1987 , 1990 )  . They
argue that changing risks and needs might subvert creation of a realistic hierarchy
of parameters that condition regional behavior . 
Cultural anthropologists offer much work on the ideas of place in terms of social identity and contestation ( e . g .  , see Feld and Basso , 1996b , p . 4 )  . Dialogues between indigenous peoples and anthropologists on heritage resources conservation
and management of cultural properties illustrate the ways in which landscapes often are important to communities for sustaining memory and tradition ( Carmichael
et al .  , 1994 ; Hena and Anschuetz , 2000 ; Kelley and Francis , 1994 ; Swidler et al .  , 
1997 )  . In exploring the dynamic properties of landscapes , cultural anthropologists
cite the uncertainties , discontinuities , and multiplicities of voices and action linked
to contestation and movement . They challenge the common underlying idea that
places are defined by static boundaries and relationships based on stable residence 
( Feld and Basso , 1996b , p . 5 , citing Appadurai and Breckenridge 1988 ; Deleuze
and Guattari , 1986 ; Kapferer , 1988 ; Rosaldo , 1988 )  . Instead , researchers suggest
that , in borderlands characterized by fluidity and hybridization , landscape relationships can be based on place indeterminacy ( Feld and Basso , 1996b , pp . 5 , 6 , 
citing Appadurai , 1992 ; Gupta and Ferguson , 1992 ; Gupta et al .  , 1992 )  . Despite the
absence of fixity among such “ ethnoscapes ”  ( Appadurai , 1992 )  , communities are
able to sustain coherent cognitive maps based on perceptions , direct experiences
and distant memories , constructed meanings , and imagination . 
Recent anthologies by Hirsch and O ’ Hanlon ( 1995 ) and Feld and Basso 
( 1996a ) offer useful comparative insights on the cultural construction of landscapes . The Hirsch and O ’ Hanlon ( 1995 ) volume consists of an art historian ’ s
review of the landscape concept ( Hirsch 1995 ) and ethnographic case studies that
examine spatial history and place concepts cross-culturally . The volume illustrates the dynamic qualities of culturally constructed landscapes as people move
between a “ foreground ” of everyday , unreflexive forms of experience among perceived images of place and a “ background ” of social potentiality among spaces
and representations of those spaces ( Hirsch , 1995 , pp . 4 , 5 )  .

The Feld and Basso ( 1996a ; see also Basso 1996 ) anthology focuses on native perceptions and experiences in giving meaning to particular localities . The
collective goal of these essays is to examine “ the complex ways in which places
anchor lives in social formations ranging widely in geographical location , in economic and political scale , and in the accompanying realms of gender , race , class , 
and ethnicity ”  ( Feld and Basso 1996b , p . 7 )  . The essays illustrate how people
creatively fashion themselves and their landscapes through their occupation of
spaces , thereby illustrating the interdependence of the physical and the ideational
within human environments . They provide examples of how negotiated social roles 
( e . g .  , age , gender , sex , kin group , class , and ethnicity )  , their interrelationships , and
peoples ’ identities are mapped variously on the landscape . 
FOUNDATIONS FOR ADOPTING LANDSCAPE CONCEPTS
IN ARCHAEOLOGICAL PRACTICE
Distribution Studies and Settlement Patterns
As Knapp and Ashmore observe ,  “ As long as archaeologists have studied the
human past , they have been interested in space , and consequently , in landscapes ”  
( 1999 , p . 1 )  . In the early twentieth century , British geographers and archaeologists
together pioneered the use of distribution maps ( e . g .  , Crawford , 1912 , 1922 ; Fleure
and Whitehouse , 1916 ; see also Daniel , 1964 ; Goudie , 1987 )  . By accurately locating archaeological phenomena in space , these investigators quickly began building
explanations of site distributions in terms of geographic features ( Crawford , 1922 , 
p . 257 ; Fox 1923 , 1947 )  . Clark adds that the distribution map “ by its very existence implies the co-ordination of scattered evidences and the establishment of a
synthetic relation with their geographical background ”  ( 1933 , p . 232 )  . As a product of environmental determinism that pervaded much of early twentieth century
intellectual thought , this synthetic relationship was distinctly asymmetrical . With
the increasing availability of evidence documenting climatic changes during the
Quaternary , researchers began interpreting the changing patterns of site distribution over time in terms of natural environmental fluctuations ( e . g .  , Childe 1928 , 
1952 )  . 
The innovation of regional archaeological settlement pattern research during
the late 1940s and the early 1950s ( e . g .  , Wauchope , 1956 ; Willey , 1953 , 1956 ) was
a descendent of these early distribution studies . The foundation of these approaches
was the premise that settlement patterns not only reflect the natural environment
but they also are shaped directly by cultural needs ( Willey , 1953 , p . 1 ; see also the
later discussions )  . 
Settlement pattern approaches were inspired , in part , by Steward ’ s 
( Steward , 1937 , 1955 ) and Clark ’ s ( Clark , 1939 ) pioneering efforts in ecological
anthropology , which considers the relations between the structure and organization

of how a cultural group earns its living and the group ’ s natural environment . 
Braidwood ’ s ( Braidwood , 1974 ) Iraq Jarmo Project and Caldwell ’ s ( Caldwell , 
1958 ) work in the eastern United States provided further impetus by establishing
the place of archaeological data in understanding economic , social , and political
transformations . 
Willey ’ s ( Willey , 1953 ) Vir´u Valley work in Peru quickly received recognition as a prototype for settlement pattern studies . Willey systematically examined
approximately 350 sq km , using aerial photos and site drawings made from those
photos . Documenting 315 sites , roughly a 25% sample , Willey developed a settlement typology focused on dwellings , cemeteries , hilltop redoubts , pyramids , and
compounds . 
Willey ’ s articulation of the settlement pattern approach is more than a set
of techniques for identifying , describing , and classifying archaeological sites
and their natural ecology scattered across large spatial areas . Agnew observes
that Willey ’ s efforts generally followed geography ’ s lead by defining regional
study as “ the areal variation of human and physical phenomena as they relate
to other spatially proximate and causally linked phenomena ”  ( 1994 , p . 25 ; see
also Gregory , 1994b , pp . 507–509 )  . By incorporating Ford ’ s ( Ford , 1949 ) ceramic
studies for chronological control in his analysis , Willey contributed to the development of archaeological methods and data for interpreting long-term social changes
within regions based on internal transformations rather than external factors such
as diffusion or migration . Importantly , the emergent settlement pattern concept
rested on basic principles that generally are compatible with a landscape paradigm
today . 
As Willey notes ,  “ settlements reflect the natural environment , the level of
technology on which the builders operated , and the various institutions of social
interaction and control which culture maintained . Because settlement patterns
are , to a large extent , directly shaped by widely held cultural needs , they offer a
strategic point for the functional interpretation of archaeological cultures ”  ( 1953 , 
p . 1 )  . He subsequently adds that settlement patterns , in effect ,  “ provide a key for the
reconstruction of ecological , cultural , and social systems ”  ( Willey , 1973 , p . 270 ) 
and constitute “ a basis for cross-cultural and causal generalization in the study of
settlement forms ”  ( Willey , 1974 , p . 159 )  . 
After Willey ’ s ( Willey , 1953 ) breakthrough in Vir´u Valley study , archaeological site survey methods became increasingly rigorous in implementing regional
and subregional scales of analyses . A number of Mesoamerican surveys during
the 1960s and 1970s are classics for regional survey for their many methodological contributions ( e . g .  , Blanton , 1978 ; Coe 1967 ; Parsons , 1971 ; Sanders , 1965 ; 
Sanders et al .  , 1979 ; Spores , 1969 )  . Elsewhere , Chang ( 1958 , 1963 , 1967 ) established precedents for examining settlement and social organization through the
study of households , local social groups , and communities in his work in northern
China . Conducting research on Mesopotamia ’ s Diyala Plain , Adams ( 1965 , 1981 ; 
Adams and Nissen , 1972 ) contributed innovative frameworks for evaluating how

political changes helped condition subsequent transformations in economic tactics
and strategies . 
The body of regional archaeological studies in just the past 15 years is expansive and diverse ( e . g .  , see Billman and Feinman , 1999 ; Barton et al .  , 1999 ; Blanton
et al .  , 1993 ; Feinman and Nicholas , 1990 ; Fish and Kowalewski , 1990 ; Hendon , 
1992 ; Kowalewski et al .  , 1989 ; Ramsden et al . 1995 ; Spencer and Redmond , 1997 ; 
Stark and Arnold , 1997 )  . The productivity and sophistication of this work has been
fueled , in part , by the increasing attention archaeologists gave to the relationships
among central settlements , smaller residential sites , and varied assemblages of
nonhabitation features found throughout their study areas ( e . g .  , see Scarborough
et al .  , 1995 ; Schortman and Urban , 1994 ; Wells , 1994 ; Wilkinson 1994 )  . The
analytical power , the widespread availability , and the comparative ease of computerized applications of geographical model-based paradigms ( shown earlier ) within
geographical information systems ( GIS ) packages is providing archaeologists now
with a new set of quantitative tools for research of spatial patterns at macro- and
microscales . GIS approaches range from natural environmental foci to those addressing the many nested relationships that people maintain with their physical
settings and one another ( see review by Kvamme , 1999 )  . 
Settlement Systems
The intellectual bases of settlement pattern studies evolved in sophistication in tandem with the discipline ’ s widespread embrace of the new archaeology
throughout the 1960s and early 1970s ( see Binford , 1972 ; Clarke , 1977 ; see also
Caldwell , 1959 )  . In systematizing their analyses , archaeologists moved beyond descriptive documentation of site distributions and organizational hierarchies within
regions to interpretation of the multivariate dynamics underlying archaeologically
observed patterns across the dimensions of space and time . Drawing from general
systems theory ( Bertalanffy , 1968 )  , some archaeologists consider the interaction
of variables—both natural and cultural—that they believe conditioned structural
changes in settlement patterns . These researchers presume that the study of the interactions among such components allows a more comprehensive understanding of
the system ’ s functioning and its pattern of change . Clarke ( 1968 , 1972 , 1977 ) and
Johnson ( 1975 , 1977 ) are proponents for the use of locational analysis at various
scales to understand the systemic variation and interaction among contemporary
sites . This concern for explicating settlement pattern changes resulted in the adoption of settlement system approaches , which address “ the set of [ probabilistic ]  
 ‘ rules ’ that generated the [ settlement ] pattern in the first place ”  ( Flannery , 1976 , 
p . 162 )  . 
In promoting systematization of settlement pattern studies , Binford ( 1982 ) 
recognizes that even though “ excavated sites are the archaeologists ’ bread and
butter ”  ( 1983 , p . 109 )  , the landscape , not the site , is the arena for all of a group ’ s

economic , social , and ideological activities . Binford adds ,  “ Site patterning in both
within-place and between-place contexts is a property of the archaeological record ”  
( 1982 , p . 5 , emphasis in original )  . Binford ’ s ( Binford , 1980 , 1982 , 1983 ) now
classic ethnoarchaeological studies , in turn , was a call for archaeologists to consider material traces and their contexts , including their depositional and spatial
characteristics , beyond traditionally defined site boundaries . His recognition that
observable patterns in both material traces and empty spaces come from interactions between culturally organized social dimensions and nonculturally organized
resources and life-space distributions helps define the conceptual foundations for
a landscape paradigm ( Binford , 1983 ; discussed earlier )  . 
An emphasis on documenting selected variables presumed to play key roles in
conditioning cultural change is preeminent among settlement system approaches . 
In particular , archaeologists have expended considerable effort in explicating technology and subsistence patterns in relation to issues of ecological adaptation . For
example , Struever argues that because a population ’ s subsistence tactics and strategies exert primary influence in how a cultural system functions , settlement patterns
are “ an essential corollary of subsistence ”  ( 1968 , p . 133 )  . Flannery ( 1972 , among
others ) contributes further to the refinement of settlement systems by urging researchers to concentrate on building explanations for the patterns of change visible
in the archaeological record in implementing settlement system approaches . 
Settlement system approaches remain at the core of many recent interpretive regional and subregional studies ( e . g .  , Albarracin-Jordan , 1996 ; Balkansky , 
1998 ; Cherry et al .  , 1991 ; Duke , 1995 ; Dunning et al .  , 1999 ; Erickson , 1999 ; 
Fisher et al .  , 1999 ; Gartner , 1999 ; Hyslop , 1990 ; Julien , 1993 ; Kolata , 1996 ; 
Marcus , 1998 ; Marcus and Flannery , 1996 ; Reeves-Smythe and Hammond , 1983 ; 
Schlanger , 1992 ; Schortman and Urban , 1992 ; Thurston , 1999 ; Whittlesey et al .  , 
1997 ; Wilshusen and Wilson 1995 ; Wilson , 1988 )  . As an assemblage , these studies
contribute varied insights into the diversity , the complexity , and the dynamic interdependence among humans ’ technological structures , their social , political , and
religious organizations , and the physical environments in which they live . Many of
the humanistic interpretive approaches pioneered in Europe to address the social
and symbolic aspects of landscapes ( e . g .  , Hodder , 1984 , 1987 ; discussed later ) also
share aspects of their intellectual heritage with the systems approach advocated
more than a generation ago by Clarke ( 1968 , 1977 ) and his contemporaries . 
Distributional Archaeology as Archaeological Landscapes
The settlement system studies confronted difficulties in areas where the distributions and ranges of archaeological traces did not conform either spatially
or conceptually with traditionally recognized site types . In combination with
Binford ’ s ( 1980 , 1982 , 1983 ; discussed earlier ) call for going beyond traditionally defined site boundaries for evaluating archaeological traces , these challenges

provided the impetus for development of methodological approaches known as 
 “ nonsite ,  ”  “ offsite ,  ” and “ distributional ” archaeology ( Cherry , 1983 ; Cherry et al . 
1988 , 1991 ; Dunnell , 1992 ; Dunnell and Dancy , 1983 ; Ebert , 1992 ; Foley , 1981 ; 
Rossignol and Wandsnider , 1992 )  . These studies emphasize descriptive methods
and site-formation concerns at the level of regional archaeological variation . 
Proponents of distributional archaeological approaches are reacting to the
reliability of archaeological sites as units of spatial analysis ( Cherry , 1983 ; Cherry
et al .  , 1988 , 1991 ; Dunnell , 1992 ; Dunnell and Dancy , 1983 ; Ebert , 1992 ; in
Wandsnider , 1998 , p . 94 )  . Some investigators ( Dunnell , 1992 ; Dunnell and Dancy , 
1983 ; Ebert , 1992 ) forward the opinion that archaeological sites methodologically
and theoretically are flawed units of analysis . Dunnell suggests the solution to
this fundamental issue “ lies not in ‘ refining ’ the notion of site or tinkering with
density thresholds or other means of site delineation ” but in “ developing methods
of constructing units of historical association from smaller-scale observational
units ”  ( 1992 , p . 33 )  . 
As summarized by Wandsnider ( 1998 , p . 94 )  , nonsite approaches are founded
in these primary concerns . First , proponents identify the subjectivity inherent in
survey-based site definitions ( after Cherry et al .  , 1988 , 1991 )  . Second , they suggest the units of analysis commonly used in settlement pattern and settlement system analyses are teleological ( after Wandsnider , 1998 )  . Third , nonsite researchers
question the assumption that sites of the same temporal phase are strictly contemporaneous ( after Dewar , 1992 ; Schacht , 1984 )  . Instead , proponents emphasize that
studies of the spatial distributions of artifacts , features , and other material remains
offer a more accurate and precise picture of the archaeological record . 
Historical Landscapes : Landscape Archaeology in the Americas
With the emergence of the new archaeology in the 1960s , Americanist archaeologists recognized that anthropogenic landscape modifications entail more
than physical modifications of the environment ; they also entail patterns linked
to “ social and ideological dimensions ”  ( Deetz , 1990 , p . 2 )  . Initially , ventures into
this archaeology of landscapes were historical treatises . This early work characteristically was cast as ( 1 ) large-scale phenomena transcending the strict boundaries
of localities and ( 2 )  “ the highest level of mediation between the natural and the
cultural , against which all other mediating material culture is projected ”  ( Deetz , 
1990 , p . 2 )  . Although known primarily for their concentration on particular gardens , battlefields , and similar “ offsite ” phenomena ( e . g .  , Fox , 1988 ; Kelso and
Most , 1990 ; Leone , 1984 ; Miller and Gleason , 1994 )  , their research perspective
is broadening to consider historically documented landscapes more holistically , 
including changing settlement organization , demography , and sociopolitical relations ( Lycett , 1995 ; Paynter , 2000 ; Yamin and Metheny , 1996 ; Zede˜no , 1997 ; 
Zede˜no et al .  , 1997 )  .

Archaeology of Landscapes 173
In their undertakings , these researchers recognize that landscapes exist “ for
reasons other than strictly practical and utilitarian ”  ( Deetz , 1990 , p . 2 )  . To explore
the cultural bases of landscapes and the roles of human actors in shaping and
constructing meanings of places , these studies borrow heavily from humanistic
geography ( Cosgrove and Daniels , 1988 ; Groth and Bressi , 1997 ; Lewis , 1979 ; 
Meinig , 1979a ; Tuan , 1974 , 1977 ; Wagstaff , 1987 ) and postprocessual archaeology 
( Fritz , 1987 ; Hodder , 1987 , 1991 ; Hodder et al .  , 1995 ; Tilley , 1994 ) for their
interpretive frameworks ( see also the later discussions )  . 
Social Formation and Symbolic Landscapes : Landscape Archaeology
in Europe
In Europe , but most especially in England , the foundations of landscape
archaeology came in the middle twentieth century when field archaeology embraced intellectual perspectives offered by contemporary geographers and historians ( Roberts , 1987 , p . 78 )  . The fruits of this interdisciplinary effort , as exemplified
in the work of Michael Aston ( 1985 )  , are comprehensive , systemic descriptions
of “ the landscape as a palimpsest of boundaries , mounds , abandoned villages , 
and field systems ”  ( Thomas , 1993 , p . 25 )  . At this juncture , Europeanist studies
generally resemble those of their Americanist counterparts . 
Sustained interest in European megaliths and other monumental architectural
remnants at regional scales , which represent kinds of human thought and action
neglected by traditional approaches , fueled vigorous study of social and symbolic landscapes ( Barrett , 1988 , 1991 ; Barrett et al .  , 1991 ; Bender , 1993b , 1998 ; 
Bradley , 1993b , 1998a , 1998b ; Darvill , 1997 ; Hodder , 1984 , 1987 ; McMann , 
1994 ; Richards , 1990 , 1996 ; Roberts , 1996 ; Tilley , 1996 ; Thomas , 1993 , 1996 )  . 
Rather than limiting their work to documentary case studies , these researchers
used structuration theory ( Giddens , 1979 , 1984 ) and the concept of symbolic capital ( Bourdieu , 1977 ) to analyze social action and the manipulation of material
culture and space within a broader system of symbolic meaning . 
Structuration theory , which recognizes the mutual dependence of social structure and agency , holds that “ the structural properties of social systems are both
the medium and the outcome of practices that constitute these systems ”  ( Giddens , 
1979 , p . 69 )  . This construct refers to recurrent patterning in the way people do
things and relate to one another across the dimensions of space and time ( Giddens , 
1984 )  . Symbolic capital , in turn , refers to how meanings assigned to material goods
and other objects are critical to how individuals structure their world ( after Earle
and Preucel , 1987 , p . 506 )  . Moreover , space obtains importance through both its
economic values and its strategic use by actors . 
Drawing from geographers ( Cosgrove , 1985 ; Cosgrove and Daniels , 1988 ; 
Daniels , 1989 ; Jackson , 1980 , 1984 ; Meinig , 1979a ; Tuan , 1974 ; Zelinsky , 1973 )  ,

manifestations of belief systems . In this process , they are moving landscape archaeology studies into the realms of cognition and ideation ( Bender , 1993b , 1998 ; 
Bender et al .  , 1997 ; Bradley , 1993b , 1997 ; Renfrew , 1982 )  . 
Discussion
In its early decades , settlement pattern studies characteristically focused on
spatial interrelationships among sites with domestic or public architecture . As a
product of their times , these studies overemphasized the descriptive constructs
on what the past was like rather than explanations of why observed technological and organizational changes in settlement patterns occurred ( e . g .  , see Sabloff , 
1983 , pp . 414–415 ; Willey , 1983 , pp . 446–447 )  . Settlement system , distributional , 
historical , and social / symbolic approaches each offer useful tools for explicating
regional archaeological patterns . Individually , however , the approaches fell short
of providing truly comprehensive explanations of past behavioral dynamics . 
As we have noted earlier , development of the basic settlement pattern concept from its outset was linked closely with Steward ’ s ( 1937 , 1955 ) and Clark ’ s 
( 1939 ) contributions to cultural ecology . This association facilitated the rapid and
widespread acceptance of ecosystem concepts and general systems theory perspectives promoted by cultural anthropologists , geographers , and ecologists ( e . g .  , 
Butzer , 1971 , 1982 , 1994 ; Rappaport , 1968 , 1979 ; Vayda and McCay , 1975 ) in archaeology . Because the cultural ecological approach draws concepts from ecology , 
history , political , and cultural theory into a single focus , archaeologists are better
able to illuminate the many factors contributing to processes of cultural change . 
As Trigger notes , however ,  “ In terms of causal factors , a systems approach serves
to describe rather than to explain change ”  ( 1989 , p . 308 )  . 
Reliance on ecological theory and cybernetic perspectives fueled a tendency
for settlement pattern researchers to treat human populations “ conceptually as the
same as any other animal population struggling for survival amidst the complex
webs of ecosystemic relations ”  ( Watts , 1994 , p . 111 )  . Researchers traditionally
tend to presume that the possible contributing roles of social organization and
ideation in culture change are weaker and less recognizable than the role of people ’ s
relations with their physical environment through their productive technologies . 
Moreover , an implicit antihistoricism is evident in much of the work conducted
during the 1970s and 1980s ( Trigger , 1978 , 1989 , pp . 312–319 ; Wolf , 1982 ; see
also Knapp , 1996 , p . 141 )  . 
In responding to both Flannery ’ s ( Flannery , 1976 ) call for archaeology to
build understandings of the “ rules ” that structure how people interact with their
environments and occupy their landscapes and the postprocessual critique , settlement system studies have adopted a broader perspective . These studies increasingly
are incorporating questions of history , perception , human agency , sociopolitical

relations , and identity into assessments of archaeologically visible spatial patterns . 
In doing so , researchers are redefining their understandings of the environment as
layered physical , technological , economic , social , political , and ideational realms
that seemingly represent aspects of the intellectual legacy that Hawkes ( 1954 ) 
outlined in his “ ladder of inference ” nearly a half century ago . 
The redefinition of understanding comes from the recognition that the environment is partly a construction of people ’ s dynamic interactions with their physical settings . Moreover , these interactions are historically contingent , accretionary , 
and shaped through cultural perception and past human actions ( after Fisher and
Thurston , 1999b , p . 631 ; see also Feinman , 1999 , p . 685 )  . With refinement in the
conceptualization of the human environment comes redefinition of the understanding of the web of interrelationships that is human ecology . As such , the study of
settlement systems is moving toward the study of settlement ecology ( e . g .  , see
Stone , 1993 , 1996 )  . 
Dependence upon historical or ethnohistorical documentation or both effectively constrains the time depth of traditional historical landscape studies . In practice , historical constructions tend to be insular , and the development of frameworks
for cross-cultural comparisons are still in their initial stages . By their concern with
understanding the varied processes that shape human life , however , historical approaches contribute information on how the surviving material traces making up
the archaeological record provide insights into questions of differential access to resources and power ( after Paynter , 2000 )  . These efforts are yielding comprehensive
information on particular localities , which provide researchers with opportunities
to work through other archaeological analytical and interpretive approaches to
construct fuller explanations of the past . 
Associated with postmodernism generally and postprocessual archaeological
approaches specifically , social formation and symbolic landscape approaches emphasize humanistic perspectives that prominently cast people as rational , creative , 
and aesthetic actors . These studies place great emphasis on building historically
contextualized understandings . Humanistic archaeologists offer intriguing insights
into the structure and organization of people ’ s behavior in the past , and , in turn , 
they are creating new conceptual categories that warrant consideration . Conceptualizations of the interaction between people and their natural environments tend
to be defined narrowly , and the possibilities of natural environmental fluctuations
often are considered less important than factors internal to society in processes of
cultural change . As demonstrated through the recent work of Barrett ( 1994 ) and
Bradley ( 1993b , 1997 )  , however , humanistic perspectives now are constructing
bridges back to the concerns of processual archaeologists ( see Knapp 1996 )  . 
Given this short history of the diverse and sometimes seemingly incompatible
perspectives used in contemporary archaeological practice , it is fair to question why
archaeologists are embracing landscape concepts enthusiastically at this time . This
trend is more meaningful and more important , however , than a simple assertion that

the ambiguity in landscape serves as an overarching gloss for any investigation
that considers spatial distributions intermixed with references to sociopolitical
relations and ideation . 
Whitley ( 1992 , pp . 76 , 77 ) and Knapp ( 1996 , p . 147 ) observe that the discipline already has moved well beyond processual archaeology ’ s methodological
concerns and postprocessual archaeology ’ s ethnography of the past at the end
of the twentieth century . Contemporary archaeology calls for multiple research
paths and interpretive perspectives in its conduct ( after Preucel , 1991 ; Thomas , 
1990 ; Wylie , 1993a , 1993b )  . The challenge is for researchers throughout the discipline to “ learn to live with the notion of mutually irreconcilable views about the
past ”  ( Knapp 1996 , p . 148 , see also pp . 150–152 ) even while they seek common
ground for different archaeologies . Knapp maintains that the historical aspects of
archaeological theory must be recognized and emphasized if cognition , ideology , 
and .  .  . human agency .  .  . are to be accorded their proper role in the study of the
past ”  ( 1996 , p . 149 )  . 
A landscape paradigm offers the potential to accommodate , if not integrate , 
different theoretical perspectives even while these constructs seemingly exist in
tension with one another in their presentation of alternative constructions of the
past ( see also the later discussions )  . The strengths of the major contemporary archaeological approaches—settlement system analysis , distributional archaeology , 
and historical , social , and symbolic landscape approaches—all contribute to the
foundations of an archaeology of landscapes . The specific challenge of this endeavor is to build a broad , synthetic framework for comprehensive understandings
of historically contingent processes . 
RECENT ARCHAEOLOGICAL USES OF LANDSCAPE CONCEPTS
Over the last few years , researchers have presented arguments representing the
discipline ’ s increasingly confident steps toward building a theoretically grounded
and practical paradigm for the archaeology of landscapes . As we have discussed
later , an articulated landscape paradigm , whose methodological bases remain to
be defined explicitly , will emerge directly from these archaeological applications
of landscape . 
Three contrasting , yet complementary , general aspects of landscapes will
likely contribute toward the definition of the paradigm ’ s foundations :  ( 1 ) settlement
ecology ,  ( 2 ) ritual landscapes , and ( 3 ) ethnic landscapes . Each of these components
emphasizes different aspects of how humans define , shape , and use space at particular times . Together , they address some of the essential historically contingent
processes that underlie how people transform space into place ( cf . Casey , 1996 )  . 
This list is neither exhaustive nor sufficient for defining a landscape paradigm comprehensively . To the contrary , this discussion provides only a partial

illustration . Other researchers will introduce a variety of more specific physical
and humanistic aspects of landscapes that will serve to broaden and refine the
framework sketched out here . The articulation of the many contrasting perspectives embodied in contemporary archaeological research is needed ( shown later ) 
to achieve a comprehensive , historically aware understanding of the past that is
sensitive to the great breadth and interdependency among the parts forming the
web of people ’ s interactions with their environments . 
Settlement Ecology
Perhaps the most readily accessible of these emergent archaeological landscape approaches for many archaeologists is settlement ecology . Owing much intellectually to settlement pattern and system approaches , the redefined settlement
ecology perspective recognizes history and cultural perception as contributing
variables to the structure , organization , and tempo of culture change ( e . g .  , Stone , 
1993 , 1996 ; see also Anschuetz , 1998 ; Roberts , 1996 ; Whittlesey et al .  , 1997 )  . As
such , settlement ecology addresses issues of archaeologically observed patterns of
land use , occupation , and transformation over time . 
Settlement ecology acknowledges that landscapes are the products of people ’ s interactions with their environments and considers this continuum defined by
a matrix of land-extensive and labor-intensive tactics and strategies . This approach
emphasizes natural environmental variables , including essential subsistence resources , other raw materials needed for physical comfort and health , and items for
trade or exchange . The availability of many basic resources and common amenities often changes unpredictably across time and space from cultural and natural
factors . Settlement ecology examines the central issue of dynamic risk management through a community ’ s deployment of its economic , social , and ideational
technologies ( e . g .  , see Stone 1993 , 1996 )  . 
Because settlement ecology also recognizes the social and ideational components of a group ’ s effective environment , this approach considers the roles of
culture and tradition as additional filters in how groups structure and organize
their use and occupation of places . Culturally conditioned patterns of environmental perception and land use traditions in turn affect the mode and tempo of change in
group interactions with their environment . For example , a series of gradual smallscale changes in archaeological patterns over time might represent adjustments
that , over the short term at least , successfully dampen recurrent environmental
perturbation . Rapid large-scale systemic changes , in comparison , might represent significant realignments to resolve contradictory operational and cognitive
models for community interactions with their environment ( see Rappaport , 1979 , 
p . 168 ; see also Anschuetz , 1998 , pp . 57–59 )  . Transformations that necessarily respect and sustain a community ’ s traditions and revolutions that are rejections and

restructuring of existing traditions are distinguishable by examining the continuities and discontinuities in archaeological spatial patterns over time . 
Ritual Landscapes
Ritual landscapes are the products of stereotyped actions , including specific
acts and sequences of acts ( see Rappaport , 1999 , pp . 35 , 36 )  , that represent the socially prescribed orders by which communities define , legitimize , and sustain their
occupation of their traditional homelands . Less familiar than settlement ecology , 
ritual landscape studies rapidly are becoming a focal point for archaeological investigation ( e . g .  , Bradley , 1998a , 1998b ; Bradley and Chambers , 1988 ; Carmichael
et al .  , 1994 ; Carrasco , 1991 ; Darvill , 1997 ; Fowler and Stein , 1992 ; Freidel et al .  , 
1993 ; Hall , 1985 , 1997 ; Ingold , 1993 ; Oosten , 1997 ; Richards , 1990 , 1996 ; Robb
1998 ; Stein and Lekson , 1992 ; Tilley , 1994 )  . 
As Basso ( 1996 ) notes , traditional wisdom often is tied to places , thus the
landscape is full of history , legend , knowledge , and power that help structure
activities and organize relationships . Ethnohistorically known groups have full
ritual calendars and a rich cosmology that structure , organize , and inform on much
of their landscape , which community members perceive and with which they
interact ( e . g .  , Broda , 1991 ; Connor , 1982 ; Ferguson and Hart , 1985 ; Grinnell , 1922 ; 
Hall , 1997 ; Jorgensen , 1972 ; Kelley and Francis , 1994 ; Lowie , 1922 ; Morphy , 
1995 ; Ortiz , 1969 ; Parks and Wedel , 1985 ; J . Rappaport , 1989 ; R . Rappaport , 
1968 ; Tedlock , 1979 ; Townsend , 1992 )  . 
Ritual landscape studies build on traditional archaeological examinations of
patterns in the spatial distributions of ritual features , such as public buildings , 
monuments , squares or plazas , petroglyphs or pictographs , and various vernacular markers . The combination of distributional approaches for examining nonsite
assemblages with interpretive perspectives examining the “ background ” potentiality of spaces and social representations of those spaces ( Hirsch , 1995 ) enhances
the potential to evaluate critically the ritualized incorporation of special places on
landscapes that are segregated from habitation and activity centers within a group ’ s
built environment . 
Drawing on traditional knowledge for ideas on cosmological referents of
presumed long history , researchers evaluate the social orders that help condition
how communities structure and organize their physical occupation of places . Ritual
landscape studies increasingly use analogical constructs for developing a range of
reasonable and testable ideas rather than simply citing analogy as an explanatory
tool ( cf . Wylie , 1985 )  . Researchers base their efforts in part on the premise that
probabilistic statements are possible about what conditioning variables identified
from idealized ethnographic models might or might not be applicable to the past . 
Recognizing the impossibility of conducting ethnographic investigations using archaeological methods ( see Whitley , 1992 )  , researchers also work from the

Archaeology of Landscapes 179
premise that fundamental spatial configurations visible archaeologically might relate to certain social features and culturally specific cognitive maps ( after Cowgill , 
1993 , pp . 562–564 )  . Archaeologically quantifiable observations provide the material bases for probabilistic assessments of patterns based on coherent cognitive principles ( after Rapoport , 1990 , pp . 12 , 15 )  . Ritual landscape studies thus use idealized
cognitive spatial models derived from ethnographic materials to look for patterns
of similarity and dissimilarity in the past . These patterns possibly relate to changes
in the deep patterning of ideationally informed guidelines that help condition the
underlying structure , but not the specific content , of behavior ( discussed later )  . 
Physical alterations of spaces that correspond to astronomical or cosmological phenomena are some of the most testable aspects of ritual use of landscape . 
For example , researchers tie the arrangement of Maya cities , Plains medicine
wheels , and various South American and eastern United States landscape features to astronomical or cosmological alignments ( Ashmore , 1991 ; Aveni , 1986 , 
1991 ; Brumley , 1988 ; Eddy , 1974 , 1977 ; Grey , 1963 ; Kehoe and Kehoe , 1977 ; 
Lekson , 1999 ; Parcero et al .  , 1998 ; Stein and Lekson , 1992 ; Swentzell , 1990b )  . 
In some cases , features still are in traditional use even though the history of their
construction and use may be long and complicated . 
Ethnic Landscapes
Ethnic landscapes are spatial and temporal constructs defined by communities
whose members create and manipulate material culture and symbols to signify
ethnic or cultural boundaries based on customs and shared modes of thought and
expression that might have no other sanction than tradition ( after Johnston , 1994 , 
p . 81 , citing Bell and Newby , 1978 )  . While the most challenging of the emergent
landscape approaches at present , ethnic landscapes offer the promise of being
a highly productive interpretive tool ( e . g .  , see Reid , 1997 ; Snead , 1995 ; Stark
et al .  , 1995 ; Teague , 1993 ; Wilshusen and Ortman , 1999 ; Zede˜no , 1997 )  . The
concept that landscape can be used to mark or re-create sociocultural identity is
a fundamental one and already is well established in existing research ( Ashmore , 
1989 ; Bradley , 1993b , 1997 ; Gillespie , 1991 ; Hodder , 1987 ; Ingold , 1992 ; Linares , 
1977 ; Ta¸con , 1994 )  . 
As we consider more fully later , archaeologists ’ efforts to implement ethnic
landscape studies , just as in settlement ecology and ritual landscapes , depend on
the challenge of defining the culture concept . The idea of an ethnic landscape
in archaeology initially seems to have partial roots in Kroeber ’ s ( 1923 , 1939 ; 
see also Benedict , 1934 ) classic construction of the “ culture area ,  ” even though
contemporary uses of this approach now recognize that ethnicity is not tied to
physical spaces . 
The establishment of culture areas is central to Kroeber ’ s ( Kroeber , 1923 , 
1939 ) conception of the superorganic nature of human societies and their histories . 
P1 : GFU / GDB / GDX / LMD / GCX P2 : GCR
Journal of Archaeological Research [ jar ] PP078-295745 April 20 , 2001 8 : 23 Style file version Nov . 19th , 1999
180 Anschuetz , Wilshusen , and Scheick
He viewed the culture area as a large geographical expanse with a common ecology and a common set of adaptations . Based on spatial distributions of material
culture traits , customs , and institutions , the culture area concept embodies three
aspects :  ( 1 ) the core , where a particular cultural configuration has exclusive or
near-exclusive predominance ;  ( 2 ) the domain , where one cultural arrangement
predominates among several others ; and ( 3 ) the realm , where a particular constellation of culture traits is subordinate to at least one other such constellation . 
In traditional archaeological practice concerned with the construction of
cultural–historical sequences ( e . g .  , Willey and Phillips , 1958 )  , investigators attempt to apply the cultural area concept through the comparative spatial distributions and frequencies of certain material culture traits considered diagnostic
of particular cultural groups over time . In practice , however , archaeologists confronted conceptual obstacles in their constructions of the past as they shifted their
analyses from “ regions ” occupied by disparate culture groups to “ localities ” occupied by culturally distinct communities . For this reason , the social and political
dynamics of culturally constituted places encompassed within “ regions ” often have
proven elusive . The difficulty might fuel common assumptions of the presence of
a relatively homogeneous , localized population with a common history even as archaeological evidence inspires in-depth discussions of mobility and rapid change 
( e . g .  , Lipe et al .  , 2000 )  . 
Ethnicity may be viewed as a way that individuals define their personal identity and as a type of social stratification that results when people form groups based
on their real or perceived common origins ( Hiebert , 1994 , p . 172 )  . Ethnicity is not
uniformly important among all culture groups , however . In some cases , it might be
viewed as an adaptive tactic . Moreover , ethnicity may or may not manifest itself
with particular geographic spaces . 
The ambiguities associated with the study and explanation of ethnicity pose
formidable challenges to archaeological inquiry . Clearly , study of ethnic landscapes is not relevant to all archaeological investigation . Nevertheless , the intrigue
of an ethnic landscape approach is twofold . 
First , as a general observation , because ethnicity invariably involves both
inclusionary and exclusionary behaviors , archaeologists reasonably expect to find
evidence of differential ethnic representations in their morphological , stylistic , 
and spatial studies if such societal relationships were important within cultural
communities at particular times and places . Based on analogies with other social
science findings , ethnic expressions tend to be most cohesive and identifiable under
circumstances of migration and asymmetrical power relationships ( see Hiebert , 
1994 )  . 
Second , although ethnic representations do not necessarily have spatial
representations , the formation of ethnic communities is cast in terms of social
action , guided through tradition , and played out in the arena of people ’ s interrelationships with their environments to create their landscapes ( Anschuetz et al .  , 
P1 : GFU / GDB / GDX / LMD / GCX P2 : GCR

2000 )  . Whenever a network of interacting individuals is concentrated in , or even
loosely associated with , a particular territory , communities can maintain a coherent
sense of affiliation with place ( after Appadurai , 1992 ; Appadurai and Breckenridge , 
1988 ; Deleuze and Guattari , 1986 ; Gupta and Ferguson , 1992 ; Gupta et al .  , 1992 ; 
Kapferer , 1988 ; Rosaldo , 1988 )  . 
Ethnic landscapes , clearly , like other landscapes , are extremely complicated
because they are arenas of cultural process and change for multiple communities
both simultaneously and sequentially . As such , landscapes exhibit variable histories and forever-changing occupation intervals ( Barth , 1969 ; cf . Rouse , 1965 )  . In
recent archaeological studies , some researchers argue the restriction of ethnicities
to state-level societies ( e . g .  , Emberling , 1997 )  . It is increasingly apparent , however , that ethnicity is an important feature of many prestate settings ( e . g .  , Reid , 
1997 ; Wilshusen and Ortman , 1999 )  . Productive archaeological considerations
of ethnicity that help establish the relevancy of this topic for inclusion in a landscape paradigm include Aldenderfer ( 1993 )  , Cordell and Yannie ( 1991 )  , Emberling 
( 1997 , pp . 320–324 )  , Kowalewski et al .  ( 1983 )  , Lightfoot and Martinez ( 1995 )  , 
Lipo et al .  ( 1997 )  , Murra ( 1982 )  , Stark et al .  ( 1995 )  , and Stone and Downum 
( 2000 )  . 
Discussion
Building on and refining earlier archaeological approaches to the study of
archaeological spatial distributions , settlement ecology , ritual landscapes , and ethnic landscapes address important aspects of landscapes . They also contribute useful , relevant insights into communities ’ past behavioral dynamics and patterns of
change . 
These three approaches also share the perspective that people are more than
passive recipients of change imposed from outside their cultural systems . People
are agents who contribute to conditions warranting the restructuring and reorganization of their interactions with their physical settings , with other members of
their respective communities , and with residents of other communities . Because
they emphasize different aspects of landscape relationships and dynamics , settlement ecology , ritual landscape , and ethnic landscape approaches complement
one another . As a collection of related ideas , settlement ecology and ritual and
ethnic landscape approaches help form a general framework for building a more
comprehensive body of concepts for an archaeology of landscapes . 
Before realizing this task , however , we must consider the underlying ideas
shared by these approaches . The unification of settlement ecology and ritual and
ethnic landscape approaches is possible in terms of four important anthropological
concepts : culture ( cf . Tylor , 1871 ; White , 1959 )  , tradition ( Peckham , 1990 ; Trigger , 
1991 )  , vernacular knowledge ( after Atran , 1990 )  , and the inevitability of sociocultural change ( Plog , 1974 ; see also Minnis , 1985 )  .

182 Anschuetz , Wilshusen , and Scheick
Culture continues to be a central topic of discussion for anthropology since
the discipline ’ s beginnings more than a century ago . Although culture is a unifying
concept over much of anthropology ’ s history , its appropriateness increasingly has
become a topic of debate since Kroeber and Kluckhohn ( 1952 ) noted the multiplicity of meanings ascribed to it by practitioners . Over the past decade , critiques of
the culture concept generally focus on the theme that culture inevitably “ suggests
boundedness , homogeneity , coherence , stability and structure whereas social reality is characterized by variability , inconsistencies , conflict , change and individual
agency ”  ( Brumann , 1999 , p . S1 )  . In archaeology specifically , researchers point out
repeatedly that “ Culture .  .  . is clearly not monolithic ”  ( Leonard and Reed , 1993 , 
p . 649 , emphasis in original )  . 
As used here , culture with a capital “ C ” is a uniquely human cognitive and
behavioral system for producing , storing , and transmitting information ( e . g .  , see
Anschuetz , 1998 , pp . 31–80 , after Ford , 1977 ; Hall , 1959 , 1969 ; Kirch , 1980 ; 
Rappaport , 1979 ; Trigger , 1991 ; Tylor , 1871 ; White , 1949 ; among others )  . Such
information flow patterns are highly selective in what kinds of data and how data
are transmitted among living people and between successive generations . Moreover , perceptions and meanings assigned values within a human community are
defined culturally . Thus , through daily activities , beliefs , and values , communities
transform their physical surroundings into meaningful places on particular patterns
of morphology and arrangement . Through physical modifications , intimacies of
experiences , and sharing of memories , communities reshape the natural settings
of their geographical spaces to legitimize the meanings they bestow upon the landscape . To paraphrase Boone ( 1994 , p . 7 )  , people generate a landscape of cultural
product , which their contemporaries and descendants inherit and inhabit for their
own purposes . In this process , a group ’ s landscape conceptualization becomes a
key element of its cultural heritage and provides the community with a particular
sense of time and place . 
Each cultural community ’ s particular sense of place and time , in turn , helps
organize the structure and pattern of their occupation of sustaining areas and their
use of larger physical environments ( see Anschuetz , 1998 , pp . 47–50 )  . Traditions , which generally relate to peoples ’ understandings of “ how they became
who they are ”  ( Peckham , 1990 , p . 2 )  , unify how people of a cultural community create and occupy their landscapes across the dimensions of space and time . 
Peckham ( 1990 , pp . 2–5 ) recognizes that , although traditions are prone to change 
( and thus can be analyzed logically from an evolutionary viewpoint [ e . g .  , see
Anschuetz , 1998 , pp . 44–58 for a more complete discussion ]  ) and are dynamic , 
they allow for persistence and continuity in meaning . These qualities sustain a
group ’ s senses of place and time on the landscape even as subtle changes in traditions occur throughout everyday use as people respond to and prepare for varying
circumstances . 
Trigger maintains that traditions arise out “ of the need for patterns or structural
principles that provide some degree of coherence and meaning to the inexhaustible

variety of concepts that the human mind is capable of inventing and manipulating ”  ( 1991 , p . 557 , citing Gellner , 1982 , pp . 116 , 117 )  . As Anschuetz ( 1998 , pp . 
44–58 ) observes , shared comprehension of meanings defines the contents of traditions . Two crucial issues underlie this statement . First , as Whorf ( 1956 , pp . 213 , 
214 ) argues , a common worldview among community members is implicit and
obligatory . Second , building on Whorf ’ s thesis , Lakoff and Johnson ( 1980 , p . 3 ) 
contend that fundamental concepts underlie and structure human thought ; these
concepts are matters not only of intellect but also of action and include mundane
everyday matters . Consequently , we can expect people belonging to communities
in formal and intense interaction with their environments to define and mark their
occupation of physical spaces in patterned ways of residence , subsistence , and
other activity . 
Even though traditions constrain the structure and organization of human
behavior , culture does not play a tyrannically determinist role . Following Trigger , traditions are not wholly determining “ because the human ability to reason
allows individuals to manipulate and modify culture to varying degrees ”  ( 1991 , 
p . 559 ) as they “ realize their own changing needs and aspirations ”  ( 1991 , p . 560 )  . 
A consequence of this latitude in realized behavior is that human cultural systems
encompass much greater internal behavioral variability than anthropologists and
archaeologists recognize traditionally ( Rambo , 1991 , pp . 71–72 ; see also Trigger , 
1991 , p . 552 )  . Nevertheless , the need for structural order and coherence of meaning
frame the contingent variation of culture and its open-ended capacity for elaboration ( Trigger , 1991 , p . 561 ; see also Atran , 1990 ; Berlin , 1973 ; Berlin et al .  , 
1974 ; Lakoff , 1987 ; Nazarea , 1999a ; Shore , 1996 for ethnoecological discussions
of structures that condition perception and experience )  . 
Given that traditions are the media for information transmission among humans , we necessarily need to consider how culture helps structure perception and
information transmission patterns . The idea of the conditioning role of vernacular
knowledge is relevant here . 
Vernacular knowledge refers to the processes and results of certain kinds of
ordinary thinking that people rely on as an indubitable source of truthful knowledge of their everyday world ( see Atran , 1990 , pp . 1–4 , 275 n . 1 for his discussion
of common sense )  . Vernacular knowledge refers to , and cognitively structures the
consideration of , perceivable facts ( after Atran , 1990 , pp . 1–4 )  . As universal propositions held by members of a society , the validity of such beliefs is beyond question . 
Peoples ’ intimate relationships with incidental properties of certain worldly phenomena allow them to understand and describe accurately the essence of the things
they experience . On one level , vernacular knowledge “ is just the way humans are
constitutionally disposed to think of things ”  ( Atran , 1990 , p . 2 )  . On another level , 
vernacular knowledge defines and informs their worldview . As defined by Geertz , 
worldview is “ a people ’ s picture of the way things , in sheer reality are , their concept of nature , of self , of society . It contains their most comprehensive ideas of
order ”  ( 1973 , p . 127 [ 1957 ]  )  .

184 Anschuetz , Wilshusen , and Scheick
Although vernacular knowledge is not a singular manifestation between cultures or even within specific cultures , certain cross-cultural regularities occur in
classificatory systems upon which common-sense beliefs are imposed . The importance of vernacular knowledge to landscape studies becomes clear with Nazarea ’ s
observation ,  “ The landscape , or what ’ s out there , is processed through human perception , cognition , and decision making before a plan or strategy is formulated
and an individual or collective action is executed ”  ( 1999b , p . 91 )  . Landscape , then , 
deals with every aspect of resource management that underlies a “ people ’ s sense
of place—the lenses through which they construct the environment and estimate
their latitudes of choice and opportunities for challenge and refutation ”  ( Nazarea , 
1999b , p . 105 )  . Because questions of the structure and organization of behavior
over time are focal archaeological interests , the varied material traces constituting
the archaeological record help define and evaluate past landscapes . 
Just as the natural environment , culture , tradition , and meanings assigned
to common-sense classificatory schema change over time . These characteristics
all are dynamic properties of human life ; they are neither static nor immutable . 
As Plog ( 1974 , pp . 8 , 9 , following Braidwood , 1968 and others ) argues , explaining change has been archaeology ’ s primary objective since the latter half of the
twentieth century . 
Although change is inevitable , the need to sustain order and coherence frame
the contingent variation of culture and its open-ended capacity for elaboration 
( Trigger , 1991 , p . 561 )  . Marked discontinuities in the archaeological record signifying either the breakdown or revolutionary overthrow of established cultural
frameworks that delimit certain ranges of behavior probably are rare . Instead , 
changes in historical landscape patterns for a particular cultural community will
most likely sustain fundamental structural and organizational continuities through
a community ’ s identifiable tradition . 
The question that remains is not whether landscape concepts are useful in
archaeology , or whether they comport with traditional archaeological practice , or
whether they can accommodate and address the postmodern critique . The question
is whether archaeology can contribute to a systematic , scientific explanation of
landscape dynamics over time . 
BUILDING AN ARCHAEOLOGY OF LANDSCAPES
Four major challenges to constructing an archaeology of landscapes exist . 
First , how does a landscape approach contribute to archaeological inquiry by
focusing attention on sources of behavioral variability characteristically obscured
by traditional archaeological space and time systematics ? Second , what are the
general assumptions behind , the validity of , and the limits to our understanding of the archaeology of landscapes ? Third , how do investigators reconcile—
or at least recognize—potential differences between traditional cultural views

and anthropology analyses of landscapes ? Fourth , how does landscape fit into
the larger challenge of making a scientifically viable , yet traditionally informed , 
anthropology ? 
Archaeological Systematics and Landscapes
If researchers conceive of “ landscape ” as a spatial analytical scale , they might
suggest that it serves to combine some of the integrative aspects of concepts such
as “ tradition ” and “ horizon .  ” For example , an archaeological landscape might be
viewed as the intersection of the spatial continuity of a particular cultural system ( i . e .  , an archaeological horizon ) within a specific temporal tradition . The
conceptualization of landscape simply as an analytical unit of scale is inappropriate , however . In most regions of the world , the most basic unit for defining the
intersection of the spatial extent of an archaeological horizon and the temporal
continuity of a tradition is a “ phase .  ” A phase in its most basic form represents the
local / regional expression of several occupation components . Although the spatial
extent of a phase or a horizon within a region is relevant to archaeological inquiry , 
this in itself does not constitute a “ landscape ” approach . 
A landscape approach is not isomorphic with space and time systematics . 
As cultural constructs that frame how people interact with their environments by
structuring perceptions and meanings , they incorporate both objective ( i . e .  , tangible and quantifiable in materialist terms ) resources and subjective ( i . e .  , less tangible
in materialist terms and thus more qualitative ) properties . Landscapes , after all , are
the dynamic interaction of nature and culture , not just a superficial imposition of
culture on nature . Each group introduces its own patterns of material and nonmaterial occupation , adding layers to the material traces of earlier or contemporary
use by other cultural groups ( Anschuetz et al .  , 1999 , p . 9 )  . 
Traditional archaeological space and time systematics characteristically view
cultural space as something bounded geographically and time as a linear progression . Phase analyses , and similar spatial–temporal analytical frameworks , stress
the material culture similarities of groups and tend to homogenize the remains
to form cultural signatures . Phase analyses are not particularly good at focusing attention on potentially contemporary cultural phenomena whose patterning
is conditioned in part by historically contingent processes based on contrasting
cultural perceptions , actions , and relationships . 
While the idea that culture is an open system is neither new nor foreign to
many archaeologists , common identifications of culture groups and culture areas in
narrowly defined typological criteria “ implicitly carry a closed concept of culture ”  
( Green and Perlman , 1985 , p . 6 )  . A landscape approach recognizes that the arenas
of human occupation and action are multilayered and that each group in a particular
physical setting imbues its own senses of place and time on that space regardless
of the purposes , frequency , or intensity of use .

Landscapes incorporate aspects of mythic , past , and current histories concurrently ; they have a quality of simultaneity . Because human actions and events
are not isolated happenings on the land , temporality and historicity merge in the
experiences of those who create order in their communities and reproduce society ( Ingold , 1993 , p . 157 ; see also Jackson , 1995 , p . 43 )  . People of culturally
diverse communities simultaneously can share spaces on the physical environment
with each drawing useful , but potentially contrasting , values ( both material and
nonmaterial ) from the places they perceive and signify . 
Landscape attributes of temporality and simultaneity make for a potentially
confusing temporal mix of material culture . A variety of studies over the past
two decades show that complex relationships exist among material culture traits , 
constructions of ethnicity or other group identity , and socioeconomic status ( e . g .  , 
Barrett , 1994 ; Braun and Plog , 1982 ; Bronitsky et al .  , 1985 ; Clark and Parry , 1990 ; 
Hodder , 1982 , 1985 , 1986 ; Longacre , 1991 ; Mills and Crown , 1995 ; Skibo et al .  , 
1995 )  . Importantly , boundaries can manifest themselves differently between the
domains of interpersonal behavior and the use , discard , and loss of material culture . 
Consequently , ideas of temporality and simultaneity require a shift in observational
and analytical scales . 
Although a landscape approach recognizes the inherent fluidity and permeability of narrowly delimited boundaries , the persistence of particular “ places ” 
within may serve to define a landscape . Archaeological information on qualitatively different economic tactics and strategies can serve to segregate contrasting
coresident groups . In this way , it is possible to recognize two or more communities occupying the same physical space through offsetting landscape constructions
that selectively favored qualitatively different ecological niches ( Anschuetz et al .  , 
1999 , p . 9 )  . 
The existence of interwoven , fluid cultural boundaries within a physical environment recalls the idea of borderlands or frontiers ( Gupta and Ferguson , 1992 ; 
Gupta et al .  , 1992 ) and ethnoscapes ( Appadurai , 1992 )  . Variation and change exhibited among broad historical patterns “ often is the most visible , and in some
cases most active , on the peripheries ”  ( Green and Perlman , 1985 , p . 9 ; see also
Cordell and Yannie , 1991 ; Feinman , 1994 ; Marcus , 1992 , 1998 ; Schortman and
Nakamura , 1991 )  . The concepts of borderlands and the indeterminacy of places
together are potentially productive guidelines for examining spatial , temporal , productive , organizational , and ideational variability among landscape constructions
of disparate communities within a common geographical area . 
In light of the many contextual nuances conditioning the temporal and spatial distributions of archaeological remains , we more appropriately may think of
landscapes in a fashion that traces the tactics and strategies underlying the occupation of geographic spaces that parallels the space and time systematics by Willey
and Phillips ( 1958 )  . Landscapes in this conceptualization are the intersection of a
particular group ’ s history with the places that define its spatial extent . In practice ,

Archaeology of Landscapes 187
researchers will recognize multiple cultural communities and possibly a variety
of ethnic or social groups within the “ landscapes ” they study . Consequently , archaeologists should anticipate the potential for multiple landscape histories to be
represented in the archaeological record . 
At first inspection , the many challenges to archaeological thought in the inherent multidimensionality and dynamics of landscapes may seem too formidable
to warrant use of a landscape approach . Nonetheless , when one considers the
many limitations imposed by traditional “ phase ” analyses , the potential merits of
a landscape approach suggest that we should not dismiss it prematurely . 
In adopting a landscape approach , the focus of archaeological study shifts to
isolating and dating the occupational histories of particular communities within a
given geographic space through the tactics and strategies they used to interact with
and survive in their environments . As we trace the trajectory of past community
development , we might be able to depict graphically , in a series of Venn diagrams , 
the various ways , including ecological , ritual , or ethnical ways , in which people
occupied their particular landscape . In short , a landscape approach complements
traditional archaeological space and time systematics through its processual and
scientific means of analysis while at the same time integrating human history and
agency into their constructions ( discussed later )  . 
Building an Epistemology for an Archaeology of Landscapes
Archaeology is but one part of a landscape paradigm . Archaeology alone
cannot address all parts of a truly integrative understanding of the anthropology
of place . An integrated comprehension of the cultural constructions of the environment , like other aspects of human behavior , must include attention to space
and time systematics . To build an epistemology for an archaeology of landscapes , 
there needs to be “ correspondences between a realm of knowledge , e . g .  , concepts
and propositions , and a realm of objects , e . g .  , experiences and things ”  ( Gregory , 
1994c , p . 168 , citing Hindess , 1977 , italics in original )  . Against this framework , 
we need to elucidate what is understood to be knowledge within this approach . 
Cultural anthropologists and archaeologists are well suited for making crosscultural comparisons . In terms of underlying time and space systematics , comparative studies by cultural anthropologists usually are synchronic and broadly
geographic . By virtue of their great time depth and diachronic perspective , archaeologists are making notable advances in explaining processes of cultural
change . Archaeologists , however , traditionally are less successful in identifying
and interpreting variation in the morphology and arrangement of behavior within
particular cultural systems , even at local scales ( e . g .  , see Binford , 1983 )  . 
A landscape paradigm holds the promise for archaeologists of focusing their
already considerable interpretive abilities along other productive research avenues . 
The approach facilitates identification and explication of the interactive processes

operating among the various economic , social , and ideational tactics and strategies
used by human groups as they sustain their livelihoods and communities in the face
of everchanging environmental conditions ( after Stone , 1993 , p . 78 )  . Through its
coherent framework , landscape considers that the variation observed in the physical
properties and spatial patterns of archaeological assemblages across spaces might
be part of a greater dynamic whole . 
The task is to identify and evaluate the context , morphology , and arrangement
of archaeological residues to explain human behavior and cultural processes . To
accomplish this goal , archaeologists need to attend to time and space systematics
within an increasingly integrative framework to examine how human communities
organized their day-to-day interactions with their environments . We need to view
material traces differently to enhance our pattern recognition skills and , ultimately , 
our explanatory abilities to achieve a higher level of historical ecological synthesis . Variation in the morphology and arrangement of archaeological assemblages
across physical space , rather than an absolute signature of cultural difference , 
might permit comprehension of the suite of tactics and strategies used by people to
retain resiliency in the face of unpredictable environmental conditions and sustain
the coherence with their cultural communities from one generation to the next . 
Two complementary groups of analytical units are necessary for the implementation of a comprehensive archaeological approach : archaeological and environmental ( Scheick et al .  , 2000 )  . Neither represents a departure from traditional
analytical units common in archaeological practice today . What differs is the careful attention to subdividing unit groups , measuring them , and designing analyses
to examine them . Archaeologists need methodologies for isolating , observing , and
measuring archaeological observations that ensure the data do not assume the very
behavioral processes they are interested in explaining . From these resulting information sets , we need to create analytical units relevant to archaeological and
physical landscape definition and landscape construction ( Scheick et al .  , 2000 )  . 
The archaeological landscape is the palimpsest of cultural residue that results from both natural and cultural processes operating at different spatial and
temporal scales ( see Wandsnider , 1998 , pp . 87 , 90 )  . As such , it represents a convoluted but patterned distribution of archaeological traces across space . The natural
environment is the sum of the biotic and geological elements within a particular
geographical space . Their spatial and temporal distributions determine the physical environment ’ s dynamic structure , which , in turn , helps to condition people ’ s
decision making and activities for sustaining their survival . 
The archaeological and environmental units identified for study are descriptors of the archaeological and physical landscapes , respectively . Variation in the
archaeological units represents , in part , the outcomes of choices made by groups
through their interactions with the physical spaces they occupied . The environmental units monitor some of the natural variation with which the people interacted . 
At the same time , the variation in natural environmental units helped structure the
group ’ s decision-making matrices and actions .

Archaeology of Landscapes 189
To construct an archaeology of landscapes , archaeologists must begin by
defining the natural and cultural parameters that differentially conditioned how
people occupied particular places and organized their activities across the dimensions of space and time ( Scheick et al .  , 2000 )  . By defining these parameters , we
can understand better the structure and organization of human actions within their
environments . Parameter definition involves four hierarchical steps :  ( 1 ) definition
of the archaeological and physical landscape segments that are the focus of our
studies ,  ( 2 ) identification of the linkages between these landscape segments ,  ( 3 ) 
establishment of their intersections , and ( 4 ) definition of the landscape through the
integration of these intersections . 
Through analyses , archaeologists need to characterize the internal variation
within their analytical units , examine the spatial variation between and among
those units , and identify and assess factors that might be responsible for some of
the observed variation ( after Scheick et al .  , 2000 )  . Through pattern recognition
and statistical analyses , we need to consider possible correspondences between
and among the analytical units and ultimately between the archaeological and
physical landscape segments . During this process , we might ( 1 ) define some of
the cultural and physical parameters that shaped landscape constructions within a
particular geographic space , and ( 2 ) identify and assess observable patterning that
links the archaeological and physical landscape segments . 
In documenting and assessing variation within and among the archaeological
analytical units , researchers can describe and evaluate the archaeological landscape comprehensively . In distinguishing between onsite and offsite components
of the archaeological record , we might discern areas of intensive and nonintensive land use , with the former representing occupied spaces on the land and the
latter representing activity spaces . Through study of spatial distributions and interrelationships among isolated archaeological traces , composite archaeological
assemblages , and nonmaterial open space , we might identify aspects of the archaeological landscape structure . Included in archaeological landscapes are ( 1 ) 
action spaces within which people focused their economic , social , and ideational
interactions with their environments ,  ( 2 ) search spaces within which people interact to fulfill particular needs , and ( 3 ) awareness spaces about which groups
maintain a minimal level of knowledge even though they might never visit the
places directly ( after Clark , 1998 , pp . 4 , 29 , 360 )  . Contributing further to archaeological landscape structure are the dynamic processes underlying the physical
landscape that operate on a variety of scales to affect what investigators see in the
contemporary archaeological record ( Wandsnider , 1998 )  .

less relevant to traditional communities concerned primarily with contemporary
social issues concerning their cultural survival ( Levine and Merlan , 1993 , p . 55 )  . 
For those archaeologists who work with traditional cultural properties ( e . g .  , Parker , 
1993 ; Parker and King , 1990 )  , there is much to recommend the concept of landscapes as way of linking the past with the present . Landscapes ( 1 ) are associated
with cultural practices or beliefs rooted in the histories of living communities and
are essential to sustaining cultural identities ( after Parker and King , 1990 ; see also
Parker , 1993 )  ,  ( 2 ) are shaped by people to serve their needs and reflect their culture 
( after Friedman , 1994 )  , and ( 3 ) simultaneously are viewed by people of different
cultural communities ( after Cowley , 1991 , 1994 )  . 
The “ language ” of landscapes is much more readily accessible to people from
traditional communities than the usual archaeological terminology used in scientific research or legislation designed to protect cultural resources , such as sites , and
traditional cultural properties , such as medicine gathering areas ( Anschuetz and
Scheick , 1999 ; Carroll , 1993 ; Cushman , 1993 ; Echo-Hawk , 1997 , 2000 ; Ferguson
et al .  , 1993 )  . To speak of past places as removed from the present and no longer
a part of contemporary landscapes makes little sense among people in traditional
knowledge systems . Many non-Western land-based communities view history as
part of a living process that makes the past a referent for the present and the
landscape as memory itself ( Anyon et al .  , 1997 ; K¨uchler , 1993 ; Morphy , 1993 ; 
see also Anschuetz et al .  , 2000 ; Ferguson et al .  , 1993 ; Jackson , 1980 ; Parker , 
1993 )  . Because landscape concepts held by the people of traditional communities characteristically are land based and process oriented , the landscape immediately is understood to be more than the present built environment ( Tallbull
and Deaver , 1997 ) or simply a protected cultural resources site ( Cleere , 1995 )  . 
Important sources of knowledge from the past about the material consequences
of how people used , occupied , and transformed their landscapes are embedded
in each community ’ s cultural–historical narratives . History is continuously reenacted in the present through the group ’ s traditional beliefs and practices , thereby
continually reaffirming the community ’ s cultural–historical associations with its
landscapes ( after Parker , 1993 , p . 4 )  . Landscapes , in turn , become a mirror of a
community . Landscapes are products of communities ’ relationships with their
surroundings , as each generation lives its life and bestows meaning on those
surroundings . 
As archaeologists , it is important also to consider the past in terms of indigenous peoples , not just of our discipline . Comprehension that the physical spaces , 
including tracts of rangeland , surrounding built residential centers are neither natural nor exclusively part of nature is an indispensable first step . A landscape ’ s
physical spaces are not silent on questions of community history and cultural
heritage . 
Although a landscape approach is not a complete bridge by itself , it facilitates active dialogue between the traditional groups with ties to a place and the

archaeologists working in the locality . Such dialogue presupposes the recognition
that landscape includes both quantifiable archaeological resources ( i . e .  , artifacts , 
features , and sites ) and cultural properties ( i . e .  , qualitative characteristics people
associate with and use to sustain their conceptual occupation of places and community identity )  . Many places exist that qualify as traditionally important cultural
properties or significant archaeological resources ( or both ) whose management
should be parts of a larger landscape . The ethic of place ( Wilkinson , 1992 , pp . 
132–161 ) and anthropology of place ( shown earlier ) might be a vital point of
overlap for traditional communities concerned with their cultural survival and
contemporary archaeology . 
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS : LANDSCAPES , 
ANTHROPOLOGICAL ARCHAEOLOGY , AND EXPLAINING
THE PAST
The terminological and methodological eclecticism in the present use of landscape in archaeological analyses appears to result from researchers attempting to
solve many different kinds of problems in isolation , using a concept whose paradigmatic underpinnings have yet been fully defined . An archaeology of landscapes
has the promise for bridging some nagging problems in archaeology by providing a set of interdisciplinary methodologies that accommodate , if not integrate , 
contrasting theoretical perspectives . 
Because landscapes are worlds of cultural product and represent the record
of dynamic processes of human interaction with their environments , they warrant
further consideration . A landscape approach provides a framework for assessing
sources of behavioral variability in the archaeological record and allow observations in a context beyond the limits of the physical locations and boundaries of
sites . The approaches emphasize the contextualization of onsite findings in terms
of the open spaces among the activity remnants observed archaeologically and that
people almost certainly moved through and used during their daily activities ( after Morrow , 1997 , p . 161 )  . Through a landscape approach , researchers can frame
questions on how the morphology and arrangement of archaeological materials
represent either a design with or an imposition on nature ( after McHarg , cited in
Price 1997 , p . 227 )  . The spatial and temporal distributions of archaeological assemblages can be used to evaluate changes in the patterning of cultural traditions
as realignments of behavior . 
Because material culture encodes information in patterned ways , the use of
inductive methods can decode archaeological observations to help make inferences
about past meanings that underlie observed regularities and deviations ( Rapoport , 
1990 , p . 86 )  . By combining a landscape approach with traditional spatial and
temporal systematics , it is possible to incorporate the dynamic scale of landscape

analysis with the fine-scaled spatial and temporal analysis of patterns characteristic
of traditional archaeological practice . 
Common archaeological techniques , such as settlement pattern , distributional , historical , social formation , and symbolic analyses , all can contribute toward
the building of a landscape approach . Each may offer partial answers to the larger
questions the landscape paradigm enables us to ask . Current research on settlement
ecology , ritual landscapes , and ethnic landscapes offers glimpses into the potential power of a landscape approach . Such an integrative methodological approach
might facilitate examination of issues such as ritual use and ethnic identity that are
assuming prominence in archaeological inquiry . Because a landscape is the arena
for all of a group ’ s economic , social , and ideational behavior , studies under this
approach must consider within-place and between-place contexts . Moreover , that
landscapes are dynamic constructions necessitates a more comprehensive search
for patterning and development of holistic explanations in which people as actors
contribute to changes in their conditions for living . 
The twentieth century ideas of Sauer and Jackson still have currency . Landscape truly might be “ the pattern which connects ”  ( Bateson , 1978 ) seemingly
disparate constructs . Landscape enables us to perceive and comprehend the great
breadth and interdependency among the parts forming the heterarchical web of
people ’ s interactions with their environments . 
Archaeology , as an integral part of anthropology and armed with its great time
depth , has the potential to unify this truly interdisciplinary approach into a coherent
whole . In doing so , a landscape paradigm might allow archaeology to contribute
substantively to an understanding of the anthropology of place by demonstrating
the limits of strict cultural materialism in explaining how people creatively fashion
their environments .
