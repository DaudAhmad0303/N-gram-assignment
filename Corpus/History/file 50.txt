11: Discussion
11.1: Chapter Aims
This the final chapter of the thesis seeks to ascertain whether the evidence presented within 
conforms to what we currently know of oppida, particularly in the cases of Colchester, 
Titelberg, and Canterbury. In doing this, thought will be given to whether the inferences drawn 
suggest that the continued use of this term is limiting our understanding of these sites and their 
contemporaneous settlements also labelled thus. In other words, does the term oppida overlook 
the individual nuances of these sites, in order to use an all-encompassing term that could be 
argued to limit the need for in-depth independent analysis if a site displays one or more of the 
characteristics identified as ‘key’ to the classification of oppida during the 1970s and 1980s 
(see Chapter 2)? By considering these points, the author will not only be bringing together all 
aspects of the thesis, but will be meeting the aims of the current project (Chapter 1.2).
Endeavouring to meet the purported aims of the thesis, while also bringing together the key 
aspects of the paper, the author engaged in a study of four parts:
1. An overview of the key characteristics of each of the thesis’ case studies, coupled with 
a consideration of how well they compare to one another.
2. A consideration of how these characteristics compare with current thinking on oppida.
3. A comparative study within which occupation at the thesis’ case sites was compared to 
that at some of the period’s better known oppida.
4. A consideration of whether the thesis’ case sites and comparative oppida can be said to 
share commonalities with contemporaneous non-oppida1
; with particular thought being 
given to these sites’ social, economic, and power connotations, those themes to which 
oppida are closely tied (see Chapters 2-5).
Hence, this was a study designed to determine the relevance of the term ‘oppida’ today when
applied to Colchester, Titelberg, and Canterbury; as well as their contemporaries. In doing this 
the author aimed to ensure that any issues with its continued use were clearly highlighted and 
founded within a secure body of evidence. 
 
1 Non-oppida are defined as those settlements that have never been considered oppida within the literature; in 
other words, these are farmsteads, villages, and open settlements (see Chapter 3.3).
462
The results borne out of the study outlined above are presented below following the author’s 
chronological phasing of the later Iron Age (see Chapter 6.1). This approach was adopted 
because occupation at these sites was fluid, meaning that the nature of occupation at Colchester, 
Titelberg, and Canterbury during Period 1 was not necessarily reflected in later periods of their
use. Consequently, by employing this structure the author was not only able to engage in a 
more in-depth study of the relevance of the term oppida, but ascertain whether it could be 
argued that the term continues to have some relevance for sites of a specific date and/or 
geographic location.
11.2: Period 1: 150/100 – 55/50 BC
11.2.1: Period 1 within the context of the later Iron Age
This timeframe is typically represented, both sides of the Channel, by agrarian societies who
obtained that which they could not procure locally, through a combination of social and 
economic exchanges (Nash 1984, 95-96). These exchanges were generally founded upon the 
generation of surplus (ibid, 95-96), as was usually the case for this period (see Chapter 4.1); 
and typically took place between kin groups who engaged in the mutual trade of foodstuffs and 
other essential raw materials (Nash 1984, 96) (see also Chapters 4.1, 4.3). 
Furthermore, this period is also portrayed as one of change. At this time, large areas of Britain 
were characterised by: increasing population numbers (Cunliffe 1995a, 26) and, as a result of 
these, a more advanced social structure comprising proto-states presided over by kings 
(Champion et al. 1992, 316; Collis 1984b, 145; Mattingly, 2007, 56; Nash 1976; 1978); an 
economy that was centred on the generation of surplus from mixed farming regimes (Millett 
1990, 10), but saw an increased focus on products generated through industrial processes due 
to a number of technological advancements in this field, most notably the introduction of the 
potter’s wheel (Collis 1984b, 162; Cunliffe 1984, 9; Mattingly 2007. 56); increased contact 
with the near Continent (Collis 1984b, 162; Cunliffe 1984, 4-5; Mattingly 2007. 56), that not 
only gave rise to Mediterranean goods in Britain (Cunliffe 1984, 4-5; 1995, 60), but socioeconomic relationships between Essex, Kent, and their Gallo-Belgic neighbours (Cunliffe 
1995a, 64)(see also Chapter 4); and the emergence of a cremation based burial rite in the southeast that resembled that which existed in both northern Gaul and western Rhineland at this time 
(Collis 1984b, 162). 
463
Meanwhile, in some areas of Temperate Europe, but particularly Gaul, this period of 
occupation was characterised by its organisation into tribal ‘states’/proto-states presided over 
by kings (Champion et al. 1992, 316; Collis 1984b, 145; Nash 1976; 1978); numerous 
economic advancements, particularly in iron- and bronze-working, the production of jewellery, 
coinage and other small artefacts, carpentry, leather working, and pottery production 
(Champion et al. 1992, 309; Collis 1976, 10-12; Jacobi 1974; Wyss 1974), that were 
accompanied by technological advancements such as the introduction of the potter’s wheel 
(Champion et al. 1992, 300, 305-306; Wells 2001, 93; 2002, 369), and advancements in kiln
technology (Champion et al. 1992, 305); the standardisation of both pottery (Kappel 1969; 
Maier 1970 cf. Champion et al. 1992, 306) and brooch (Champion et al. 1992, 306; Wells 2001, 
93) forms; and the rekindling of economic relationships with the Mediterranean World 
(Champion et al. 1992, 308-309; Cunliffe 1995a, 59-60; Fulford 1985, 94; Wells 2001, 96).
For the purposes of the current chapter, in particular the first three parts of the study outlined 
above (see page 461), it is the changes witnessed both sides of the Channel in settlement 
patterns that are arguably the most pertinent. In c.150/100 BC there were five types of 
settlement in use across much of Britain: ‘strongly defended homesteads, hillforts, villages, 
open settlements, and enclosed homesteads’ (Cunliffe 1995a, Fig.3); by the end of Period 1 
hillforts had more or less ceased to be occupied (Mattingly 2007, 56) with people instead 
preferring to inhabit defended/enclosed farmsteads and newly emerging types of agglomerated 
settlement including: trading ports and low-lying foci, or oppida as they are more commonly 
referred (ibid, 56). Within Temperate Europe, on-the-other-hand, the settlement pattern at the 
beginning of this period comprised small and/or open villages and farmsteads and some hilltop 
enclosure sites (Collis 1984b, 145; Wells 2001, 85). Over the course of Period 1 this changed, 
and led to the emergence of two new types of settlement. Firstly, the so-called oppida, which 
emerged from Gaul in the west to Hungary in the east (Champion et al. 1992, 306; FernándezGötz 2014a; 380; Kappel 1969; Maier 1970; Wells 2001, 84-85; 2002, 366); and secondly, a 
series of ‘much smaller unenclosed settlements’ (Wells 2001, 85). Consequently, it is against 
the backdrop of these changing settlement patterns that the beginnings of later Iron Age
occupation at Colchester, Titelberg, and Canterbury took place.
464
11.2.2: Period 1 occupation at the thesis’ case sites
11.2.2.1: Colchester
Period 1 occupation at Colchester was difficult to verify within the archaeological record; 
comprising only an enclosure at The Garrison dated to between 75 and 25 BC by a vessel 
recovered within the roundhouse at its heart (see Chapter 7.3.1), 14 Dressel 1 amphorae, and 8 
coins from the Roman republic (see Chapter 7.3.1.1). Despite this limited evidence, the author 
speculated that should Colchester have been occupied at all at this time Sheepen was used as 
both a port and religious centre, whilst The Garrison functioned as a farmstead that may also 
have fulfilled a religious role (see Chapter 7.3.1.3). Furthermore, it was speculated during the 
analysis process that the amphorae signified the existence of an elite population at Colchester
and/or the hosting of communal events that fostered social cohesion (see Chapter 7.3.1.2); 
while the coinage may have been a symbol of relationships forged for social and/or economic 
gain (see Chapters 6.2.4, 7.3.1.2).
11.2.2.2: Titelberg
Period 1 occupation at Titelberg, unlike that which occurred at Colchester, was very visible 
within the archaeological record, comprising: 85 morphological entities (see Figure 9.12; 
Appendix 9.9), 443 ceramic vessels (see Figure 9.13; Appendix 9.10), and 59 additional 
artefacts (see Figures 9.14-9.15; Appendix 9.11). Using this evidence the author determined 
that the site was used for a combination of domestic occupation, farming regimes, and the 
industrial production of both coinage and pottery (see Chapters 9.3.1.2-9.3.1.3). In addition to 
this, the enclosed eastern area of the site functioned as somewhere the site’s residents and 
neighbouring communities could come together to observe religious events (see Chapters 9.2, 
9.3.1.2).
Furthermore, the author ascertained that Titelberg’s population was differentiated at this time
in terms of the roles individuals fulfilled, (see Chapter 9.3.1.3); comprising farmers, 
blacksmiths, bronze-smiths, potters, weavers, religious figures, and merchants. Additionally, 
it was surmised that this population was stratified, as evidenced by a number of the imported 
wares attributed to this period (see Chapter 9.3.1.2). Moreover, it was not just members of 
Titelberg’s population that had power during this period, but the site itself, as ascertained 
through a consideration of the locally produced coinage (see Chapters 9.3.1.2-9.3.1.3).
465
Many of the aforementioned points can also be said to have led to the inference that the site 
was relatively self-sustaining, and used surplus commodities from its industries to obtain those 
goods that could not be produced locally, as well as imports from both the Mediterranean world 
and elsewhere in Gaul (see Chapter 9.3.1.2; Figures 9.20-9.21, 9.23-9.24; Appendices 9.10-
9.11). An analysis of these imports provided further insight into the stratified nature of 
Titelberg’s population by highlighting those goods that were used by the elite to demonstrate 
their social standing (see Chapter 9.3.1.2).
These use of the Lamadelaine cemetery at this time, evidenced by an extensive archaeological 
record comprising a rich ceramic assemblage (see Figure 9.16; Appendix 9.12) and wide array 
of grave goods (see Figure 9.17; Appendix 9.13) allowed the author to surmise that death was 
a communal event designed to honour both the deceased and those deities looked to at such 
times (see pages 320-324). Furthermore, a study of this cemetery also confirmed notions that 
Titelberg was occupied by a stratified community whose occupant’s daily lives centred on 
traditional Iron Age activities (see pages 324-327).
11.2.2.3: Canterbury
Some areas of the Canterbury region were extensively occupied during Period 1, with this c.100 
year period witnessing the use of at least four areas: Bigbury, Marlowe Car-park, St Edmund’s 
School, and Turing College (see Chapter 10.3.1.1). It is however, curious to note that the 
archaeological record associated with this occupation was not as vast as one might have 
expected (see Chapter 10.3.1; Appendices 10.7-10.8)
2
; although, this is probably due to the fact 
that recent work at the latter of these sites has yet to be fully published (see page 409). Despite 
this, there was much available for analysis (see Chapter 10.3.1.1).
An analysis of the aforementioned dataset led the author to deduce that the site was used for a 
combination of domestic occupation, farming regimes, and craft production (see Chapter 
10.3.1.2). The latter of these activities included metalworking and the production of both 
ceramics and textiles (see pages 411-412; Appendix 10.9). Consequently, the author surmised 
that the site was relatively self-sustaining, and as such, able to obtain that which they could not 
 
2
It should also be noted that the majority of those regions occupied during the later Iron Age have been built over 
in the intervening c.2000 years. Consequently, archaeological explorations of this period are fraught with 
problems, not least because the opportunity to reach the depth required to explore Iron Age deposits are rare.
466
manufacture themselves using surplus generated through craft and/or farming practices (see 
pages 410-412). 
Furthermore, the author surmised that the Canterbury region had close economic ties to its 
hinterland, through the presence of ceramics produced in Kent, but not Canterbury itself (see 
page 412). The presence of some, though not many, continental imports (see Appendix 10.8), 
on-the-other-hand, gave rise to the inference that the site’s population may have been stratified, 
as well as the notion that Canterbury’s occupants may have used imports during communal 
events designed to foster social cohesion (see page 413).
In addition to the above, it is important to note that Canterbury’s occupants, particularly those 
residing at Bigbury, may have used slaves as a means through which to obtain imported goods, 
as well as surplus local products (see page 413). An inference that is based upon the discovery 
of slave shackles and an associated padlock at Bigbury (see Appendix 10.9); further supporting
the idea that Canterbury’s Period 1 population was stratified.
11.2.3: A series of comparisons
11.1.3.1: A comparison of occupation at the thesis’ case sites
When comparing the nature of occupation at Colchester, Titelberg, and Canterbury it became 
quickly apparent to the author that although there was some overlap in terms of the activities 
being conducted at these sites, they were not as similar as their categorisation as oppida might 
lead us to believe. With regards to the former of these observations, the first aspect to note is 
that all three sites were used for a combination of domestic occupation, farming practices, and 
craft production. Furthermore, they all produced evidence to suggest that they received goods 
from the near Continent as a result of revived trading relationships between Gaul and the 
Mediterranean World, a process that appears to have led to a visualisation of stratified 
communities at each of these settlements. However, when we take a closer look at these 
activities it becomes evident that there are subtle differences that can be said to set these sites 
apart.
Firstly, and most noticeably, Titelberg and Canterbury received far greater use than Colchester
during Period 1. Moreover, while Titelberg and Canterbury were probably receiving imported 
goods in exchange for surplus grain and/or the commodities manufactured by local craftsmen, 
artefacts of this nature at Colchester are likely to have arrived at the site, at least in part, because 
467
of its position as a port. It seems, therefore, that Titelberg and Canterbury may have shared 
more in common with each other than they did with Colchester at this time. 
However, when we take into account the fact that both Colchester and Titelberg fulfilled 
religious purposes yet no evidence to this end has been identified at Canterbury, (at least in so 
far as excavations have yet to reveal one3
), the extent to which this observation can be 
considered convincing is limited. Conversely, it is not only the apparent absence of a religious 
centre at Canterbury, and minimal use of Colchester that can be said to limit the extent to which 
these sites compare to Titelberg, because Titelberg also appears to have had more ‘worth’ 
within its wider landscape than either Colchester or Canterbury during Period 1. This 
observation is founded not only upon the notion that Titelberg was occupied/used to a greater 
extent than the other two sites at this time, but the fact that it was used to mint its region’s 
coinage, and therefore likely enjoyed a position of regional power. Consequently, it can be 
said that while there were some similarities between the thesis’ case sites during Period 1, it is 
clear that there were also considerable differences; and that these differences characterise the 
nuances of these sites, and the activities they supported, at this time.
11.2.3.2: How does occupation at the thesis’ case sites compare to current thinking on oppida?
As so-called oppida, we would expect Colchester, Titelberg, and Canterbury to comply with 
current thinking on what makes a site warrant the label oppidum, (see Chapter 2); and it is to a 
consideration of this that our attentions now turn.
In light of the comparison of occupation at the case sites conducted above, (Chapter 11.1.3.1), 
the author entered into the current study with the mind-set that there were likely many areas 
where the use of the term ‘oppida’ has over generalised4
considerations of occupation at sites 
such as Colchester, Titelberg, and Canterbury, and in doing so misrepresented their true nature. 
This is a preconception that was proven true not only through the present study, but those which 
follow it. 
 
3
It is of course important to remember that religious structures of this date are notoriously difficult to identify.
4 By ‘over generalised’ the author means that existing interpretations of oppida may have focused on those aspects 
of occupation at the oppida that we have come to expect them to display, as well as those features that ultimately 
led to them being placed within this class of settlement (see Chapter 2), and not on the site’s individuality in terms 
of their functions and what might set them apart from their contemporaries.
468
Chapter 2 of the thesis detailed current thinking on oppida and in doing so provided a coherent 
image of what many today perceive the character of these sites to have been. Arguably, one of 
the most prominent interpretations of the so-called oppida is that they were large fortified urban 
centres that show signs of long distance trade and/or industry (see Chapters 2.2, 2.3). In order 
to ensure that this point-of-view, and how well it compares to the author’s interpretations of 
Colchester, Titelberg, and Canterbury, is thoroughly explored, we must first define what we 
mean by the term ‘urban’. Traditionally ‘urban’ is: something ‘relating to, or constituting a 
town or city’ (Collins 2000, 1675). However, as Iron Age settlements can rarely be considered 
towns or cities, (see Chapter 1.2.1), we as archaeologists are more likely to refer to the term 
‘urbanism’ when demonstrating what we mean by ‘urban’, because this term by its very nature 
is defined by the physical attributes we would expect to find at urban centres, attributes that 
include: evidence of settlement planning, a large area of occupation, and the presence of both 
religious and political foci alongside residential areas (Darvill 2003, 448); in other words they 
would meet the criterion of early Roman towns in Gaul (see Chapter 1.2.1). 
When considering the above criterion of oppida in conjunction with interpretations of 
occupation at Colchester, Titelberg, and Canterbury (Chapters 7, 9-10; Chapter 11.2.2), it
became clear that there were several areas where current thinking on these sites complied little 
with the purported characteristics of oppida; however, this is not to say that there was not some 
cohesion. If we first consider the notion that these settlements, as so-called oppida, should 
have covered relatively large expanses of land and been fortified (see Chapter 2.2), a problem 
with this aspect of their classification emerges straight away. While all three sites appear to 
have covered considerable tracts of land, particularly Colchester and Canterbury whose centres 
of occupation were fairly well dispersed within the Essex and Kentish landscapes respectively, 
only Titelberg has thus far5
produced evidence of this date to suggest that it was fortified; 
although Bigbury, at Canterbury, was in itself enclosed by a significant ditch and bank rampart. 
The lack of fortifications at Colchester, and most of Canterbury, is vitally important to the 
authors’ fulfilment of the thesis’s aims, because, over the years the presence of fortifications is 
one characteristic of the so-called oppida that has never waivered (Woolf 1993a, 225). In other 
words, for a site to be classified as an oppidum it invariably needs to have been defined by 
 
5 That is to say future explorations at Canterbury and Colchester might yet reveal evidence for fortifications dating 
to between 150/100 and 55/50 BC.
469
earthworks that would have enclosed the majority of its occupied space and in some cases 
served a defensive function. 
Our attention now turns to a consideration of whether Colchester, Titelberg, and Canterbury 
had urban characteristics. One of the first characteristics archaeologists look for in potential 
urban centres is a large area of occupied land, something, as was noted above, that all three of 
our settlements possess. Additionally, we would expect to find evidence of a settlement plan, 
primarily in the form of formalised street grids, which none of the case sites possessed at this 
time. Finally, urban centres, such as the so-called oppida, are presumed to have possessed both 
political and ritual foci alongside domestic occupation. 
Colchester, Titelberg, and Canterbury have all produced convincing evidence for domestic 
occupation over the course of Period 1, (although it could be argued this was more evident at 
Titelberg and Canterbury than Colchester); and whilst both Titelberg and Colchester certainly 
had a religious focus, with the former being more closely situated near domestic occupation 
than the latter, (at Colchester potential domestic occupation was situated at The Garrison while 
the site’s religious focus was at Sheepen), there is currently no evidence to this end linked to 
Canterbury. 
Finally, for a settlement to be considered ‘urban’ it must also display evidence of a political 
focus6
. Based on the evidence compiled and analysed in conjunction with Period 1 occupation 
at Colchester, Titelberg, and Canterbury it can be said that only Titelberg may have had a 
political focus during Period 1; an interpretation that is based upon the site’s connection to the 
production of the Treveri’s coinage at this time. Consequently, neither Colchester nor 
Canterbury can be said to have been ‘urban’ during Period 1, as they lack at least three of the 
five characteristics sought of sites. In the case of Titelberg, on-the-other-hand, a case could be 
made that the site was ‘urban’ as it is only missing a formalised street plan. However, as it is 
likely oversights such as this, that is overlooking the absence of one or two of the characteristics 
expected of oppida, that have led to the confusion associated with this term today, the author 
feels it would be wrong to consider Titelberg wholly ‘urban’ between 150/100 and 55/50 BC, 
and instead suggests that we do not consider any of the case sites to have met this criterion.
 
6 A political focus can be identified archaeological in a number a ways, as can be seen from see Chapter 2.3.5.
470
In addition to the above, current thinking on oppida tells us that these sites were also centres 
of industry and/or long distance trade (see Chapters 2.2, 2.3). We would therefore expect to 
find considerable evidence at potential oppida for one or both of these processes. At 
Colchester, Titelberg, and Canterbury there is evidence of imported wares, and therefore 
evidence to suggest that their occupants may have engaged in long distance trade. At 
Colchester evidence for long distance trade exists in the form of 14 Dressel 1 amphorae and 8 
Republican coins that likely entered the site through the port at Sheepen whose merchants had 
forged links with their Gallic counterparts (see Chapter 7.3.1.2). Similarly, evidence of this 
activity at Canterbury is also represented by Dressel 1 amphorae; however, in this case the 
vessels were likely obtained from a trading post in the site’s hinterland, rather than directly 
from the continent as this was likely the most efficient manner in which to obtain imports (see 
page 413). At Titelberg meanwhile, there is evidence for a number of imported wares, 
including both ceramics (see Figures 9.20-9.21; Appendix 9.10) and brooches (see Figure 9.24; 
Appendix 9.11), that likely reached the site directly from a trading centre elsewhere in Gaul 
(see pages 316-317). Consequently, although there is evidence for imports at all three of the 
thesis’ case sites, but particularly Colchester and Titelberg, that may have been obtained 
through long distance trade, the number of imports circulating at Colchester, Titelberg, and 
Canterbury during Period 1 is minimal and arguably not enough to suggest that this activity
was a primary practice for occupants of these sites. Were they then centres of industry? 
As was the case with long distance trade one would expect industry to be well represented 
within these sites’ archaeological record if this practice was one of their primary functions. At 
Colchester industrial processes have only been inferred through our knowledge that domestic 
craft production tended to take place alongside domestic occupation and farming regimes (see 
Chapter 7.3.1.2); therefore, this site cannot be said to have functioned as either a centre of long 
distance trade or an industrial hub at this time. Canterbury, on-the-other-hand, does have the 
potential to be viewed as an industrial centre as both Bigbury and Turing College have provided 
evidence to suggest that their occupants engaged in a range of industrial processes including 
blacksmithing, the production of textiles and ceramics, and potentially also small scale bronzesmithing (see Chapters 10.3.1.2-10.3.1.3; Appendix 10.5). However, as many of these goods
were produced for the purposes of local consumption as well as to ensure that the site’s 
occupants could gain access to items Canterbury’s occupants would have used on a daily basis, 
such as a broader range of ceramics than were produced at Turing College, and brooches for 
which there is no evidence of local production at present, one has to wonder whether the 
471
production of these goods was actually a matter of necessity rather than as an identifying 
feature of the site; because without the generation of exports it is possible that Canterbury 
would not have been able reproduce itself, and develop into the flourishing centre of activity it 
became over the course of the later Iron Age. 
In contrast to the above, there is much evidence to suggest that one of Titelberg’s primary 
functions during Period 1 was to act as an industrial centre. This site shows signs of not only 
producing metalwork and ceramics at this time (see Figures 4.23, 4.24), but some of the
region’s coinage (see Chapter 9.3.1.2). Furthermore, the fact that the ‘Foundation House’, a 
specialised building used for the production of coinage and a range of other metal artefacts, 
emerged in its first incarnation during Period 1 tells us that there was a conscious decision by 
the site’s occupants to ensure that they were able to meet the demands put on their industries. 
Consequently, the author feels that of the thesis’ three case studies only Titelberg convincingly 
displays evidence of the final primary characteristic expected of oppida.
The interpretations of oppida discussed above are, however, not the only ones to exist within 
the literature pertaining to these sites. From Chapter 2, it is evident that in addition to the above 
many also perceive these sites to have been centres of power and/or ceremony, or even central 
foci within their respective landscapes. In being centres of power, potential oppida are 
expected to have fulfilled administrative and other political tasks, comprised tribal/elite 
residences, or a combination of both of these (see Chapters 2.3.4-2.3.5; Table 2.4). Meanwhile, 
those who characterise these sites as ceremonial believe that they were used for religious events 
and/or as funerary complexes; although, others have argued that their ceremonial function may 
have lain with their use as places for public gatherings designed to foster social cohesion (see 
Table 2.4). Finally, the notion that these sites were central places saw them depicted as 
settlements to which their hinterland were apparently beholden for success (see Table 2.4). 
When contemplating whether the thesis’ case sites adhere to the above characteristics, the first 
thing to note with regards to them being potential centres of power is that part of this defining 
function has already been considered. In being centres of power oppida are believed to have 
been used to fulfil administrative and other political roles, therefore they are expected to have 
been political foci. When the author explored the possibility of the case sites displaying urban 
characteristics they had to ascertain whether Colchester, Titelberg, and Canterbury served as 
political foci during Period 1. In doing this it was determined that only Titelberg met with this 
472
expectation, because it was used as a mint for its region’s coinage at this time; a process that 
was likely controlled by a central administration. 
In terms of whether Colchester, Titelberg, and Canterbury can be considered tribal centres 
and/or elite residences, Titelberg can be said to have more in common with the so-called oppida
than either Colchester or Canterbury; however, this is only true in so far as this site can be 
considered a tribal centre. One can label Titelberg thus because of its connection to the Treveri, 
(the tribe associated with this region of Gaul (see Chapter 9.3.1)), and the fact that it was 
responsible for minting a proportion of their coinage (see page 317-320). At Colchester and 
Canterbury, on-the-other-hand, no evidence, such as coinage, for the tribes regularly associated 
with these sites, the Trinovantes, (Dunnet 1975), and Cantiaci, (Detsicas 1983) respectively, is 
visible within their Period 1 archaeological records.
Finally, as centres of power oppida are expected to have contained an elite residence. 
Although, all three of the thesis’ case sites appear to display evidence of stratified populations, 
none of them can be said to have been elite residences. An inference that is founded upon the 
notion that, while there is evidence for potential conspicuous consumption at all three sites,
and therefore individuals of power, there is not enough of this material present to suggest that 
Colchester, Titelberg, and Canterbury were primarily elite residences. Had these sites been 
elite residences we might expect to see more in the way of luxury products, evidence that points 
towards a recognised leader, such as the coinage bearing an individual’s name recovered in 
Britain, and possibly even a residence that stands out from others present either because it is 
larger or self-contained. 
The next aspect of a site’s characterisation as an oppidum to be considered here is their 
purported role as ceremonial centres. Part of the thesis’ case sites adherence to this function 
has been considered above in relation to whether they contained religious foci; consequently, 
it can be said that only Colchester and Titelberg likely fulfilled this role. Further to this, oppida, 
as ceremonial centres, are expected to have been used for/be associated with a funerary 
complex; although, this is likely only expected of oppida in south-east Britain and Northern 
Gaul, because elsewhere in Temperate Europe funerary complexes are rare (see Chapter 2.3.5).
Of the thesis’ three case sites, only Titelberg can be said to have potentially satisfied this 
requisite of oppida. However, the author feels that despite Titelberg’s association with the 
473
cemetery of Lamadelaine during Period 1, (see pages 320-327), we have to wonder whether it 
can be labelled a funerary complex. The author raises this doubt because the burials are not 
within the main confines of the settlement but situated on the northern slopes of its plateau, 
(see Figures 9.1-9.4, 9.11), and they feel that if an oppidum was a funerary complex the burials 
would be situated prominently within its main confines. It can therefore be said that none of 
the case sites wholly conform to this definition of oppida.
The last characteristic sought in oppida labelled ceremonial centres, is evidence for their use 
as centres where communal ceremonies designed to foster social cohesion were hosted. 
Identifying communal activities, such as those referred to here, is particularly difficult because 
the traces they leave within the archaeological record closely resemble those associated with
traditional/typical activities conducted during the later Iron Age. However, this is not to say 
that it is impossible. For the most part, evidence of communal activities, such as these, is likely 
to comprise feasting debris located in/close to areas large enough to house a sizable population, 
in fact this evidence is likely to resemble that attributed to ritual/religious activities. It is for 
this reason that the author surmised that of the three case sites Colchester and Titelberg are 
those mostly likely to have been used for communal ceremonies, as these sites’ religious zones 
likely had dual purpose (see Chapters 7.3.1.2, 9.3.1.2). 
Finally, our consideration of how well Period 1 occupation at Colchester, Titelberg, and 
Canterbury compares to current thinking on oppida turns to a contemplation of whether they 
can be considered central places. Of these sites only Colchester has been referred to as a central 
place within the literature (see Table 2.4); in light of this, the author engaged in a study of sites 
comprising Colchester’s hinterland that have produced evidence of contemporaneous 
occupation (see Chapter 8). An analysis of these sites’, (Ardleigh, Kelvedon, and Elms Farm, 
Heybridge), Period 1 occupation revealed that they were almost as sparsely occupied as 
Colchester itself at this time, despite being used for a range of different activities, including
domestic occupation, farming, and craft production (see pages 235-237, 247-249, 263-264). 
This analysis led the author to conclude that Colchester’s hinterland sites were relatively selfsufficient and able to obtain that which they could not produce themselves without needing to 
go through Colchester (see pages 237, 249, 265). Consequently, the author surmised that 
Colchester was not a central node to which Ardleigh, Kelvedon, and Elms Farm were beholden 
(see Chapter 8.4), but rather a settlement with which they had social, and possible economic, 
relationships of a similar calibre to those they likely had with the smaller sites within their own 
474
hinterlands. As such it can be said that these sites highlight a break with the old convention of 
central-place/core-periphery models in their relationship to Colchester at this time. 
Overall, it can be said that current thinking on the defining characteristics of oppida, (see 
Chapter 2), is only applicable to Colchester, Titelberg, and Canterbury to a degree at this stage 
of their development. In the case of the former and latter sites there are far more differences 
than similarities between the nature of their occupation and that which we have come to expect 
at oppida. Titelberg, on-the-other-hand, can be said to share much more in common with 
current thinking on oppida at this time; however, even this site does not wholly comply with 
this thinking, and therefore the author is unwilling to concede that this site can indeed be 
referred to as such. Consequently, this comparative study can be said to highlight the need to 
reassess the relevance of the term oppida today; a conclusion that is based on the fact that only 
Titelberg comes close to complying with current thinking on these sites; as well as the 
observation that, despite this class of settlement being portrayed as more or less uniform, (see 
Chapter 2), there are only two areas where the nature of the thesis’ case sites overlap: their size 
and the fact that they were all to some extent used for domestic occupation. It can, therefore,
be said that the continued use of the term ‘oppida’ could result in the true nature of sites 
categorised as such being overlooked, simply because they display one or more of the same 
characteristics as those sites which do fit within this category. The relevance of this term can 
thus be said to have waned; however, it is not judicious to base these conclusions on this study 
alone, one must also consider how well the thesis’ case sites compare to some of Period 1s best 
known oppida, including: Bibracte, Corent, Manching, Stradonice, Staré Hradisko, and Závist.
11.2.3.3: A comparison of the thesis’ case sites and Period 1’s best known oppida
In recent years, Wells has stated that Bibracte, Manching, Stradonice, and Staré Hradisko show 
signs of having been densely occupied, with this occupation comprising large populations, 
intensive industrial activity, and extensive trade (2001, 85; 2002, 366-367); while Corent is
said to have begun life at the beginning of this period, (c.140/130 BC), as a sanctuary before 
developing into an oppidum, (c.120/100), (Poux and Garcia 2014, 300-301), that was densely 
occupied and specialised in industrial practices and trade with the Mediterranean World (Poux 
2014c). Závist, by comparison, was utilised for similar purposes as the aforementioned sites, 
despite being more modestly populated (Wells 2001, 85). Furthermore, it has also been noted 
475
that although these sites were all enclosed and of a reasonable size7
their internal structures 
were variable with their differences possibly being regional (Wells 2001, 85; 2002, 367). This 
overview of the five comparative oppida therefore depicts these sites as similar in terms of 
their functions even if there were some morphological differences. However, when we look at 
some of the literature bearing reference to these sites, as individual entities, it is evident that 
they were not as similar as first believed. 
The site of Bibracte has recently been interpreted as fulfilling a predominately politicoreligious role (Fernández-Götz 2014a, 380); however, for many years prior to this the site was 
believed to have primarily been a centre for trade and industry (Guillaument 1991; Nash 1976, 
107), where craft activities took place on an almost industrial scale (Dhennequin et al. 2008, 
77 cf. Moore 2013, 506). In addition to this Bibracte is also cited to have been used for 
domestic occupation (Guillaument 1991); therefore, this oppidum may have had as many as 
five principal functions during Period 1.
Corent is believed to have been a site that comprised three primary zones of activity: 1) 
domestic occupation and farming, 2) an area for artisans, and 3) a commercial area (Poux 
2014a, 21). The crafts engaged in within the area for artisans include carpentry (Demierre 
2014a, 52), textile production (Guillaud 2014, 87), metalworking in the form of bronze working 
(Demierre 2014b, 110) and lead production (Demierre 2014c, 111), bone working (Dejean and 
Demierre 2014, 113), leather working (Foucras and Demierre 2014, 114), and the production 
of coinage (Gruel and Poux 2014, 174); while the commercial area, thought to have been a 
market (Demierre et al. 2014a, 90-111), primarily specialised in the importation of wine and 
the amphorae this was transported in (Poux et al. 2014, 117-133). Additionally, the site also 
fulfilled a number of religious and communal roles in the area occupied by the sanctuary 
(Guichon and Poux 2014), including celebrations following periods of warfare, as characterised 
by the deposition of weaponry within the sanctuary (Demierre et al. 2014b, 164-165), feasting 
and sacrifices (Foucras and Poux 2014, 170-171), the offering of libations (Poux 2014d, 172-
173), and the hosting of royal banquets (Pranyies 2014, 196-197).
 
7 Bibracte covered an area of 135ha, Manching 350ha, Stradonice 80ha, Staré Hradisko 38ha, and Závist 170ha 
(Collis 1984a).
476
Of the sites comprising this element of the present study Manching is possibly the best known. 
Despite not being excavated in its entirety, something that no oppidum has ever been, it is the 
site that has been the most extensively investigated (Collis 1984a, 36-37). Archaeological 
examinations at Manching have revealed that one of the site’s most prominent functions was 
as an industrial centre (Cumberpatch 1995; Maier 1991, 331), with its primary role as such 
being to enable the mass production of iron artefacts (Collis 1984b, 150; Krämer 1960, 71; 
Wells 2002, 368), a process which appears to have led to as many as 200 different types of iron 
implement being manufactured at the site (Jacobi 1974 cf. Wells 2002, 368). In addition to 
this, there is evidence for a number of additional crafts at the site, including: bronze-smithing 
(Collis 1984b, 150; Krämer 1960, 73; Wells 2002, 368), textile production (Collis 1984b, 150-
151), the minting of coinage (ibid, 150; Krämer 1960, 73-74), glass working (Krämer 2002,
73; Wells 2002, 368), and the production of ceramics (Wells 2002, 369; Krämer 1960, 71). 
In addition to the above, Manching was also used for domestic occupation (Brun 1995b; 
Gebhard 1995; Maier 1991, 530); farming activities, both arable cultivation (Brun 1995b; 
Gebhard 1995; Körber-Grohne and Piening 1979, Fig. 1; Knörzer 1976 cf. Champion et al. 
1992, 304; Maier 1991, 530) and animal husbandry (Boessneck 1971 cf. Champion et al. 1992, 
304; Krämer 1960, 70); ritual/religious purposes (Wells 2002, 370); and as a trading centre 
(Collis 1984a, 96-98; Cunliffe 2011, 374; Gebhard 1995, 112; Krämer 1960, 74-77). 
The third of the five oppida to which the thesis’ case studies are to be compared shares a 
number of similarities with those considered above; however, there are also some areas where 
it differs. Závist like Manching appears to have been primarily used for industrial purposes 
(Motyková et al. 1991); in particular for blacksmithing (Motyková et al. 1978 cf. Cumberpatch 
1995, 74), and the production of coinage (Jansová 1974; Motyková et al. 1978 cf. Cumberpatch 
1995, 76). These industrial activities, like those at the above sites, were coupled with trade 
(Motykavá et al. 1991), and domestic occupation (Collis 1984a, 197; Motykavá et al. 1991). 
However, unlike both Bibracte and Manching this site does not appear to have been used for 
ritual/religious purposes; although this could be a result of the areas of the site that have been 
excavated to date. A similar pattern of site use is seen at the final two comparative oppida.
Stradonice at this time was used for domestic occupation and agricultural production 
(Cumberpatch 1995, 74), as well as a combination of both trade and industry (Bren 1991; Collis 
1984a; Cumberpatch 1995, 74). Similarly, the site of Staré Hradisko was also designed to 
477
support these activities (Collis 1984a, Fig. 8.10; Cumberpatch 1995, 74; Meduna 1991, 546-
547). Consequently, these sites can be said to have more in common, in terms of the nature of 
their occupation, with Závist than with Bibracte, Corent, or Manching. It is with this, and the 
other observations noted above in mind, that our attention turnsto a consideration of occupation 
at these purported oppida compares to that at Colchester, Titelberg, and Canterbury.
Of the thesis’ case sites Titelberg and Canterbury can be said to have more in common with 
the comparative oppida than Colchester. In the case of Titelberg it can be said that the site 
displayed the same characteristics as Bibracte, Corent, and Manching because it was also used 
for a combination of domestic occupation, farming regimes, industrial practices, trade, 
religious activities, and possible political/administrative tasks (see Chapter 11.2.2.2). 
Furthermore, the site also exhibits some of the same characteristics as Závist, Stradonice, and 
Staré Hradisko, as these sites, while not religious or political/administrative centres, were used 
for the other activities evidenced at Bibracte, Corent, and Manching. Meanwhile, the site of 
Canterbury can be said to have been used to the same end as Závist, Stradonice, and Staré 
Hradisko, and in doing so partially relate to Bibracte, Corent, and Manching because like the 
former sites it was not used for either religious or political pursuits. In the case of Colchester
on-the-other-hand, we can say that in being tentatively linked to domestic occupation and 
farming activities during Period 1 the site shared similarities with all of the oppida noted above; 
while its potential use as a religious/ritual centre can be said to further link it to Bibracte, 
Corent, and Manching. However, unlike Titelberg and Canterbury, Colchester cannot be said 
to completely mirror any of the comparative oppida, because the evidence attributed to this 
site’s Period 1 occupation, (see Chapter 7.3.1.1), cannot be used to definitively state that 
Colchester was occupied at this time, and even if it was this occupation was not as extensive 
as that at the other settlements under consideration here (see Chapters 7.3.1.2, 11.2.2.1).
Consequently, the above comparative study can be said to further highlight the need for us to 
question the relevance of the term oppida today. Although, occupation at Titelberg mirrors 
that at Bibracte, Corent, and Manching, and Canterbury that at Závist, Stradonice, and Staré 
Hradisko, these latter settlements do not display two of the key aspects of the former, thus the 
term oppida can be said to be, being used here to label sites which differed considerably from 
one another. If we continue to refer to these sites as such we run the risk of overlooking key 
aspects of a site’s true nature because it shares one or more characteristics with sites currently 
labelled oppida. 
478
These sites also call into question the relevance of the term oppida in their own right. This 
statement can be made, because in their similarities to both Titelberg and Canterbury, as well 
as to a lesser extent Colchester, these sites demonstrate an incoherence with current definitions 
of oppida. That is to say, current thinking on oppida does not completely reflect the true nature 
of these sites, as it highlights the similarities between them whilst overlooking the ways in 
which the sites do not adhere to the current model of oppida and their functions; even Manching 
which like Titelberg comes close to being the type of site those who defined this term sought
cannot be said to completely adhere to current definitions of this term as it lacks the formalised 
layouts sought in urban centres.
11.2.3.4: A comparison of the thesis’ case sites and contemporaneous non-oppida
This comparative study is designed to consider the extent to which the thesis’ case studies, as 
well as the comparative oppida, can be said to compare to settlements that have never been 
considered oppida in order to further gauge the value of the term oppida today. Arguably, two 
of the best known examples of non-oppida occupied between the years of 150/100 and 55/50
BC in Britain are the Somerset lake villages of Glastonbury and Meare (Minnett and Coles 
1996). 
Over the course of this c.100 year period Glastonbury Lake Village was used8
for a combination 
of domestic occupation, arable, as well as pastoral, farming regimes, and domestic/industrial 
craft production (Cunliffe 2005, 240-242; Jay 2008; Minnett and Coles 1996, 178, 192, 208-
209). This site’s exceptional preservation also indicates that the occupants of Glastonbury 
Lake Village developed a range of craft activities including: bronze-smithing (Cunliffe 2005, 
456; Foster 1991), carpentry (Cunliffe 2005, 242), lead working (ibid, 460), pottery production 
(Bulleid 1948, 20), and weaving (Chittock 316; Cunliffe 2005, 242). Similarly, at the Meare 
Lake Village the site’s occupants engaged in a combination of domestic occupation, farming 
regimes, and domestic/industrial craft production (Cunliffe 2005, 240-242; Minnett and Cole 
1996, 178, 192, 208-209); however, there were some differences in the craft activities 
conducted at Meare. Although, Meare’s craftsmen engaged in bronze-smithing (Cunliffe 2005, 
456), as well as both the production of textiles (Bullied 1948, 62) and pottery (ibid, 18,20), 
they unlike their contemporaries at Glastonbury, were also engaging in the production of glass

479
wares, in particular beads (Cunliffe 2005, 242, 461). Furthermore, it has been pondered that 
Meare Lake Village facilitated trade with the surrounding area (ibid, 174) by hosting annual 
trade fairs (Coles 1987 cf. Cunliffe 2005, 242).
In addition to the above, the author also considered a third British site, Little Woodbury, (which 
is defined as a farmstead), and the Gallic village site of Acy-Romance, Ardennes, as part of the 
current study. Like the two settlements detailed above, Little Woodbury was used for a 
combination of domestic occupation (Bersu 1940; Wainwright and Spratling 1973, 187-188), 
arable and pastoral farming regimes (Bersu 1940; Cunliffe 2005, 376, 381; Hill 2000, 15; 
Wainwright and Spratling 1973, 187-188), and domestic/industrial craft production (Bersu 
1940; Wainwright and Spratling 1973, 187-188). In this case the craft production included: 
carpentry (Cunliffe 2005, 447), leather working (ibid, 215), and weaving (ibid, 215).
Similarly at Acy-Romance the site’s occupants engaged in domestic occupation, a combination 
of both arable and pastoral farming regimes, and domestic/industrial craft production 
(Haselgrove 1996a, 143-144; 2007, Fig, 6; Lambot 1998b; 2002); with the site’s industrial 
processes including blacksmithing, bronze-smithing, and weaving (Lambot 2011). In addition 
to this, Acy-Romance differed from the above sites, by fulfilling a religious role, an inference 
that is based on evidence from the main area of occupation, as well as both the cemeteries and 
mortuary enclosures with which the site is associated (Haselgrove 2007, 497, Fig. 6; Lambot 
1998b; 2002; 2011; Lambot et al. 1994 cf. Haselgrove 2007, 497; Lambot and Méniel 2000, 
104-120 cf. Haselgrove 2007, 497).
The base activities conducted at all four of the non-oppida sites noted above tally with those 
undertaken at Colchester, Titelberg, and Canterbury, as well as the five comparative oppida. 
When we take into account the extent of the occupation conducted at these sites, as well as the 
scale of craft activities their occupants engaged in, it can be said that of the thesis’ three case 
sites only Titelberg really compares; although so too do the five comparative sites. 
Furthermore, Acy-Romance’s ties to later Iron Age religious practices can be said to highlight 
further similarities between it, Titelberg, Manching, Bibracte, and Corent as these sites have
also produced evidence for ritual and religion; therefore, despite, Colchester, and to a lesser 
extent Canterbury, not comparing significantly to the non-oppida, that there are considerable 
similarities between the Lake Villages, Little Woodbury, Acy-Romance and the other so-called 
oppida tells us that a lack of compliance between current definitions of oppida and the nature 
480
of occupation at these sites is only part of the problems we face with the continued use of the 
term. That is to say, these similarities raise another question that we need to address: why are 
some sites considered oppida over others when the nature of their occupation is arguably 
comparable?
However, before we address this question we need to first give consideration to some 
interesting data published in a recent paper by Fernández-Götz (2014a), as this further 
emphasises the conclusions reached above. Within his paper Fernández-Götz notes that it is 
not only oppida where we find evidence of industrial and trading activities on a scale that 
exceeds the norm form non-oppida sites (ibid, 381). In fact, Collis et al. 2000 and Salač 2009 
suggest that considerable economic activity took place at many of the great open 
agglomerations occupied at this time (cf. Fernández-Götz 2014a, 381); including: Aulnat, 
Levroux, and Basel-Gasfabrik in Gaul; Berching-Pollanten in Bavaria, Bad Nauheim in Hess, 
Lovosice in Bohemia, Nĕmčice in Moravia and Sajópetri in Hungary (ibid, 381). Furthermore, 
it is also important to note here that ‘on occasion, the number of finds recovered at these open 
settlements rivals or even exceeds those produced by the oppida, as demonstrated by the 
following data given by Salač (2009); although, it has not yet been excavated, at the open site 
of Nĕmčice some 518 glass bracelets have been found, nearly as many as in the intensely 
excavated oppidum of Manching (620) and many more than in oppida, like Stradonice (143), 
Závist (4); in Roseldorf, some 1500 coins have been found, more than in such important 
fortified sites as Manching (1342), Staré Hradisko (91) or Závist (16)’ (Fernández-Götz 2014a, 
381). It is however not only the number of finds that rival those at the oppida, at the site of 
Berching-Pollanten the range of objects identified during excavations mirrors those found at 
the near-by and contemporaneous oppidum of Manching (Schäfer 2010 cf. Fernández-Götz 
2014a, 381). With these observations, which clearly demonstrate the need to re-evaluate our 
use of the term oppida in that they challenge the typical view that oppida were the most 
important sites within any given area and as such were their region’s economic hub, in mind 
we return to the question: why are some sites considered oppida while others are not.
From the above considerations we know that there are many sites whose occupation was either 
on par with, or exceeded, that which had taken place at the period’s oppida. It therefore leaves 
one pondering what, if anything, has ultimately been used to label the likes of Colchester, 
Titelberg, and Canterbury oppida, but not sites such as the Lake Villages, Nĕmčice, and 
Berching-Pollanten. In order to answer this question we have to return to some of the earliest 
481
classifications of these sites, the notion that oppida are both large in size and fortified (see 
Chapters 2, 11.2.3.2), because many of the other characteristics said to define an oppidum (see 
Chapters 2, 11.2.3.2; Table 2.4) occur so frequently at non-oppida sites, as we have observed 
above, that we cannot justifiably use these to label some sites oppida and others not. 
Conversely, whilst these seem to be the most likely candidates for what ultimately sets these 
sites apart, our earlier consideration of how well the thesis’ case sites comply with current 
definitions of oppida revealed that while all of these sites were large, in terms of the landmass 
they cover, only Titelberg was fortified (see Chapters 11.2.3.1-11.2.3.2). Furthermore, in order 
to accomplish the scale of industrial and economic success they did, the open agglomerated 
settlements in Temperate Europe noted above are likely to have been of a considerable size; 
whilst it is widely known that both the Lake Villages and Little Woodbury were palisaded, 
(Cunliffe 2005, 239-241, 255-269), and therefore arguably fortified, albeit not to the same 
extent as Titelberg and some of the other so-called oppida such as Manching and Závist (Wells 
2002, 367). Consequently, it is evident that even the characteristics considered here are not 
exclusively associated with the so-called oppida; thus suggesting that the opinions of those 
writing on these sites, and the research interests of the time, heavily influenced their 
characterisation as oppida.
11.3: Period 2: 55/50 – 30/25 BC
11.3.1: Period 2 within the context of the later Iron Age
Much like Period 1 this c.30 year period is primarily characterised by agrarian societies who 
obtained that which they could not acquire/produce locally through social and economic 
relationships; relationships that were based on kinship and the generation of surplus 
respectively (see Chapter 11.2.1). Furthermore, Period 2 saw many of the advancements that 
had taken place/started to take place in both Britain and Temperate Europe between 150/100 
and 55/50 BC intensify.
In Britain, the years of 55/50-30/25 BC saw the number of so-called oppida in southern and 
south-eastern regions increase (Cunliffe 1995a, 69-70; Mattingly 2007, 56), an intensification 
of trading links between Britain, Gaul, and the Mediterranean world, which ultimately led to 
the shifting of trading centres from central southern Britain and sites such as Hengistbury Head 
to the south-east and sites in the Thames region (Cunliffe 1984, 5-6; 1995a, 66-67; Collis 
482
1984b, 163; Peacock 1971; 1984, 38; Mattingly 2007, 68), and the strengthening of 
relationships between communities in Essex, Kent, and Hertfordshire in Britain and GalloBelgic societies on the Near Continent, a process that led to these areas developing closely 
related cultural practices, but in particular an elite cremation burial rite (Birchall 1965, 270-
279; Creighton 2006, 19; Cunliffe 1984, 13; Millett 1990, 31). Finally, many of the 
developments witnessed over the course of Period 2 in Britain have been attributed to Caesar’s 
incursions of Britain in 55/54 BC and/or his conquest of Gaul that spanned from 58-51 BC 
(Collis 1984b, 163; Cunliffe 1984, 5-6, 13; 1995a, 66-67; Mattingly 2007, 56; Millett 1990, 
31; Peacock 1971; Wells 2002, 370), because it is believed that these events led to ‘large centres 
of manufacturing, commerce, and political power [emerging] at sites such as Verlamion (St 
Albans) (Haselgrove and Millett 1997) and Camulodunum (Colchester) (Millett 1990)’ (Wells 
2002, 370).
Within Temperate Europe this period saw not only the continued development of its settlement 
pattern, industries, and material culture, in particular ceramic styles (Champion et al. 1992, 
300), but the intensification of economic relationships between Gaul and the Mediterranean 
World (Cunliffe 1984, 5-6). Furthermore, over the course of Period 2 the latter of these 
developments led to an increased number of luxury products circulating in Temperate Europe 
(Champion et al. 1992, 309); luxury products that found their way into the period’s elite burials 
(ibid, 309), such as those at the cemetery of Goeblange-Nospelt situated 15km to the west of 
Titelberg (Thill 1966b; 1967 cf. Champion et al. 1992, 309).
Furthermore, this period also saw the introduction of new architectural styles, that is those that 
had affinity with the Roman World (Champion et al. 1992, 300), and in Gaul an apparently 
‘unprecedented degree of cultural homogeneity’ (ibid, 300). Where present, these changes are 
believed to have been sparked by the political influence of the Roman World as a result 
Caesar’s conquest of Gaul (ibid, 300); however, in areas not privy to these advancements it is 
argued that much remained as it had been prior to Caesar’s conquest and the Roman interest 
this sparked in Temperate Europe (Millett 1990, 31; Drinkwater 1983); in other words, these 
areas remained much as they had been in the c.100 years prior to 55/50 BC. It is against the 
above backdrop that Period 2 occupation at Colchester, Titelberg, and Canterbury took place.

11.3.2: Period 2 occupation at the thesis’ case sites
11.3.2.1: Colchester
Between the years of 55/50 and 30/25 BC Colchester was almost as sparsely occupied as it had 
been during Period 2 (see Chapter 7.3.2; Figures 7.24-7.26; Appendix 7.14); despite a new 
centre of occupation potentially emerging at Gosbecks (see Chapter 7.3.2.1). This new area of 
Colchester, should it have been occupied at all at this time, was used in much the same way as 
The Garrison in that it was likely a farmstead. Other than this new addition to the site, however,
Period 2 Colchester functioned in much the same way as its Period 1 precursor (see Chapter
11.1.2.1). That is to say, Sheepen continued to be used as both a port and religious focus, while 
The Garrison maintained its role as a farmstead whose occupants engaged in arable and pastoral 
farming regimes and most likely some form of craft production (see Chapter 7.3.2.2). Further 
to this, there is evidence to suggest that this period may have also seen the beginnings of a 
ceramic industry at Sheepen, and a wider pool of imported products used by the elite to display 
their social standing (see pages 180-181).
11.2.2.2: Titelberg
In contrast to Colchester, Period 2 occupation at Titelberg can be said to represent a 
considerable intensification of the site’s use since Period 1 (see Chapter 9.3.2; Figures 9.37, 
9.40-9.44). Despite this intensification, Titelberg continued to facilitate the same activities as
it had between the years of 150/100 and 55/50 BC (see Chapter 11.1.2.2); in other words, it 
continued to be used for a combination of domestic occupation, pastoral, and to a lesser degree 
arable, farming, industrial, and religious activities (see Chapter 9.3.2.2). Although, of these 
activities it was the site’s role as an industrial centre that became the most pronounced of all 
over the course of this 30 year period (see Chapter 9.3.2.3).
The latter of the above inferences is based on the evidence associated with the site’s ceramic 
and metalworking industries. An analysis of this evidence suggests that the ceramic industry 
was responsible for producing c.50% more pottery than it had during Period 1 (see page 338); 
while the metalworking industries produced considerably more coins and other metal artefacts, 
such as brooches, than they had during the previous c.100 years (see pages 346-347). 
Accordingly, it is possible to surmise that Titelberg’s primary function at this time was as an 
industrial centre.
484
Further to the above, Period 2 also saw the number of imports at Titelberg increase (see Chapter 
9.3.2.2; see Figures 9.41-9.44). This tells us that the site’s economic relationships with other 
communities within Gaul became more advanced/affluent at this time (see pages 340-346). 
Moreover, this increase in imported wares allowed the author to surmise that there was a greater 
desire amongst the elite to define their social standing, as well as increased interest in the use 
of imports, particularly imported vessels, during events of a communal nature, whether they 
were feasts designed to foster social cohesion or religious festivals carried out within the ‘Holy 
Enclosure’ (see page 340, 346). Finally, it is not just the use of the ‘Holy Enclosure’ that 
denotes the continuation of communal events at this site, so too does the continued use of the 
cemetery of Lamadelaine (see pages 347-350).
11.2.2.3: Canterbury
Canterbury underwent a number of developments and declines between Periods 1 and 2. The 
years 55/50 to 30/25 BC saw those areas of the site that had been most intensively used during 
Period 1 diminish: Bigbury ceased to be occupied (in so far as there is nothing known from the 
site datable to later than 10 BC (see Chapter 10.3.1-10.3.2), life at St Edmund’s School was 
stripped back to its bare minimum, while that at Turing College was negligible (see Chapter 
10.3.2.1-10.3.2.2). Contrastingly, the area now occupied by the modern city was more 
intensively inhabited than during Period 1; the Marlowe Car-park site continued to be used, 
and at least two additional areas of the city emerged as centres of later Iron Age occupation 
(see page 421). Furthermore, this period was associated with a more extensive archaeological 
record (see Figures 10.9-10.12; Appendices 10.11-10.13), therefore telling us that the site’s 
population levels likely increased over the course of this c.30 year period. 
Despite being significantly altered, in terms of its layout within the landscape, Canterbury 
continued to be used for the same purposes that it had during Period 1 (see Chapter 11.1.2.3). 
In other words, the site continued to support a combination of domestic occupation, arable and 
pastoral farming regimes, and craft production (see Chapter 10.3.2.3). With regards to craft 
production, Period 2 saw the site’s craftsmen continue to produce, to varying degrees, textiles, 
ceramics, and metalwork. Conversely, in spite of local craftsmen continuing to produce these 
items Canterbury maintained close economic ties with its hinterland, through which its 
occupants likely obtained many of the products they required on a daily basis; including
ceramics and brooches (see pages 427). Furthermore, Period 2 also witnessed Canterbury’s 
merchants likely establish economic ties with Folkestone, and through them Gaul, as evidenced 
485
by the increasing number of continental products circulating within its environs at this time 
(see page 425-427). The presence of these continental imports demonstrates the continued 
existence of a stratified community at Canterbury, and/or its population’s engagement in 
communal activities (see page 424).
11.3.3: A series of comparisons
11.3.3.1: A comparison of occupation at the thesis’ case sites
On the surface, Period 2 occupation at Colchester, Titelberg, and Canterbury appears to have 
been quite similar, as all three of these sites were used for a combination of domestic 
occupation, farming practices, and craft production; just as they had been during Period 1. 
Furthermore, they also all appear to have continued to house stratified communities who had 
trading relationships with Gaul and/or the Mediterranean world through which they obtained 
luxury products. However, as was the case with their Period 1 occupation, (see Chapter 
11.2.3.1), there are a number of differences that can be said to set the thesis’ case sites apart, 
and in doing so demonstrate that these sites are not as uniform as their characterisation as 
oppida might lead us to believe.
As these differences (which include the scale of occupation at the sites, the types of craft 
production engaged in, the observation of religious festivals and burial customs, as well as the 
level of trade the sites’ merchants were involved in) altered little between Periods 1 and 2 it is 
unnecessary to consider them in detail here. Instead the author feels it is enough to summarise 
these differences thus: of the three sites Titelberg was the most densely occupied during Period 
2, and unlike either Colchester or Canterbury it was associated with the interment of the dead 
at this time. Furthermore, with many of the elevated areas at Canterbury ceasing to be occupied 
to the same extent as they were during Period 1 after c.55/50 BC it can be said that both this 
site and Colchester differed from Titelberg geographically, because unlike the latter site these 
settlements were located in valley bottoms; however this difference does not mean that the sites 
purposes did not overlap.
9
 In addition to this, Titelberg and Colchester continued to differ from 
Canterbury because they had areas of potential religious import at this time; and in retaining 
its position of political power within its environs Titelberg can be said to have further differed 
from both Colchester and Canterbury, as neither of these sites display evidence, such as tribal 
coinage (see Chapters 7.3.2.1, 10.3.2.1), that could be used to suggest they were affiliated with 
 
9 These factors remain true for the remainder of these sites’ later Iron Age occupation.
486
political activities at this time. Consequently, it can be said that while there are some 
similarities in Period 2 occupation at the thesis’ case sites, it is actually their differences that 
characterise their purpose. 
11.3.3.2: How does occupation at the thesis’ case sites compare to current thinking on oppida?
During considerations of Period 1 occupation at Colchester, Titelberg, and Canterbury it was 
noted that although all three sites adhered to certain aspects of the elements considered defining 
characteristics of oppida, it was Titelberg that most fully conformed; but even then this was 
not enough for the author to truly consider this site an oppidum (see Chapter 11.2.3.2). Similar 
inferences were drawn in relation to these sites’ Period 2 occupation; it is therefore unnecessary 
to consider these in detail here.
Instead, the author feels it is enough to state that whilst all three of these sites continued to 
cover considerable tracts of land it was once again only Titelberg that displayed evidence of 
fortifications.10
 Furthermore, in terms of these sites displaying urban qualities it can be said 
that although all three sites meet the first requisite of urbanism, (size), none of them meet the 
second, (a formalised settlement layout, such as those seen in early Roman Towns (see Chapter 
1.2.1)), only Titelberg and Colchester the third, (a religious focus)
11, whilst Titelberg alone 
complies with the fourth, (a political focus).
Additionally, sites labelled oppida are expected to show signs of industrial activities and long 
distance trade something that it could be argued all three case sites do; however, only Titelberg 
can be said to have engaged in industrial activities at this time on the scale one might expect 
of an apparent oppidum. With regards to long distance trade, on-the-other-hand, it can be said 
that whilst both Colchester and Canterbury’s occupants engaged in this activity, only Titelberg 
displays evidence of this activity to the extent we might expect of so-called oppida.
Similarly, the final three characteristics sought in potential oppida were also not visible at all 
of the case sites. With regards to the notion that oppida were centres of administrative/tribal 
 
10 It should be noted that later Iron Age fortifications may have existed at Canterbury but they have not survived 
within the archaeological record due to later natural and cultural formation process, while those of a later date at 
Colchester could, with additional examination, prove to have been earlier in date, however, based on the evidence 
currently associated with them we cannot link them to the site’s later Iron Age occupation (see Chapter 7.1.2.6).
11 No such evidence exists at Canterbury, although it is possible that one may have existed below this site’s Roman 
Temple; particularly when we take into account the fact that many Iron Age shires developed into Roman temples 
(Woolf 1998, 235-236).
487
power, it can be said that as the purported mint for much of the Treveri’s coinage, (see Chapters 
9.2; 9.3.2.2), Titelberg complies to this definition of oppida; whilst there is no evidence to 
suggest that either Colchester or Canterbury did. The second of these additional definitions 
desires oppida to display evidence of religious and/or funerary complexes; although both 
Colchester and Titelberg can be said to meet with the first of these stipulations neither of these
sites display evidence enough to suggest that they were funerary complexes12, even Titelberg 
which was associated with the cemetery of Lamadelaine at this time. Finally, those responsible 
for characterising oppida within much of the current literature view these sites as central places 
within their wider geographic setting. As was the case with similar considerations of the thesis’ 
case sites it is only Colchester that has ever been labelled a central place (see Table 2.4); 
however, when we refer to Chapter 8, where the author considers occupation at a number of 
sites within Colchester’s hinterland, it is evident that once again Colchester cannot be 
considered a central site because each of the hinterland settlements considered therein show 
signs of being relatively self-sustaining and having acquired their imports either directly from 
Gaul or via other sites within the Essex landscape (see pages 236-237, 247-349, 264-265).
Based on the inferences drawn above, it can be said that it is Titelberg that once again most 
closely complies with current thinking on oppida. Despite this, the author does not feel that 
this site complies enough to warrant its label thus. Furthermore, the author believes that this 
study further highlights the differences between the thesis’ case sites, and in doing so 
demonstrates how labelling them oppida can overshadow their true nature and thus lead to their 
functions being over generalised. 
11.3.3.3: A comparison of the thesis’ case sites and Period 2’s best known oppida
The process of comparing Period 2 occupation at Colchester, Titelberg, and Canterbury with 
that which occurred at the period’s most prominent/best explored oppida was made easier in 
that many of the sites that fall into this category are primarily the same as those considered in 
conjunction with Period 1 occupation at the case sites. Consequently, we have already 
established the functions of these sites, as well as the extent to which they compare to both the 
case sites and current thinking on oppida (see Chapter 11.2.3.3). With this in mind, the author 
only needed to consider whether developments witnessed at Colchester, Titelberg, and 
 
12 For a site to be a funerary complex one would expect this to be its primary purpose, and as such we might expect 
them to display evidence of ritual areas in which communal gatherings associated with death and burial could be 
performed as well as multiple burials, and possibly even multiple cemeteries.
488
Canterbury between Periods 1 and 2 affected the extent to which these sites did/did not compare 
to: Bibracte, Závist, Stradonice, and Staré Hradisko. 
Based on the above observations, (Chapter 11.3.2) it can be said that Period 2 occupation at 
Colchester, Titelberg, and Canterbury remained unaltered in terms of their essential make-up, 
and that it was only an intensification of earlier activities that can be said to set the two periods 
of occupation apart. With this in mind, it can be said that occupation at Titelberg continued to 
bear similarities to that at all of comparative sites, as did Colchester, only to a lesser degree 
given its negligible occupation at this time; whilst the use of Canterbury continued to most 
closely resemble that of Závist, Stradonice, and Staré Hradisko, because unlike Bibracte no 
evidence has been discovered to suggest that it contained a religious centre. Consequently, the 
author feels justified in stating that those conclusions reached in conjunction with a comparison 
of the thesis’ case sites and the aforementioned oppida stand up here (see Chapter 11.2.3.3).
Conversely, in addition to the above comparative sites Period 2 also saw a number of oppida
emerge within the Gallic landscape (Collis 1984a, 74). In light of this development, it was 
necessary to consider whether occupation at these sites can too be said to compare, on some 
level, with that at the thesis’ case sites. Of these sites it is arguably Villeneuve-Saint-Germain 
that has been the most explored, thus making it the ideal site to compare to Colchester, 
Titelberg, and Canterbury, however, consideration will also be given to another Gallic 
oppidum: Pommiers. 
Occupation at Villeneuve-Saint-Germain was characterised by domestic occupation coupled 
with both arable and pastoral farming regimes, and craft production (Auxiette 1996; Debord 
1990; Fulford 1985; Haselgrove 1996a, 147-149; 2007, 507-511); with the latter of these 
pursuits comprising the production of coinage, bronze, iron, glass, pottery, and leather artefacts 
(Debord 1995; Guichard et al. 1993; Haselgrove 1996a, 147-149; 2007, 507-511; Tillard 
1986). Furthermore, it has been surmised that the site’s occupants also engaged in long 
distance trade (Haselgrove 1996a, 147-149), whilst its ditches are said to have formed symbolic 
boundaries (Peyre 2000 cf. Haselgrove 2007, 509) that may have denoted a public space used 
for political and religious meetings just as it is purported was the case at Titelberg (Metzler et 
al. 2006 cf. Haselgrove 2007, 509). 
489
Meanwhile, at the fortified site of Pommiers, situated in the Aisne Valley, it can be said that 
occupation was characterised by its industrial activities (Collins 1998, 159); which involved
metal working, but particularly the large scale production of coinage (Brun and Debord 1991; 
Debord and Nomine 1983; Foucart 1973; 1979; Vauvillé 1904 cf. Collins 1998, 159) and 
brooches (Vauvillé 1912 cf. Collins 1998, 159).
Villeneuve-Saint-Germain’s principal functions can. Therefore, be seen to tally with those at 
the thesis’ case sites; that is to say that like this Gallic site Colchester, Titelberg, and Canterbury 
were utilised for some degree of domestic occupation, farming activities, craft production, and 
long distance trade. Furthermore, like the case sites’ occupants, Villeneuve-Saint-Germain’s 
population engaged in long distance trade; whilst the site’s potential use as both a religious and 
political foci can be said to link this site to Titelberg, and to a lesser extent Colchester which 
had a religious focus but not a political one at this time. In the case of Pommiers, on-the-otherhand, it can be said that occupation at this site differs considerably from that at the case sites, 
and adheres little with current definitions of oppida, particularly as its primary, and best 
understood function, was to act as an industrial centre specialising in metalwork. Therefore it 
can be said that some similarities exist between Titelberg and Pommiers in that the former of 
these sites was also utilised for the production of coinage at this time (see Chapters 9.3.2.2, 
11.3.2.2), however little can be said to link it to either Colchester or Canterbury at this time. 
Consequently, it can once more be observed that of the thesis’ case sites it is Titelberg that 
most closely resembles the comparative sites, and as such demonstrates how few sites can be 
said to wholly comply with the defining characteristics of oppida.
11.3.3.4: A comparison of the thesis’ case sites and contemporaneous non-oppida
Two of the better known non-oppida sites occupied during Period 2 are the Glastonbury and 
Meare Lake Villages. As these sites were also occupied during Period 1 (see Chapter 11.2.3.4), 
and occupation at Colchester, Titelberg, and Canterbury remained largely unchanged between 
Periods 1 and 2, it can be said that occupation at the thesis’ case sites continued to compare to 
that at these comparative sites (see Chapter 11.2.3.4). Consequently, it seems likely that this 
comparative study, like that which have come before it, will bear the same conclusions as those 
conducted in relation to Period 1 occupation at the thesis’ case sites. However, the Lake 
Villages are not the only non-oppida settlements of Period 2 date for which we have
understanding enough to make them suitable comparative sites for the current project.
490
In addition to the Lake Villages, the author compared Period 2 occupation at Colchester, 
Titelberg, and Canterbury to that at the well-known site of Gussage-All-Saints in Dorset. 
Gussage-All-Saints is regularly viewed as a self-supporting farmstead (Foster 1991) that was 
utilised for a combination of domestic occupation (ibid; Wainwright 1973, 194; 1979), arable 
cultivation (Foster 1991; Wainwright 1973, 196; 1979, 188), animal husbandry (Cunliffe 2005, 
376; Foster 1991; Harcourt 1979; Wainwright 1973, 192, 295), and domestic/industrial craft 
production including: blacksmithing (Foster 1991; Spratling 1973, 199; Wainwright 1973, 
196), bone working (Spratling 1973, 201), bronze working (Cunliffe 1995b; 2005, 227, 456; 
Foster 1980; 1991; Spratling 1973, 198-212; 1979; Wainwright 1973, 194, 196; Wells 2001, 
94; 2002, 370), pottery production (Foster 1991), and weaving (ibid; Wainwright 1973, 196). 
Further to this, the site of Gussage-All-Saints is believed to have been used for long-distance 
trade (Wainwright 1973, 192, 195), and in being so catered for the needs of an elite population; 
particularly those who reared horses (Foster 1991; Mattingly 2007, 58; Wells 2001, 94). 
The above observations once more highlight the similarities between the thesis’ case sites and 
those settlements that have never been termed oppida. Consequently, those inferences borne 
from similar considerations of Period 1 occupation at Colchester, Titelberg, Canterbury and 
contemporaneous non-oppida can be said to stand up here (see Chapter 11.2.3.4). That is to 
say, the above observations leave us questioning why the thesis’ case sites have been labelled 
oppida, whilst Gussage-All-Saints has not. In order to explore this question we have to once 
again consider the earliest definitions of oppida: that they were large, fortified, settlements (see 
Chapter 2.2). 
Considerations of Gussage-All-Saints have revealed that this settlement was both relatively 
large and palisaded; thus meaning it could be viewed as fortified. It can therefore be said that,
like Titelberg, this site complies with both of these defining characteristics of oppida, albeit 
not on the same scale as the so-called oppidum of Titelberg. Consequently, this comparative 
study, like that conducted in conjunction with Period 1 occupation at the thesis’ case sites, can 
be said to reveal that it was the opinions of those writing of these settlements’ later Iron Age 
occupation that led to some sites being labelled oppida, and others not. 
491
11.4: Period 3: 30/25 BC – AD 20/25
11.4.1: Period 3 within the context of the later Iron Age
During this c.55 year period life in much of Britain and Temperate Europe, (with the exception 
of some areas of southern Gaul that fell under Roman control upon the ascension of Augustus, 
(see page 491 below)), continued along the same trajectory as it had in Period 2; that is to say,
life in these regions continued to be characterised by a combination of domestic occupation, 
arable and pastoral farming regimes, and craft production. However, Period 3 was also a time 
of considerable change; whereby, the social, economic, and power connotations of these areas 
were altered by the many developments with which this period can be associated. 
In Britain these developments can be attributed to one, or both, of the following processes: 1) 
the forging of diplomatic treaties between British tribes and Augustus (Haselgrove 1987, 201; 
Mattingly 2007, 72; Millett 1990, 33), which are believed to have led to allied nobles sending 
their sons to Rome to be educated (Creighton 2000, 137; Roymans 2009, 229-230); and 2) the 
“Romanisation” of Gaul (Creighton 2006, 19-20; Cunliffe 1995a, 116). Arguably some of the 
starkest advancements borne from these processes are visible within the region’s economy; and 
included the strengthening of the Belgica-Thames trade link (Creighton 2006, 19; Mattingly 
2007, 72), first established during Period 2 (see Chapter 11.3.1), which resulted in increased 
trade with Temperate Europe, and saw products arrive in the south-east of Britain from Gaul, 
Iberia, the Rhineland, and the Roman World (Cunliffe 1984, 15). Furthermore, if we are to 
believe the writings of Strabo, increased trade with Temperate Europe led to the appearance of 
ivory, chains, necklaces, amber gems, glass vessels, wine, and Roman ceramics in Britain 
(Cunliffe 1984, 13; Fulford 1985, 93; Strabo Geography 4.5.3); items for which they 
exchanged: grain, cattle, gold, silver, iron, hides, slaves, and dogs (Cunliffe 1984, 13; 1995a, 
61; Fulford 1985, 93; Strabo Geography 4.5.2). In addition to this, the economic advancements 
of Period 3 also comprised the mass importation of Gallo-Belgic wares, after they started to be 
manufactured in 15/10 BC (see Chapter 4.2), and an increased use of coinage (Champion et al.
1992, 308; Haselgrove 1987, 201, Fig. 5.5; Millett 1990, 83).
Further to the above, this period also saw the social structures of the south-east develop into 
systems comprising local dynasties whose leaders are said to have had full political and military 
control of their local regions (Champion et al. 1992, 316; Cunliffe 1978a, 64-114). Moreover, 
it is curious to note that the literature often refers to this period as the time at which the oppida
appear in both southern and eastern Britain (Champion et al. 1992, 311; Creighton 2006, 19; 
492
Cunliffe 1978a, 243-286; 1995a, 69-79; Millett 1990, 33; Pitts 2010, 35), despite a number of 
sites occupied before this time being referred to as oppida within the literature, such as 
Hengistbury Head (Fitzpatrick 2007, 159, Fig. 2.13 cf. Jarrett 2010, 33; McOmish 2011, 2).
Meanwhile, in continental Temperate Europe some areas changed very little at this time, whilst 
others, such as Gaul, underwent a number of considerable, and at times drastic, developments. 
Arguably the most significant change within Temperate Europe at this time was the absorption 
of Gaul into the Roman Empire (Brogan 1953, 26; Drinkwater 1983, 20-21; Haselgrove 1987, 
196; 1996a, 138; King 1990, 64; Millett 1990, 32; Woolf 1998, 32). Initially, this led to a 
precarious relationship between the indigenous populations and the Roman World whereby 
little was significantly altered; but over time, Augustus introduced towns, namely civitates
(such as Autun and Nîmes (Woolf 1998, 113)), to southern Gaul that eventually spread further 
north (King 1990, c.3; Vanderhoeven 1996, 190; Woolf 1998, 118-119), as well as the taxation 
system that was in place elsewhere within the Empire (Vanderhoeven 1996, 190; Woolf 1998, 
44-45). Conversely, the introduction of this tax based administration was not the only political 
development to have occurred in Gaul during Period 3. The newly emerged towns took on the 
same administrative roles as they had elsewhere in the Empire (King 1990, 64-66; 
Vanderhoeven 1996, 190; Woolf 1998, 32), however, a new system was also put in place 
whereby the indigenous elite could only obtain power if they served in the Roman army and 
showed signs of “Romanisation” (King 1990, 65); moreover, upon becoming members of this 
new aristocracy, the elite could expand their power and status by mediating between the 
Romans and Gallic population (Woolf 1998, 33).
Temperate Europe also underwent a number of economic advancements at this time. This 
period saw greater emphasis put upon the productivity of industries (ibid, 46); in fact, a number 
of new settlements emerged in the rural areas of both Gaul and the Rhineland for this very 
purpose (King 1990, 89-90). One of the most visible industries of this period was centred on 
the production of pottery (King 1990, 64; Woolf 1998, 190-191), particularly the Gallo-Belgic 
wares which started to emerge after c.20 BC (see Chapter 4.2). Furthermore, Period 3 also 
witnessed an increase in trade and exchange between communities within Temperate Europe 
itself, as well as between these communities and the Roman World (Woolf 1998, 181-185); a 
process which gave rise to a new trade axis spanning from Lyon to the Rhineland, and thus the 
new Roman frontier (King 1990, 115) and a material culture that was often very different from 
493
that which had come before it (Woolf 1998, 181-185). It was within this framework of 
developments that Period 3 occupation at Colchester, Titelberg, and Canterbury took place.
11.4.2: Period 3 occupation at the thesis’ case sites
11.4.2.1: Colchester
Period 3 marks the emergence of intense occupation at Colchester; with Sheepen, Gosbecks, 
and The Garrison all being used extensively at this time (see Figures 7.27-7.30; Appendices 
7.15-7.17). Furthermore, this is the period within which the Lexden Tumulus, one of the two 
burial complexes with which later Iron Age Colchester is associated, was established (see 
Chapter 7.3.3.1; Figure 7.35; Appendix 7.17).
Over the course of this c.55 year period both Gosbecks and The Garrison were used for a 
combination of domestic occupation, arable and pastoral farming regimes, and craft production 
(see Chapter 7.3.3.2). With regards to the latter of these pursuits we cannot at present ascertain 
the exact crafts The Garrison’s occupants engaged in, craftsmen at Gosbecks produced 
metalwork, textiles, and woodwork (see page 196). Additionally, the author surmised that 
Gosbecks may have also been a centre of religious import at this time; an inference that is based 
on the existence of a sanctuary within its environs (see page 188).
Period 3 use of Sheepen, meanwhile, was characterised by its role as both a port and religious 
centre (see Chapter 7.3.3.1). In other words, this is the period within which those activities 
purported to have taken place here during Periods 1 and 2 can truly be said to have taken hold 
at the site. Furthermore, this period witnessed the possible emergence of a ceramic industry at 
Sheepen, in addition to one that may have specialised in metalwork (see pages 190-192, 197). 
This region of Colchester may also have been inhabited domestically, (see page 188); although,
it is difficult to ascertain the truth in this notion using the evidence available.
In addition to the above, Period 3 occupation at Colchester was also characterised by 
developments in the site’s social, economic, and power connotations. The economic 
developments of Britain and Temperate Europe, outlined in Chapter 11.4.1 above, led to the 
appearance of a sizable Gallo-Belgic ceramic assemblage at Period 3 Colchester (see Chapter 
7.3.3.1; Appendix 7.16). The adoption of these ceramics can be said to have been directly 
494
responsible for the changes witnessed in the site’s social and power connotations
13; which 
included: the probable adoption of Roman dining habits, the ways in which the site’s elite 
displayed their social standing, and/or those products reserved for use during communal events 
be they designed to celebrate religious festivals or promote social cohesion (see pages 189-
190). 
Furthermore, these developments were also identified through an analysis of the Lexden 
Tumulus. However, in addition to further demonstrating the development of Colchester’s 
economic relationships (see page 201), as well as the ways in which the elite displayed their 
status, and imported wares were utilised during communal events, this burial can be said to 
highlight the emergence of a new burial rite, (see page 200), and in doing so a change in the 
site’s social connotations. In other words, the Lexden Tumulus can be said to illustrate the 
ways in which Colchester’s resident population dealt with death, and the cultural practices 
associated with this.
Consequently, the above inference led the author to conclude that Period 3 occupation at 
Colchester was characterised by a stratified community who specialised in long distance trade 
and industry, whilst also engaging in traditional Iron Age pursuits.
11.4.2.2: Titelberg
Period 3 occupation at Titelberg left a considerable footprint within the archaeological record
(see Figures 9.47-9.50; Appendices 9.21-9.23), and although life at the site underwent a 
number of changes these were slight in comparison to those taking place simultaneously at 
Colchester. This c.55 year period saw Titelberg continue to exist as a centre of industrial 
production that also retained its position of religious import (see Chapter 9.3.3.3); furthermore, 
Period 3 saw Titelberg continue to be used for the purposes of domestic occupation, arable 
cultivation, animal husbandry, and long distance trade (see Chapter 9.3.3.3). Additionally, 
Titelberg’s craftsmen continued to produce ceramics, metalwork, and those goods that can be 
manufactured from the secondary products obtained through animal husbandry such as textiles 
(see Chapter 9.3.3.2; Appendix 9.23); however, whilst there was a definite upsurge in the 
 
13 Although, it should also be noted that these wares would have also supported the continuation of practices 
already in place at this time (Okun 1989, 50); in other words, Colchester’s occupants would have also utilised 
these products in native dining situations.
495
number of ceramics being produced at Titelberg at this time (see Figure 9.55), there was also 
a decline in its output of certain metal products, particularly coinage (see page 369).
The decline in coinage suggests that in addition to a decline in the metal products Titelberg’s 
craftsmen were manufacturing, a slump in Titelberg’s regional importance occurred. That is 
to say, the limited output of Treveri coins at Titelberg during Period 3 likely reflects a 
diminishment in the site’s status as a regional centre for this tribe, and the political importance 
it had likely enjoyed as a result of this (see page 369). This is, however, not the only 
development/change witnessed at Titelberg at this time.
Period 3 saw Roman table wares become common place at Titelberg (see Figure 9.55; 
Appendix 9.22), suggesting that these items were no longer reserved for the elite and/or events 
of special significance as they had been during Periods 1 and 2 (see Chapter 11.2.2.2, 11.3.2.2), 
but were used on a daily basis by everyone in residence (see pages 360, 365). Furthermore, 
the author associated this period with the emergence of settlement morphology more 
commonly associated with Roman Towns (see Appendix 9.21). These developments can,
therefore, be said to represent the likely influence Gaul’s absorption into the Roman Empire 
had had on the site, its occupants, and its material culture (see Chapter 9.3.3.3). 
It is not only the evidence recovered from Titelberg’s plateau that can be said to highlight the 
increasing influence Rome was having upon the occupants of this site, so too did that recovered 
at Lamadelaine (see Figures 9.51-9.52; Appendices 9.24-9.25). Despite the evidence of Period 
3 date at this cemetery clearly demonstrating the continued observation of those burial rites 
first used at the site during Period 1, (see page 370), the discovery of figurines and gaming 
paraphernalia within one of the graves interred at this time (see Figure 9.52; Appendix 9.25),
can be said to further denote the adoption of material culture more commonly associated with
the Roman World (see pages 373). Furthermore, it became clear from an analysis of this 
evidence in conjunction with contemporaneous burials at the cemetery of Goeblange-Nospelt 
that these new items were associated with the elite (see pages 373-374).14
 It can therefore be 
 
14 Titelberg’s association with burials on this scale is relatively unique, very few sites of Titelberg’s size display 
such evidence at this time in Temperate Europe; it is therefore possible that the use of Roman material culture 
within grave deposits was a local preference, however, it is possible that it is also the result of northern Gaul’s 
cultural ties with south-east Britain, (see page 78), as this practice can also be observed within the Lexden Tumulus 
at Colchester (see Chapter 7.3.3.2). 
496
said that, in addition to daily life at Titelberg being altered by Augustus’ annexation of Gaul, 
so too were the ways in which the site’s elite displayed their status. 
It can be concluded then, that despite the site continuing to adhere to traditional Iron Age 
pursuits its resident population, which was clearly stratified, adopted a number of Roman 
cultural practices; whilst the site as a whole lost some of its regional importance. This 
chronological timeframe was therefore a period of considerable change at Titelberg.
11.4.2.3: Canterbury
Period 3 at Canterbury, much like at Colchester, was marked by an intensification of 
occupation (see Figures 10.17-10.21; Appendices 10.14-10.16). This period saw not only the 
continued decline of the St Edmund’s School and Turing College sites, but the expansion of 
later Iron Age occupation within the area now occupied by the modern city (see pages 431, 
437). In addition to the Marlowe Car-park, this region of Canterbury was occupied by a further 
18 sites (see page 429; Figure 10.17; Appendix 10.14).
All 23 of the aforementioned sites were utilised for a combination of domestic occupation, 
farming regimes, and craft production, (see pages 431, 437), just as those occupied during 
Periods 1 and 2 were (see Chapters 11.2.2.3 and 11.3.2.3). The continued use of the Canterbury 
region for craft production was, at this time, coupled with the emergence of bloomeries for the 
smelting of iron within the landscape (see page 431). In addition to ironwork, craft production 
at Canterbury included: small scale bronze-smithing, as evidenced by the discovery of crucibles 
and pellet moulds at the Marlowe Car-park site (see Appendix 10.16); the production of 
textiles, as indicated by the discovery of loomweights at both the Marlowe Car-park and Turing 
College sites, (see Appendix 10.16); and possibly even some degree of pottery production, as 
hinted at by the discovery of local flint tempered sherds at the St Edmunds School and Turing 
College sites, (see Appendix 10.15), which may have been produced at the kiln discovered at 
the latter of these sites (see Chapters 10.3.1-10.3.2). Despite the growth of the aforementioned 
industries, however, Canterbury continued to import the majority of those items its occupants 
would have required the use of on a daily basis; that is ceramics and brooches (see pages 441, 
444-445). 
In light of the above observations, and the fact that the region was more densely occupied at 
this time, (suggesting an increase in population numbers), it can be said that Canterbury’s 
497
economic relationships with both its hinterland and the merchants of Folkestone from whom 
they obtained continental wares were strengthened (see pages 441-442). These economic 
relationships not only give rise to those ceramic and brooch forms utilised by Canterbury’s 
population on a daily basis (see Figures 10.18-10.19), but led to the importation of Gallo-Belgic 
wares (see Figure 10.26; Appendix 10.15); thus suggesting, that this site, like Colchester, was 
affected by the annexation of Gaul and the changes to material culture this process sparked (see 
page 438). Furthermore, this development not only altered Canterbury’s economy, but the 
regions social and power connotations.
The importation of Gallo-Belgic wares can be said to have provided Canterbury’s population 
with a chance to obtain Roman tablewares for the first time (see Figure 10.24), which, in turn,
is likely to have led to the adoption of Roman dining habits by some/at certain times (see page 
441). In fact, the author surmised that these products were utilised by the elite as a means 
through which to display their social standing and/or at communal events designed to both 
celebrate religious festivals and promote social cohesion (see page 441). It can therefore be 
said, that this period of the later Iron Age was one of change at Canterbury.
Conversely, it is not only in the aforementioned respects that life at Canterbury altered between 
the years of 30/25 BC and AD 20/25. Period 3 also witnessed the emergence of the only later 
Iron Age burials to have been identified, to date, within Canterbury’s landscape (see Figure 
10.17; Appendix 10.14). Interestingly, despite the close cultural ties between the south-east of 
Britain and the near Continent at this time, (see page 78), these burials appear to have been 
established following a different set of burial rites to those observed at both Colchester and 
Titelberg (see Chapter 7.3.3.2, 9.3.3.2) thus suggesting that death was not viewed in the same 
way at Canterbury. Regardless of this difference however, it can be said that Period 3 marks 
the first use of this region for religious/ritual practices.
11.4.3: A series of comparisons
11.4.3.1: A comparison of occupation at the thesis’ case sites
Unlike Periods 1 and 2 when there were few similarities visible in the occupation at the thesis’
case sites, Period 3 occupation at Colchester, Titelberg, and Canterbury had much in common; 
however, this is not to say that there were no differences. Arguably, the clearest evidence for 
increased similarities between the case sites is the proliferation of occupation at both Colchester
and Canterbury at this time; a process that led to all three sites being, for the first time, intensely 
498
occupied (see Chapter 11.4.2). Furthermore, there is clear evidence at each of these sites for 
domestic occupation, farming regimes, and craft production; something with which Titelberg 
had been unerringly associated since Period 1.
15
 Conversely, despite there being evidence of 
weaving, metalwork, and the production of ceramics at each of these sites, it is within their 
industrial activities that the first differences were identified. 
Period 3 occupation at Titelberg was characterised by its industrial activities, which led the 
author to surmise that these pursuits were the site’s main reason for existence. At Colchester
and Canterbury however, craft production was less prominent and likely engaged in to sustain 
the sites’ populations and supplement local economies; this is particularly true of Canterbury 
where the existence of a ceramic industry at this time is questionable,16 and as such the site’s 
occupants appear to have been reliant upon local trading network for these wares. 
This latter point can be said to directly link to the second difference identified between the case 
sites. Although these sites all engaged in long distance trade at this time, the importation of 
products influenced by the Roman World had differing effects on their occupants. At both 
Colchester and Canterbury these wares were used by the elite to display social standing and/or 
at communal events designed to promote social cohesion; at Titelberg meanwhile, products in
Roman styles had become common place and as such were likely utilised by the population as 
a whole on a daily basis. It can therefore be said that Roman influence, borne out of Augustus’ 
annexation of Gaul, led to the adoption of Mediterranean cultural practices at Titelberg, while 
the occupants of Colchester and Canterbury made use of this material in the way that best suited 
them.
It is however, not only with regards to the consumption of imports that the case sites can be 
said to differ. The means through which trade, both local and long distance (see Chapters 
7.3.3.2, 9.3.3.2, 10.3.3.2), was conducted at Colchester, Titelberg, and Canterbury, as well as 
the reasons this process was engaged in, can also be said to set them apart. With Sheepen 
acting as a port, (see Chapter 11.4.2.1), it can be said that one of Colchester’s principal 
functions was to facilitate the movement of tradable wares, be they of local or continental 
 
15 Although a case could be made for Canterbury having also been occupied and utilised for these purposes since 
Period 1 (see Chapter 10).
16 Until such a time that the evidence at Turing College has been fully studied, sequenced, and published we 
cannot be sure that the kiln at this site was in use at this time, therefore we have to be cautious at present when 
stating that the occupants on Canterbury may have been producing their own ceramics.
499
origin. It is therefore possible that a number of the imports at this site were caches of wares 
readied for exchange (see page 189). At Titelberg, on-the-other-hand, trade was likely 
conducted between local Gallic merchants, with many of the imports entering the site in return 
for local products, (such as the ironwork known to have been at the heart of the site’s economy 
(see Chapters 9.2, 9.3.3.2)), at the behest of the elite (see page 365); whilst the majority of 
tradable wares at Canterbury entered the site via Folkestone, with whom the merchants at 
Canterbury likely had well-established trading relationships that allowed products to move 
from the coast inland using both water and overland transport, but unlike the majority of those 
entering either Colchester or Titelberg, these goods were required by the site’s occupants to 
supplement the local economy and ensure the site’s survival (see pages 441-442).
In addition to the above, it can be said that the thesis’ case sites also differ in their religious 
pursuits. Both Colchester and Titelberg continue to display areas used for the communal 
celebration of religious events; although, Colchester expanded in this respect during Period 3. 
That is to say, between 30/25 BC and AD 20/25 an additional religious centre emerged at 
Gosbecks, and co-existed with that at Sheepen for the remainder of the later Iron Age. 
Canterbury meanwhile appears to have remained devoid of a religious centre;
17 once again 
setting this site apart from both Colchester and Titelberg. 
Period 3 also marks the emergence of the earliest later Iron Age burials at both Colchester and 
Canterbury, whilst the cemetery of Lamadelaine continued to be utilised at Titelberg. Although 
the appearance of burials at both Colchester and Canterbury could be said to put all three sites 
on an even keel, with regards to this aspect of later Iron Age religion, an analysis of these 
burials served to further highlight their differences. The aforementioned analysis allowed the
author to surmise that the burial rites observed at Lamadelaine since Period 1 were mirrored 
by the mourners at Colchester who established the Lexden Tumulus during Period 3, whilst 
those who established the cremation burials at Turing College, Canterbury followed a different 
set of burial rites that can be said to further distance this site from the others.18
 It can therefore 
be concluded that despite similarities existing between the case sites, it was their differences 
that characterised them. 
 
17 It is possible future work at Canterbury could reveal a centre of religious import within the site’s environs.
18 It should, however, be remembered that burials of later Iron Age date are relatively rare archaeological 
discoveries, (see Chapter 3.2), and it is therefore possible that similar burial customs to those observed in 
association with the Lexden Tumulus and Lamadelaine cemetery did take place at Canterbury but they have yet 
to be discovered, or the remains of this were deposited in such a way that no traces of them exist today.

11.4.3.2: How does occupation at the thesis’ case sites compare to current thinking on oppida?
In light of the above observations, it is evident that the thesis’ case sites do not comply with 
the image this term conjures of a uniform class of settlement. We therefore need to consider 
the extent to which these sites do adhere to current thinking on what makes a site an oppidum. 
Similar considerations conducted in relation to occupation at Colchester, Titelberg, and 
Canterbury during Periods 1 and 2 revealed that only Titelberg came close to complying wholly 
with these definitions. Given the minimal/questionable use of Colchester during Periods 1 and 
2, and the changing nature of occupation at Canterbury during these earlier periods, this 
inference was somewhat unsurprising; it will therefore be interesting to see whether increased 
occupation at Colchester and Canterbury during Period 3 alters this conclusion.
As was the case with earlier phases of occupation at the thesis’ case sites it can be said that all 
three comply with the first defining characteristic sought in potential oppida: a sizable area of 
occupation; whilst only Titelberg can be said to fully adhere to the second: the presence of 
fortifications. Furthermore, there is potential evidence at The Garrison to suggest that 
fortifications were starting to emerge at Colchester at this time (see Chapter 7.3.3.2); however, 
this evidence has yet to be fully explored and as such it would not be judicious to state here 
that Colchester was fortified during Period 3.
19
Furthermore, current thinking on oppida tells us that these sites have to display urban 
characteristics (see Chapter 2). All three case sites comply with the first aspect of this 
definition: size; yet, only one or two can be said to adhere to the others: the existence of 
religious and political foci in close proximity to domestic occupation, and a formalised site 
plan (see Chapter 11.2.3.2). From the comparative study considered in Chapter 11.4.3.1, we
know that only Colchester and Titelberg can be said to have had religious foci during Period 
3. With regards to the case sites having political foci on-the-other-hand, it can be said that 
despite Titelberg complying with this characteristic during Periods 1 and 2, none of the sites 
meet with this expectation during Period 3; an inference that is based on the absence of 
evidence at both Colchester and Canterbury to suggest political/administrative activities were 
engaged in at these sites, (such as the minting of coinage, but in particular coinage that denotes 
 
19 It is also prudent to note here that the dykes surrounding Colchester’s ancient occupation, (see Chapter 7.1.2.6), 
have not been afforded detailed consideration since their discovery; therefore, their dating can be considered 
patchy at best, and cannot be satisfactorily linked to the site’s later Iron Age occupation even though it is possible 
some of them were in existence at this time (see Chapter 7.1.2.6). In light of this, the author does not feel we can 
use them to definitively state that the site was fortified at this time.
501
a tribal leader or a tribe as a whole (see Chapter 2.3.5)), and the decline in Titelberg’s minting 
activities. Finally, of the three case sites it can be said that only Titelberg show signs of having 
had a formalised settlement layout during Period 3. Consequently, we can conclude that 
despite losing its political foci during Period 3 it is Titelberg that once again most closely 
adheres to the definition of oppida as urban centres.
Furthermore, from Chapter 2 we know that in addition to being large, fortified, urban centres,
current thinking defines oppida as centres of industry and long distance trade. Colchester, 
Titelberg, and Canterbury have all produced evidence to suggest that their occupants engaged 
in these activities (see Chapter 11.4.3.1). However, only Titelberg can be said to have engaged 
in industrial activities on the scale we would expect of a settlement characterised by this 
process; in other words, Titelberg is the only one of the three sites to have produced wares in 
quantities that exceeded local needs. Similarly, despite both Titelberg and Canterbury 
engaging in long distance trade, only Colchester in its role as a port, can be said to have 
complied with the notion that oppida were centres characterised by their engagement in long 
distance trade.
Finally, current thinking tells us that potential oppida must also have been centres of 
power/administrative and tribal/elite power, religious/funerary complexes, and central places 
(see Table 2.4). With regards to the former of these defining characteristics, it can be said that 
none of the case sites have produced evidence of Period 3 date to suggest that they complied 
with the notion that as oppida they were political centres associated with tribal/elite power. In 
fact, the closest they come to meeting this prerequisite is their inhabitation by stratified 
communities. Similarly, whilst both Colchester and Titelberg supported religious activities, 
neither of these sites, nor Canterbury, can be said to have acted as funerary complexes at this 
time. Had they done so we would expect to find extensive cemeteries within the main confines 
of these settlements not one off graves and burials interred within separate enclosures. What 
then of the last characteristic sought in potential oppida?
It is once more the case that of the three case sites only Colchester has been referred to as a 
central place. Furthermore, when comparing Period 3 occupation at Colchester to that taking 
place within this site’s hinterland, (see Chapter 8), it was again evident that this site was not 
responsible for its neighbours’ success. That is to say, despite the intensification witnessed at 
Colchester at this time, Ardleigh, Kelvedon, and Elms Farm continued to exist independently 
502
of this apparently central node. These settlements, like Colchester, were more intensively 
utilised between 30/25 BC and AD 20/25, with their occupants continuing to lead apparently 
self-sufficient lives, importing that which they could not manufacture for themselves through 
trading relationships they had forged with merchants elsewhere in Essex (see Chapter 8).
Consequently, it can be said that despite Period 3 occupation at Colchester being consistent
with current thinking on oppida to a greater degree than it had during Periods 1 and 2, and 
Titelberg maintaining its adherence to definitions of these sites to almost the same extent as it 
had during earlier periods of occupation, it can be said that none of the thesis’ case sites 
completely meet with current expectations of oppida. In other words, those characteristics
sought in potential oppida are not wholly reflected within the evidence attributed to Period 3 
occupation at Colchester, Titelberg, and Canterbury. One could therefore conclude that the use 
of the term oppida today needs to be re-evaluated; however, it is not prudent to base this 
inference on the above considerations alone. 
11.4.3.3: A comparison of the thesis’ case sites and Period 3’s best known oppida
As Period 3 marks the emergence of many of Britain’s so-called oppida, (see Chapter 11.4.1), 
it seemed appropriate that occupation at the thesis’ case sites between 30/25 BC and AD 20/25 
was compared to the better known of these. Consequently, this period of occupation at 
Colchester, Titelberg, and Canterbury was compared to that at: Bagendon, Baldock, 
Braughing-Puckeridge (Skeleton Green), Loose, Quarry Wood, Oldbury, Silchester, 
Verulamium, and Wheathampstead in order to further examine the extent to which the term 
oppida remains relevant today.
The site of Bagendon, situated in the Cotswolds, was enclosed by dykes (Moore 2012, 393-
394), and served a number of purposes from domestic occupation (Clifford 1961), arable 
cultivation, and animal husbandry (ibid; Moore 2007, 55) to industry, including metalworking 
and the production of coinage (Clifford 1961; Moore 2007, 55; 2012, 394; forthcoming cf.
Moore 2012, 394; Trow 1982), and long distance trade (Moore 2007, 55; 2012, 395). Similarly, 
the site of Braughing-Puckridge, (Skeleton Green), in Hertfordshire was also used for a 
combination of domestic occupation, farming, and industrial activities (Bryant 2007, 65; 
Mattingly 2007, 76; Partridge 1981); although, in addition to this, it was also utilised as a burial 
complex (Partridge 1979, 28-97 cf. Bryant 2007, 65; Mattingly 2007, 76), and an entrepot for 
503
the trade and distribution of imported wares (Bryant 2007, 65; Bryant and Niblett 1997, 276; 
Mattingly 2007, 76). 
The occupants of Silchester, a fortified settlement (Fulford 2000, Fig.232) in Hampshire, also 
engaged in a combination of domestic occupation, both arable and pastoral farming regimes, 
and domestic/industrial craft production (Fulford 2000, 552-555; Fulford and Timby 2000). 
This site’s industrial activities saw its craftsmen engaging in blacksmithing, bronze-smithing, 
the production of silver jewellery and ceramics, weaving (Fulford 2000, 548 – 558), and the 
minting of coinage (Boon 1957, 56; 1974, 42). Furthermore, Silchester is cited to have been a 
tribal centre (Boon 1974, 38-42) whose occupants had strong economic ties with the near 
Continent and thus engaged in long-distance trade (Boon 1957, 60-61; 1974, 42; Fulford 2000, 
559). 
Verulamium was also used for a combination of domestic occupation and farming regimes 
(Dimbleby 1978, 114; Haselgrove and Millett 1997, 284; Niblett 1999; Stead and Rigby 1989, 
112-218; Thompson 1982, 865-945), in addition to, industrial activities that included the 
production of pottery, textiles, metalwork, and coinage (Bryant and Niblett 1997, 273-274). 
Furthermore, the residents of Verulamium partook in long-distance trade (Dimbleby 1978, 114; 
Niblett 1999; Stead and Rigby 1989, 112-218; Thompson 1982, 865-945); whilst the area 
occupied by Folly Lane (Niblett 1993; 2006) acted as both a ritual centre and burial complex 
(Bryant and Niblett 1997, 273-274; Haselgrove and Millett 1997, 286). 
Meanwhile, the so-called oppida of Oldbury (Cunliffe 1976a, 145; Ward-Perkins 1944) and 
Loose, Quarry Wood (Cunliffe 1976a, 145; Kelly 1972) have, until recent years, always been 
cited to have served only as centres of refuge during times on need (Kelly 1972; Ward-Perkins 
1944). Consequently, these sites appear to have been very different to those considered above. 
However, recent work at Loose, Quarry Wood, a lowland settlement (Howell 2014, 10) 
surrounded by earthworks (Elsden 2006, 12), has revealed that this site, like the nearby Furfield 
Quarry complex, which Kelly (1972) viewed as part of the oppidum, was likely occupied 
domestically and used for the production of metalwork (Howell 2014, 46) and ceramics (ibid, 
48). It has also been postulated that this site was used to mint coinage prior to the Claudian 
Conquest (Cunliffe 1982b, 40-47 cf. Howell 2014, 40). In light of these recent developments 
in our understanding of Quarry Wood, it is possible that the aforementioned interpretation of 
Oldbury is flawed and future research will expand our knowledge of this site also.
504
Finally, our attention turns to the so-called oppida of Baldock and Wheathampstead. 
Occupation at these sites differs from that at many of those considered above; although some 
overlap is visible. Baldock is regularly cited as both a centre of religious/cult activities (Bryant 
2007, 69; Bryant and Niblett 1997, 278), and a political/administrative hub (Bryant 2007, 69); 
while Wheathampstead is believed to a have served ritual/ceremonial functions, in part because 
of its proximity to the Devil’s Dyke (ibid, 74). These sites can therefore be said to compare, 
to a degree, to all those sites to have displayed religious/political import; however, one must 
be cautious of the extent to which we promote this notion, because these activities cannot be 
said to have characterised the other sites to the same magnitude that they do Baldock and 
Wheathampstead.
In light of the above, it can be said that, with the exception of Oldbury, Colchester, and 
Titelberg share something in common with all of the so-called oppida considered above; whilst 
occupation at Canterbury can be compared to that at Bagendon, Braughing-Puckridge, 
Silchester, Verulamium, and Loose, Quarry Wood. In other words, Colchester, Titelberg, and
Canterbury all compare to those so-called oppida designed to function as domestic centres 
utilised for the purposes of inhabitation, farming, and craft production; in addition to those,
whose occupants engaged in long distance trade; whilst Colchester and Titelberg can also be 
linked to those sites that had areas dedicated to ritual/religious activities. Consequently, this 
comparative study, like that detailed in Chapter 11.4.3.1 above, can be said to further call into 
question the relevance of the term oppida today; because we are once more faced with clear 
evidence to suggest that those settlements labelled thus are not part of a uniform category as 
the term might lead us to believe. 
11.3.3.4: A comparison of the thesis’ case sites and contemporaneous non-oppida
The final comparative study conducted in relation to Period 3 occupation at Colchester, 
Titelberg, and Canterbury compares these sites to a number of settlements that have never been 
labelled oppida, in order to assess the value of the this term today. Three of the better known 
sites that can be said to fall into this category, that is Gussage-All-Saints, and the Glastonbury 
and Meare Lake Villages, were also occupied during Period 2 and as such were considered in 
relation to occupation at the case sites at this time (see Chapter 11.3.3.4). As occupation at the 
thesis’ case sites did not alter in terms of the principal activities the site’s occupants engaged 
505
in between Periods 2 and 3 the author feels justified in stating here that occupation at 
Colchester, Titelberg, and Canterbury continued to compare to that taking place at these sites.
In addition to the above, Period 3 saw a number of new sites emerge within the landscapes of 
both Britain and Temperate Europe. The sites of Wetwang and Garton Slack in Britain were 
used for a combination of domestic occupation, farming pursuits, and craft production; whilst 
also doubling as burial complexes (Brewster 1980; Dent 1983, Fig. 3; Giles 2007). While, the 
site of Aulnat in Gaul was utilised for domestic occupation, arable cultivations, and industrial 
activities (Haselgrove 1996a, 144).
Like those settlements also occupied during Period 2 the non-oppida outlined above can be 
said to compare to Colchester, Titelberg, and Canterbury. All three sites compare to Aulnat,
while the religious activities conducted at Wetwang and Garton Slack can be said to link these 
sites more closely with Colchester and Titelberg than Canterbury. Additionally, it can be said 
that the similarities between the thesis’ case sites and non-oppida settlements noted above 
highlight parallels between the non-oppida and the comparative oppida considered in Chapter
11.3.3.3. That is to say, with the exception of Oldbury, Baldock, and Wheathampstead 
occupation at the comparative oppida can be said to compare to that taking place at GussageAll-Saints, the Glastonbury and Meare Lake Villages, Wetwang and Garton Slack, and Aulnat. 
Meanwhile, Baldock and Wheathampstead’s religious import can be said to link these 
settlements to Wetwang and Garton Slack which doubled as burial complexes. Consequently, 
we are once again left wondering why some of these sites have been labelled oppida, but not 
others.
In light of the above observations, we have to once again return to the initial definition of socalled oppida as large fortified settlements if we hope to gain an answer to this question, as 
these are the only characteristics that have not been noted in conjunction with the non-oppida
considered above. However, even these features cannot be said to provide a satisfactory answer 
to this question. Although occupation at Colchester, Titelberg, and Canterbury, as well as the 
comparative oppida, was spread over sizable tracts of their respective landscapes, they were 
not all fortified. Furthermore, the non-oppida noted above were all of a fair size, that is to say 
that while they may not have been as big as the so-called oppida they were also not as small as 
some of this period’s farmsteads; additionally, many of the non-oppida occupied during Period 
2 as well as Period 3 were fortified (see Chapter 11.3.3.4). Accordingly, the author surmised 
506
that it is the opinions and beliefs of those writing about these sites that govern whether they are 
labelled oppida or not; a conclusion that adds weight to earlier conclusions to this effect (see 
Chapters 11.2.3.4 and 11.3.3.4).
11.5: Period 4: AD 25/30 – 50
11.5.1: Period 4 within the context of the later Iron Age
This c.25 year period marks the end of the later Iron Age in much of Britain and some areas of 
Temperate Europe20. This led to some areas, particularly the south-east of Britain, being 
exposed to greater contact with the Roman World, a process that would eventually spark a 
decline in native practices and an upsurge in Roman culture. Although this latter development 
did not take place until after AD 50, a number of advancements were witnessed in both Britain 
and Temperate Europe at this time.
In Temperate Europe, but particularly Gaul, the aforementioned advancements took the form 
of an intensification of those developments witnessed in this region between 30/25 BC and AD
20/25. Consequently, Period 4 saw a greater number of Roman towns emerge within the Gallic 
landscape,
21 which ultimately led to an increase in Roman administration and a diminishment 
of native settlements in some parts of the region (Woolf 1998, 116).
Meanwhile, in Britain much appears to have remained the same as it had during Period 322 (see 
Chapter11.4.1), until AD 43 when Claudius’ army invaded Britain; landing in Kent before then 
advancing on Colchester with Claudius at its head (Blair 1963, 36; Creighton 2006, 61, 69; 
Dunnett 1975, 31; Grainge 2005, 11, 117; James 2001, 29; James and Rigby 1997, 82; 
Mattingly 2007, 95-96; Millett 1990, 42). After taking Colchester, the troops advanced on 
much of lowland Britain, (Blair 1963, 36-46; Dunnett 1975, 32; Grainge 2005, 11; James 2001, 
30-31; Mattingly 2007, 96), forging alliances with many tribes (Blair 1963, 36-46; James 2001, 
30-31). However, not all alliances were forged peaceably, with tribes in the north and west of 
the island proving particularly resistant to Roman rule (Blair 1963, 36-46; James 2001, 30-31; 
James and Rigby 1997, 83). These are however, not the only changes to have taken place after 
AD 43. 
 
20 In some regions, such as Scandinavia, where the Roman’s never gained control the Iron Age continued into 
the Medieval period.
21 This process started earlier in southern Gaul but eventually spread north (Woolf 1988, 116).
22 At least in so far as this is what existing evidence suggests.
507
By AD 49 a colonia of veterans had been established at Colchester that not only led to a 
permanent Roman population at this site (Blair 1963, 44; Creighton 2006, 61-110; Dunnett 
1975, 45; Tacitus Annales 21.32), but the appearance of a fortress at Gosbecks (Creighton 
2006, 62; Wilson 1977) and eventually a legionary fortress at Sheepen (Dunnett 1975, 33; 
Creighton 2006, 61, 69). Further to this, the last decade of Period 4 saw another legionary base 
established at Lincoln on the fringes of Roman control (Blair 1963, 44); a number of Claudian 
forts emerge throughout the British landscape, but particularly in the area of the Trinovantian 
canton (Dunnett 1975, 39, Fig. 12), and the first stages in the process to turn Silchester into a 
Roman town were undertaken (Creighton 2006, 135-136). 
11.5.2: Period 4 occupation at the thesis’ case sites
11.5.2.1: Colchester
Period 4 occupation at Colchester was, in many respects, identical to that which occurred at 
this site during Period 3 (see Chapter 11.4.2.1). In other words, Sheepen continued to function 
as a port; whilst also doubling as an industrial centre and potential seat of domestic occupation 
(see Chapter 7.3.4.3). Both Gosbecks and The Garrison meanwhile maintained their positions 
as farmsteads, whose occupants engaged in not only arable and pastoral farming regimes, but 
craft production too (see Chapter 7.3.4.3). Furthermore, Period 4 also saw Sheepen and 
Gosbecks retain their use as religious centres (see Chapter 7.3.4.3). 
Conversely, despite much remaining the same at Colchester, with regards to its core functions, 
during Period 4 there were a number of developments witnessed at this site that can be said to 
have altered the site’s social, economic, and power connotations. One of the most 
archaeologically visible of these, was the emergence of a mint at Sheepen that was responsible 
for the production of Cunobelin’s coinage (see pages 216, 219; Appendices 7.4, 7.20). This 
development not only tells us that the site’s metalworking industries expanded their repertoires 
after AD 20/25, but alludes to the fact that the site as a whole gained in political prominence. 
That is to say, Colchester likely came to be viewed as a settlement of status within the Essex 
landscape, if it had not been before, because of its connection to Cunobelin and his coinage 
(see page 219); just had been the case for Titelberg during Periods 1 and 2 when it had been 
responsible for the minting of the Treveri’s coinage (see Chapter 11.2.2.2 and 11.3.2.2).
508
Furthermore, the appearance of this coinage can be said to highlight the strengthening of 
relationships between Britain and the Roman World at this time, as many of the coins produced 
at this mint bear imagery we would typically associate with Roman culture (see page 216; 
Appendix 7.4). The coinage is, however, not the only evidence attributed to this period to 
denote the strengthening of relationships between Britain and the Near Continent. Period 4 
also witnessed an increase in the number of continental wares entering the site by way of 
trading centres in Gaul, (see Figure 7.45; Appendix 7.19), as well as the adoption of Roman 
cultural practices by certain members of Colchester’s population; namely the elite. This latter 
process is best illustrated by the grave goods interred alongside the deceased at the Stanway 
Cemetery (see Figure 7.47; Appendices 7.19-7.20), (a new feature of Colchester’s landscape 
for Period 4), in particular the gaming paraphernalia, inkwell, and probably the surgical kit (see 
pages 225-226).
Finally, increasing relationships between Colchester and the Roman World were also 
evidenced by the site’s developing morphology. The ties to the Roman World noted above can 
be said to have led to an expanding economy, and a change in the way that Colchester’s elite 
displayed their social standing; the developments to which our attentions now turn affected the 
site’s society as a whole, as it led to frequent, and direct contact, between native and Roman 
populations. After AD 43, and Claudian’s success at Colchester, a fortlet was established at 
Gosbecks; this was then followed 6 years later by the construction of a fort within the colonia
established just outside of Sheepen (see page 221). These processes resulted in a permanent 
Roman population at Colchester, and ultimately increased the level of influence the Roman 
World had on native practices in the south-east of Britain. It is however, prudent to note that 
despite these significant alterations to the site’s morphology native practices continued to 
prevail, even after AD 50; this is best evidenced by the Stanway Cemetery, a native burial 
complex, where mourners observed burial rites mirroring those followed at the Lexden 
Tumulus in c.15 BC (see pages 220, 222). This was therefore a period of considerable change 
for the occupants of Colchester, even if the site’s primary functions remained unchanged.
11.5.2.2: Titelberg
Period 4 marks a time of significant change at Titelberg. Many have attributed the dramatic 
changes witnessed at this site to the emergence of the new Treverian capital at Trier (Daval 
2008; Metzler et al. 1999, 15); for the purposes of the current study however cause is not 
509
relevant. Instead, we are interested in the fact that while the site was not functioning on the 
same level as it once had, it was not abandoned at this time.
The evidence attributed to Period 4 occupation at Titelberg suggests that the site continued to 
be used as both an industrial and religious centre (see Chapter 9.3.4.3). However, there is 
limited evidence to suggest that the site retained its position as a centre where domestic 
occupation was coupled with farming activities at this time (see Chapters 9.3.4.1-9.3.4.2). 
Consequently, it is possible to surmise that Titelberg was no longer associated with a ‘live-in’ 
population, but rather frequented by those working in its industries, which continued to produce 
both ceramics and metalwork at this time (see pages 376, 380-382; Figure 9.62; Appendices 
2.29).
Furthermore, Period 4 also saw Titelberg continue to receive imported goods, (see Figure 9.65)
by way of trading centres in Gaul (see page 382). It is therefore possible that the site, in the 
apparent absence of domestic occupation, came to be identified as an economic hub from 
whence both local and continental wares could be obtained (see page 382).
Finally, it is not only within the evidence associated with Titelberg’s plateau that a decline in 
the site’s occupation can be identified. The cemetery of Lamadelaine also waned in 
prominence over the course of Period 4, with only one burial being interred at the site during 
the c.25 years this period spanned (see page 383; Appendix 9.30). Consequently, it can be said 
that Titelberg went from a flourishing centre of activity to one frequented only for economic 
gain over the course of the c.200 years this thesis considers.
11.5.2.3: Canterbury
Period 4 occupation at Canterbury was very similar to that which had come before it. In other 
words, this site continued to be used for domestic occupation coupled with arable cultivation, 
animal husbandry, and craft production (see Chapters 10.3.4.2-10.3.4.3); the latter of these 
processes saw Canterbury’s craftsmen engage in metalworking, weaving, and potentially 
ceramic production (see pages 457, 459). Furthermore, this period also saw the site’s occupants 
continue to receive, and consume, products from elsewhere in Kent as well as the near 
Continent (see page 457; Figure 10.36; Appendix 10.19). The continued existence of the 
former of these trading relationships led to the inference that Canterbury’s residents continued 
to rely upon local trading relationships for products they would have utilised on a daily basis, 
510
in this case ceramics, (see page 457); whilst the sustainment of economic relationships with 
the near Continent continued to give rise to those products reserved for use by the elite and/or 
at events of communal significance (see page 457).
Conversely, whilst much can be said to have remained unchanged in terms of the activities 
pursued at Canterbury, Period 4 has also been demonstrated to mark an apparent decline in the 
use of the Marlowe Car-park site (see Chapter 10.3.4.2). The author surmised that this process 
could be explained by either a shift in focus within the area now occupied by the modern city, 
or alternatively the nature of the archaeological excavations conducted in this region of the 
city. That is to say, it is possible that the Marlowe Car-park site was superseded by a settlement 
situated elsewhere in Canterbury, (one that has yet to be identified archaeologically), or 
excavations at this site did not target areas occupied at this time (see page 451). Despite this 
development, occupation at Canterbury as a whole cannot be said to have suffered; that is to 
say the site continued to function as a flourishing centre with close ties, economic and social, 
to both its hinterland and the near Continent.
11.5.3: A series of comparisons
11.5.3.1: A comparison of occupation at the thesis’ case sites
Period 4 occupation at the thesis’ case sites can be said to both differ and compare; however, 
this period saw occupation at Titelberg differ from that at either Colchester or Canterbury to a 
greater degree than during Periods 1 to 3. That is to say, for the first time the core activities at 
these settlements cannot be paralleled. 
Although all three sites continued to be used for craft production, only Colchester and 
Canterbury maintained their roles as centres for domestic occupation coupled with mixed 
farming regimes. Furthermore, industrial activities continued to form a fundamental part of 
daily life at Titelberg, (just as they had been during Period 3 (see Chapter 11.4.3.1)), and as 
such can be said to have had more bearing on this site’s existence than either Colchester or 
Canterbury’s. Similarly, it can be said that despite all three sites continuing to engage in longdistance trade it was at Colchester where this activity governed, in part, the reasons for the 
site’s existence.
In addition to the above, it can be said that the continued use of both Colchester and Titelberg 
for religious purposes set these sites apart from Canterbury where no evidence to this end has 
511
been recovered. This is, however, not the only difference that can be said to exist between the 
thesis’ case sites with regards to their religious pursuits. The founding of the Stanway 
Cemetery during Period 4 at Colchester sets this site apart from the other two because the 
cemetery of Lamadelaine at Titelberg ceased to be used at this time, and no evidence of a later 
Iron Age cemetery has yet been recovered at Canterbury.
Consequently, Period 4 occupation at the thesis’ case sites saw Canterbury continue to differ 
considerably from both Colchester and Titelberg in terms of the additional activities these sites 
supported. Moreover, this timeframe marked a considerable decline in Titelberg’s occupation. 
It can therefore be stated that the above observations further demonstrate how the thesis’ case 
sites cannot be considered part of a uniform category of settlement to the extent that their 
characterisation as oppida suggests they were. That is to say, this inference reaffirms similar 
conclusions drawn in relation to occupation at Colchester, Titelberg, and Canterbury between 
Periods 1 and 3.
11.5.3.2: How does occupation at the thesis’ case sites compare to current thinking on oppida?
Occupation at Colchester, Titelberg, and Canterbury between the years of AD 25/30 and 50 
can be said to comply with current thinking on oppida to differing degrees. Period 4 occupation 
at Canterbury adheres to the definitions of oppida published within the literature, (see Chapter 
2), to the same extent that the site’s Period 3 occupation had, (see Chapter 11.4.3.2); 
consequently, it is unnecessary to detail this site’s compliance here.
Similarly, Period 4 occupation at Colchester can be said to meet the same prerequisites of 
oppida as during Period 3, (see Chapter 11.4.3.2), but with two differences. This period of saw 
Colchester utilised to mint the coinage of Cunobelin, a process that can be said to have led to 
the site gaining a political focus. Consequently, Colchester can be said to have come closer to 
adhering to the characteristics said to denote urbanism at potential oppida than during any of 
the earlier periods of the later Iron Age considered herein. In fact, it is only an absence of a 
formalised settlement plan at this time that can be said to prevent the site’s complete 
compliance on this point. 
The development of the aforementioned mint, and the site’s connection to Cunobelin, was also 
at the heart of the second change witnessed in Colchester’s adherence to current definitions of 
oppida. In minting Cunobelin’s coinage Colchester became visibly tied to the Catuvellauni; 
512
the tribe that Cunobelin is said to have presided over, (see Chapter 7.2). Consequently, 
Colchester can be viewed as a tribal centre at this time, and in being so further display the 
political characteristics desired of potential oppida. It is therefore evident that the only defining 
features of oppida not reflected in Period 4 occupation at Colchester are: a formal street plan, 
and evidence to suggest that the site’s principal purposes included its use as an industrial centre 
and burial complex.
Finally, our attention turns to Titelberg and its compliance with current thinking on oppida. 
During Periods 1 to 3 this site adhered to definitions of this term more fully than either 
Colchester or Canterbury; Titelberg’s Period 4 occupation, on-the-other-hand, sees this site 
comply to a far lesser degree. Although Titelberg continued to cover a considerable tract of 
land and display evidence of fortifications at this time, alterations to the site’s functions, in 
particular the absence of domestic occupation, after AD 25 prevented it meeting the urban 
requirements of oppida. Furthermore, this period of occupation, like that which came before 
it, (see Chapter 11.4.3.2), continued to see an absence of a political/administrative centre and 
tribal/elite residence at Titelberg; whilst the extent to which the site engaged in long distance 
trade prevented the author from considering this one of its primary functions. Consequently, 
it can be said that, size and fortifications aside, of the characteristics sought in potential oppida
Titelberg adhered only through its use as both an industrial and religious centre during Period 
4. 
It is therefore evident that Colchester, Titelberg, and Canterbury do not comply with current 
definitions of oppida to the extent one would expect of a site labelled thus; accordingly the 
above comparative study can be said to call into question the relevance of this term today. 
11.5.3.3: A comparison of the thesis’ case sites and Period 4’s best known oppida
The best known examples of oppida occupied between AD 25/30 and 50 are those which were 
also occupied during Period 3, and considered in Chapter 11.4.3.3 above. Occupation at: 
Bagendon, Baldock, Braughing-Puckridge (Skeleton Green), Loose, Quarry Wood, Oldbury, 
Silchester, Verulamium, and Wheathampstead remained largely unaltered between Periods 3 
and 4, thus it is unnecessary to reiterate these sites’ functions here. Instead, our attentions turn 
to a consideration of whether occupation at the thesis’ case sites continued to compare to that 
at these so-called oppida; however, as much remained unchanged in terms of the principal 
activities engaged in at both Colchester and Canterbury this consideration is brief.
513
Period 4 occupation at Colchester continued to parallel that at all of the aforementioned 
settlements with the exception of Oldbury, which is cited to have acted solely as a place of 
refuge during times of need (see Chapter 11.4.3.3). Occupation at Canterbury meanwhile, can 
be said to have maintained its close resemblance to that at Bagendon, Braughing-Puckridge, 
Silchester, Quarry Wood, and Verulamium; but not Baldock, Oldbury, and Wheathampstead 
(see Chapter 11.4.3.3).
Despite the drastic changes witnessed at Titelberg over the course of Period 4, this site too can 
be said to share something in common with all of the comparative oppida noted above, with 
the exception of Oldbury. Titelberg, like all but Baldock and Wheathampstead, was used for 
industrial activities, whilst its religious centre links it, to a certain degree, with Baldock, 
Verulamium, and Wheathampstead. Furthermore, these similarities and differences between 
the case sites and comparative oppida can be said to highlight the non-compliance of the latter 
group with current definitions of this term.
Consequently, despite occupation at Colchester, Titelberg, and Canterbury continuing to 
resemble that conducted at the comparative oppida considered both here and in conjunction
with their Period 3 occupation, (see Chapter 11.4.3.3), these similarities are not enough for 
these sites to be considered part of a uniform class of settlement. In other words, the labelling 
of these sites oppida, a term that promotes notions of uniformity, (see Chapter 2), likely 
overshadows their individuality. These observations can therefore be said to further suggest 
that our use of the term oppida today needs to be re-evaluated.
11.5.3.4: A comparison of the thesis’ case sites and contemporaneous non-oppida
As was the case with the comparative oppida noted above, many of the best known non-oppida
sites of Period 4 date are those whose occupation also spanned Period 3 (see Chapter 11.4.3.4); 
namely: the Lake Villages (Cunliffe 2005, 266; Minnitt and Coles 1996), and both Wetwang 
Slack and Garton Slack (Brewster 1980; Dent 1983, Fig. 3; Giles 2007). In light of this, it can 
be said that the oppida continued to have as much in common with the non-oppida settlements 
during this the final phase of their later Iron Age occupation as they had during Period 3 (see 
Chapter 11.4.3.4). 
514
In addition to the above, a number of new settlements emerged within the British landscape 
over the course of Period 4 whose occupation can too be compared to that at Colchester, 
Titelberg, and Canterbury. Both Little Waltham (Drury 1978a; 1978b), and Mucking (Going 
1993; McDonnell 1993, 22) can be said to fall into this category. Occupation of both of these
settlements was characterised by the same core activities; that is, domestic occupation coupled 
with mixed farming regimes, and craft production. Therefore, these sites like those listed above 
can be said to share much in common with not only the thesis’ case sites, (although to a lesser 
degree in the case of Titelberg), but the majority of the comparative oppida noted in Chapter 
11.5.3.3.
23
Consequently, we are once again left questioning why sites such as Colchester, Titelberg, and 
Canterbury are considered oppida but not those such as Little Waltham and Mucking. As with 
earlier contemplations of this question it is the initial definitions of oppida as large fortified 
settlements that may be the key to understanding this divide. However, these features are not 
unique to the so-called oppida considered herein in conjunction with Period 4. In other words 
the non-oppida noted were also of a reasonable size, with many of them also showing signs of 
having been palisaded. The author was therefore left with only one possible conclusion: that 
the decision to label a site an oppidum was at the purview of those studying it.
 
23 Only Baldock and Wheathampstead as religious and administrative centres, and Oldbury as a refuge can be said 
to differ, in terms of their primary functions, from both Little Waltham and Mucking.
515
12: Conclusions
Over the course of the preceding 11 chapters the author has examined current thinking on 
oppida, the prevalent themes of the later Iron Age, as well as occupation at Colchester, 
Titelberg, and Canterbury; three of the period’s purported oppida. The purpose of the current 
chapter is to highlight the inferences borne through the author’s analyses of Colchester, 
Titelberg, and Canterbury before bringing them together to ascertain an overall answer to the 
thesis’ research question: ‘is the term oppida still valid today?’ Furthermore, the author will 
complete both this chapter and the thesis by considering the direction future work on this 
subject should take.
Through analyses of the archaeological records compiled for Colchester, Titelberg, and 
Canterbury the author established that each of these settlements was used for a combination of 
domestic occupation, farming regimes, and craft production at some point during the later Iron 
Age; for Colchester this was Periods 3 and 4, Titelberg Periods 1 to 3, and Canterbury Periods 
1 to 4, although there was an arguable lull in this site’s activities during Period 2. Additionally,
Periods 3 and 4 saw Colchester act as both a port-of-trade and religious centre, (features that 
may also have been present at the site during Periods 1 and 2, but further research is needed to 
confirm this), whilst the site’s Period 4 artefact record suggests that it was a tribal centre at this 
time. Occupation at Titelberg for the duration of the later Iron Age meanwhile, saw this site 
associated with a religious focus, whilst the scope of its craft production activities make it
probable that it was also an industrial centre. Furthermore, between Periods 1 and 3 Titelberg 
acted as a mint for the Treveri, (the local Gallic tribe), and as such can be said to have been 
both a political foci and tribal centre between 150/100 BC and AD 20/25. The evidence 
associated with Canterbury, on-the-other-hand, produced little to suggest the site’s occupants 
engaged in anything other than traditional Iron Age pursuits.
The above inferences saw the author surmise, in Chapter 11, that although Colchester, 
Titelberg, and Canterbury were similar, in terms of the core activities they supported, it was 
their differences that truly characterised their purpose. Consequently, as these sites are all said 
to have been oppida, a class of settlement whose core activities are by general consensus 
perceived to have overlapped, the author felt justified in stating that this conclusion alone could 
call into question the relevance of the term oppida today. Furthermore, this observation 
516
allowed the author to ponder an answer to one of the thesis’ sub-aims: a consideration of 
whether settlements situated in two very different geographic locations can be encompassed by 
the same term. 
As the core activities of Colchester and Canterbury, two valley bottom settlements, and 
Titelberg, a plateau site, overlap it would appear that topographic setting had little bearing on 
these settlements similarities and differences. However, Titelberg’s elevated position and 
location a short distance from, rather than on, its region’s waterways would have made it 
difficult for this site to have controlled trade to the same degree that Colchester apparently did, 
and it is purported, within the literature, that Canterbury may have done. Consequently, if one 
of the defining characteristics of oppida is that they had direct control of long-distance trade it 
can be said that the differences observed here could prevent the case sites from being 
encompassed by the same term, and as such further call into question its relevance today. This 
latter point becomes all the more pertinent when we take into account the fact that many of the 
oppida in Temperate Europe are situated on plateaus, thus setting them apart, topographically,
from their low-lying contemporaries in south-east Britain and some areas of Temperate Europe, 
(Paris (Lutetia) and Villeneuve-Saint-Germain (Roymans 1990, 200). In fact, the author 
believes it possible that an in-depth study on this topic in its own right could reveal a plethora 
of differences between these sites that are rooted in their geography; because after all the 
geographic setting of a settlement largely dictates the activities their occupants are able to 
engage in (Taylor 1997, 193).
Although the aforementioned comparative study was too expansive for inclusion within the 
current thesis, the author did compare their interpretations of occupation at Colchester, 
Titelberg, and Canterbury with the definitions of oppida comprising current thinking on this 
class of settlement; before then contemplating how well occupation at these sites can be said 
to have compared to that at their contemporaries. The former of these studies led the author to 
surmise that at no point over the course of the later Iron Age did Colchester, Titelberg, and 
Canterbury wholly comply with the definitions of oppida presented within the literature, as 
there were always one to two parameters that remained unmet; but particularly the presence of 
formalised street plans at both Colchester, and Canterbury, and the use of any of these sites as 
funerary complexes. This observation can therefore be said to further call into question the 
relevance of the term oppida today.

Conversely, it is not only the non-compliance of Colchester, Titelberg, and Canterbury to the 
prerequisites of oppida that can be said to highlight this need to re-evaluate our use of this term 
today, but the differences in the periods where they demonstrated their greatest adherence to 
it. Occupation at Titelberg most closely complied with current thinking on oppida during 
Periods 1 and 2, whilst that at Colchester most closely adhered to definitions of these sites 
during Period 4; although, Period 3 occupation at both Colchester and Titelberg can also be
said to have conformed to a certain degree. Occupation at Canterbury, on-the-other-hand,
failed to conform to the definitions of these sites presented within the literature in anything 
other than the most fundamental ways. That is to say the only characteristics desired of oppida
reflected in Canterbury’s later Iron Age occupation are its considerable size and its connections 
to both industry and long-distance trade; yet, neither of these latter pastimes were conducted 
on the scale one would expect of a potential oppidum. In light of the above observations one 
would be forgiven for supposing that there were points in both Colchester and Titelberg’s later 
Iron Age chronologies where they could be considered oppida, whilst Canterbury is anomalous
in its characterisation, thus. However, the author suggests that both the incomplete compliance 
of Colchester and Titelberg’s later Iron Age occupation with definitions of this term, and the 
differing periods of their near compliance negate the value of the term oppida. The former 
because applying a term to a site that does not meet with its parameters breeds generalisations 
and ultimately leads to the individual nuances of sites labelled such being overlooked; and the 
latter because the wider contexts of the periods in which Colchester and Titelberg most closely 
comply with definitions of this term are so different it is possible that differing processes led 
to their emergence, and governed the activities they engaged in. In other words, Titelberg 
complies most closely with the term oppida during the earlier periods of the later Iron Age 
when Temperate Europe was privy to increased, and altered, economic relationships with the 
Mediterranean World, and well as extensive developments in the ways in which craft 
production was undertaken. Colchester’s main periods of compliance with the term oppida, 
on-the-other-hand, fall at a time when economic relationships between Britain, Gaul, and the 
Roman world intensified, but as a time when Roman influence was noticeable in Gaul, and as 
such the repercussions of this were witnessed in the goods moving through the aforementioned 
trading relationships. Consequently, if we are ever to fully comprehend the reasons for these 
sites appearance, their functions, and their relationships to other settlements we need to 
consider them more within their Iron Age context and less in the shadow of the term considered 
here.
518
It is, however, not only the thesis’ case sites that can be said to highlight the latter points noted
above. The author’s consideration of these sites in conjunction with some of the later Iron 
Age’s better known oppida demonstrated how the functions of the comparative sites too 
differed and compared. This observation not only further illustrated how those sites currently 
labelled oppida do not comprise the uniform class of settlement we are led to believe they were, 
but also signified the non-compliance of the comparative oppida with existing definitions of 
these settlements.
Moreover, the aforementioned comparative study can also be said to further highlight the 
possibility that there are chronological differences between the oppida that may have governed 
their emergence, use, and eventual decline. The comparative oppida considered in conjunction 
with Period 1 and 2 occupation at Colchester, Titelberg, and Canterbury were all located in 
Temperate Europe, and, for the most part, occupied for the duration of both of these periods; 
although, Period 2 did witness the emergence of a series of new, but short lived, oppida in 
Gaul, in areas where none had previously been situated. By Period 3, however, many of these 
sites had ceased to be occupied, leading the author to identify a series of new comparative sites;
all of which were located in Britain and occupied for the duration of both Periods 3 and 4. 
Should all of the so-called oppida considered over the course of this study have been part of 
the same class of settlement one would be forgiven for suggesting that their gradual appearance 
in Britain over the course of the later Iron Age was indicative of a diffusion of ideas from 
Temperate Europe to Britain. However, the author believed this to be further evidence to 
support the notion that our use of the term oppida today needs to be re-evaluated, because it is 
likely that the short lived sites emerging at the end of Period 1 and into Period 2 did not emerge 
for the same reasons asthe long lived sites in both Britain and Temperate Europe. Furthermore, 
the wider Iron Age context of the sites occupied over the course of both Periods 1 and 2 is very 
different to that into which the sites occupied during Periods 3 and 4 were born; logically, it is
therefore unlikely that they were established for the same reasons. This latter point is further 
substantiated by the earlier notion that whilst the functions of many of these settlements 
overlapped there were still differences, differences that characterised their true purpose and 
reasons for being, and which are most likely overlooked in favour of their status as potential 
oppida.
The final comparative study the author engaged in saw them compare the thesis’ case sites with 
a number of settlements that have never been considered oppida. This process led the author 
519
to conclude that the activities engaged in at the purported oppida were mirrored at some of the 
periods more iconic settlements, settlements that are typically labelled villages or farmsteads. 
In light of this inference, it was necessary to consider what factors may have led to Colchester, 
Titelberg and Canterbury being labelled oppida but not these comparative sites. This 
contemplation saw the author highlight the possible characteristics sought in potential oppida
that may have governed their differentiation from the farmsteads and villages to which the case 
sites were compared: size and fortifications. However, upon further considering the 
comparative sites, it became evident that these characteristics were not exclusive to the 
purported oppida. This led the author to conclude that it was at the purview of those who have
excavated, and published on, potential oppida that these sites were labelled thus. A conclusion 
that in and of itself can be said to call into question the relevance of the term today, but when 
coupled with the inferences noted throughout this chapter could be said to negate the value of 
this term altogether because it demonstrates how seldom the parameters by which it is currently 
bound are observed.
Overall it can be said that the current thesis has demonstrated the shortcomings of the term 
oppida. Current definitions of this term promote generalisations of these sites and their 
functions, preferring to focus on how they are/should be alike rather than appreciating their 
differences, differences that often have more bearing on their true nature than the similarities
between them. Furthermore, the chronological and geographic differences of these sites likely 
had significant impact upon the reasons behind their emergence, functions, and eventual 
decline. Consequently, the author feels justified in stating that current usage of this term is 
limiting, and probably prohibits not only our appreciation of any one so-called oppidum in its 
own right, but a progression in our understanding of the later Iron Age as a whole. That is to 
say, current stigmas associated with this term have helped shape our knowledge of this period, 
and by considering those sites labelled thus from a new perspective, in other words not as part 
of a predefined category, could provide new insights into the later Iron Age that help us to 
better understand the developments witnessed in both Britain and Temperate Europe at this
time. Accordingly, the answer to the thesis’ overarching research question is that the term 
oppida has very little value today. 
Finally, and in light of the conclusions outlined above, the author feels it is prudent to 
contemplate the direction future work on this subject could take. It is clear that in its current 
guise the term oppida has very little value today, and that its continued use in this guise is likely 
520
to limit future studies on the later Iron Age and its settlements. The author therefore feels that 
in order to further both the research considered herein, and our understanding of the later Iron 
Age, all sites currently labelled oppida need to be reconsidered through an in-depth analysis of 
all evidence currently attributed to them, and any new materials that can be obtained through 
additional archaeological investigations, using the thesis’ methodology which highlights the 
value of data in generating an understanding of a sites function(s). In doing this it will be 
important for any characteristics of these sites governed by their periods of occupation and/or 
topographic settings to be highlighted so that a true appreciation of their emergence and 
purpose can be gained. Upon completing this work it will be possible to compare the results 
of these studies so as to ascertain whether there are truly enough similarities between certain 
of these sites for some of them to be classified under one term.
