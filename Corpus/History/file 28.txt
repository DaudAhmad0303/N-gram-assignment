KEY SKILL
Successful note-taking
Right from the first day of your archaeology course you should be taking and filing notes on
what you have learnt . You have probably already developed your own style of note-taking but it
is worth considering alternative forms of note-taking depending on what is required of you and
the purpose of the information you are recording . For example , the type of information you
need to record as the raw material for a major essay is likely to be very different from what is
required to remind you of the meaning of a concept . It is as easy to accumulate too many
notes as too few . The acid test is whether they are useful for their purpose . As Figure 1 . 2
makes clear , different styles of notes are appropriate to different situations . 
Detailed written notes may be necessary when you are working from library texts on a major
project . If you take notes from texts you always have access to , such as The Archaeology
Coursebook , then you are wasting your time . What you want instead are brief notes which
remind you of key points and direct you to places in your texts where the detail is . Try to
experiment with a range of notes when preparing for discussion , revising and planning . Many
people learn better from visual notes than they do from dense written passages . You may be
one of them . We have used these types of notes throughout the text . You can find examples on
the following pages :

Figure 1 . 2 The strengths and weaknesses of different types of notes
map evidence of human activity in the
landscape . The appropriate methods in each
case will relate to the time and resources
available as well as the particular case being
investigated . 
Every year hundreds of new sites are located . 
Some are spotted from the air or even from
satellites in space , others through the discovery
of artefacts by metal detectorists . Quarrying , 
dredging and peat cutting all regularly produce
unexpected finds while some of the most important have come about completely by chance . 
The discoveries of the body of Otzi the Ice
Man by skiers and of the Altamira cave art by
children are classic examples . So too was the
discovery of the Neolithic tomb at Crantit in
Orkney , which was found when a digger fell
through the roof ! 
Equally , some sites were never ‘ lost ’ to begin
with . Stonehenge and the Pyramids were well
known before the development of archaeology
and many of the buildings of the last 200 years
are still in use . Other named sites were
documented by historians and located by using
written sources . Schliemann ’ s discovery of Troy
is the classic example but many historic battlefields also fall into this category . In addition , a
considerable number of new discoveries are
made during the exploration of known sites . 
Where archaeologists are actively trying to
locate or explore sites through research or
ahead of development there are four broad and
complementary categories of methods that 
they use : 
■ desktop study
■ surface survey
■ geophysical or geochemical survey
■ aerial survey
In addition there are a range of newer
techniques , most of which can be labelled
remote sensing .

DESKTOP STUDY
As its name suggests , this is an office-based
investigation using existing records . Some
archaeologists , usually concerned with
shipwrecks , aircraft or the investigation of
historical individuals , continue to use written
sources to track down or identify particular
sites . More generally , most excavations and all
research in Britain today begins with a search
of information that has already been recorded . 
The majority of these investigations are part of
the planning process and their purpose is to
determine whether there are likely to be
archaeological remains which might be
threatened by development ( see p . 111 )  . 
Desktop study involves researching maps and
historical or archaeological documents including aerial photographs about the area under
investigation . If they are not in private hands , 
these are most likely to be held in planning
departments , county records offices , local Sites
and Monuments Record ( SMRs ) or the
National Monuments Record ( NMR ) offices . 

Historical documents
A diverse assortment of documents may be of
value to the archaeologist . These will vary by
county , area and period . In most parts of the
country known documents are archived or
recorded in the County Records Office . In
many areas , useful sources have also been
catalogued in a volume of the Victoria County
History ( VCR ) which is often the first resource
researchers turn to . Only a fraction of early
records have survived and those that have need
translation and interpretation . Amongst the
potential range available , the following
categories are important . 
Legal documents . Records of ownership such
as Anglo-Saxon charters or court records of
disputes often included physical description of
boundaries and occasionally land use . Wills and
inventories which can be linked to particular
buildings can provide lists of contents which
provide clues to function . 
Tax records . These are particularly valuable in
helping to identify landowning units and their
economic uses . The Domesday Book is the best
known but later tax surveys and tithe awards
are often of more direct use . 
Economic records . Order and sales books are
invaluable to industrial archaeologists while
nineteenth-century directories are useful in
exploring functions of buildings . Estate agents ’ 
bills are increasingly being preserved to record
changes in important buildings . 
Pictorial records . Paintings , engravings and
photographs can be of value both in identification and in tracing changes . They are
particularly valuable when studying standing
buildings . Archives of aerial photographs ( APs ) 
such as the RAF surveys of Britain in the 1940s
are key documents in tracing landscape change
in the last sixty years and are often the only
record of many sites . 
Written accounts . Descriptions of places in
books , diaries and travelogues are of use in
identifying the function , construction methods
and identity of many sites . The work of early
antiquarians such as Stukeley is particularly
valuable for descriptions of monuments as they
were before the modern period . 
Archaeological records . There are three main
sources here . If there are previous excavation
or survey results they can often be accessed
through libraries or local museums . Local

collections of finds and reports will also be
held in local museums . Details of previous
archaeological work and stray finds for much
of Britain are held in local SMRs . These
records are increasingly computerised and a
national version is being built up at the various
NMR offices . Printouts which include lists of
earlier research can be made by inputting grid
references . 
Oral accounts . While living people may
provide clues to the use and location of recent
buildings , farmers and others who work on the
land or the built environment may have
valuable knowledge for archaeologists . Farmers , 
for example , may be able to identify areas
where building rubble has been ploughed up or
where dressed stones have been removed . 
Sometimes estate management records may
hold this information for earlier periods . 
Maps
Maps are amongst the most basic tools and
sources used by archaeologists . They are used
to locate and explore sites and to answer
questions about previous use of the landscape . 
They are of particular value in tracking changes
through time ( settlement shape and location , 
boundaries , land units , fields and hedges )  . They
can also be used to relate sites to geology and
topography . Medieval archaeologists are often
able to produce their own maps for periods
before mapping began . They do this by
working back from the oldest available map
and cross-referencing historical sources and
fieldnames . This technique is known as
regression . 
A wide variety of maps are used by archaeologists , including the following . 
Early maps
Maps from the sixteenth century tend to show
properties . They are not always to scale but
may provide visual aspects such as illustrations
of specific buildings . From the seventeenth
century there are also route maps such as
Ogilvy ’ s Road Book , which is a series of linear
strips . Maps were also produced to show the
proposed routes of turnpikes , canals and
railways in order to gain permission from
parliament for building to take place . 
Changes in rural landownership from the
eighteenth century onwards were recorded on
enclosure award maps , while taxes paid to the
church by landowners were sometimes written
on tithe award maps . Occasionally these can be
cross-referenced and both can provide
information about fieldnames , routes and
boundaries , which are vital for landscape
archaeology . Other maps show landscaped
gardens , battlefields or provide plans of
factories and mines . 
These early maps are often held in county
record offices . Some may be in private hands or
belong to churches . 
Ordnance Survey ( OS ) maps
During the early nineteenth century the OS
mapped each county at 1 inch to 1 mile . From
the 1880s OS 6 inch to 1 mile maps provided
more detail of individual buildings and even
hedge species . OS maps established a new
standard in accuracy and a comprehensive
system of coding and keys for features . A grid
system was used which covered the whole
country and enabled precise references to be
given . By examining a succession of maps for
any area , changes in land use and the built
environment can be easily seen .

8 ■ ARCHAEOLOGY COURSEBOOK
Maps used by archaeologists
The OS 1 : 25000 Pathfinder or Leisure series
show the location of some archaeological sites
but planning maps that use the same grid
system are needed for investigations . 1 : 10000 
( old 6 inch ) maps are sometimes the most
detailed available for mountainous and some
rural areas but 1 : 2500 ( old 25 inch 1 mile ) rural
or 1 : 1250 urban planning maps are normally
used . For field walking 1 : 10000 or 1 : 2500 is
used and for excavation the 1 : 2500 or 1 : 1250
provides a base . A 1 : 2500 map allows you to
identify individual metre squares with a 
10-figure grid reference . These maps can be
seen in county or district planning offices . 
Other maps sometimes used include geological
maps , street maps , factory plans , vegetation and
climatic maps , land use and classification , soil
surveys and specialist archaeological maps . 
Increasingly archaeologists are using computerised mapping systems based around
Geographical Information Systems ( GIS )  . 
As an archaeology student you need some basic
map skills including the ability to : 
■ identify and interpret common archaeological features from maps
■ ‘ read ’ contours and hachures
■ use scales and at least 6-figure grid
references
■ produce basic cross-sectional sketches from
maps
■ interpret simple archaeological plans and
diagrams
■ use other evidence such as photographs and
written accounts to interpret maps and
plans .

KEY TERM
Geographic Information Systems ( GIS ) 
This refers to powerful databases which
can store vast amounts of data against
individual map grid references . This can
include details of topography , geology and
vegetation as well as archaeological data . 
It can integrate data from satellites with
field recordings . It can produce
topographic maps and site plans in three
dimensions and perform complex statistical
analysis . It is revolutionising the presentation and interrogation of archaeological
data . On models such as that developed for
Gloucester a vast range of underlying data
can be accessed by pointing and clicking
on the map . 
KEY TASK
Sourcing information
Take each of the following examples and
list the types of source you might find
useful in investigating it . 
Next take a real example of one of them
and find out what actual sources exist . You
may be surprised . 
A round barrow or cairn
A roman villa or Saxon church
A deserted medieval village or abbey
An eighteenth-century farm or canal
A nineteenth-century railway line or
factory
A twentieth-century pillbox or airfield
SURFACE SURVEYS
This term can be used to encompass
fieldwalking , surveying and even planned
aerial photography . We will use it to describe
non-destructive visual surveys at ground level . 
These can range from slow , painstaking
searches on foot to quite rapid examinations of
a landscape by Landrover , looking for
upstanding earthworks . Since most sites lack
visible features , the former is more common . 
This technique is largely concerned with
finding traces of unrecorded sites . Scatters of
building rubble or artefacts or slight
undulations in the surface might reveal where
there are buried walls or house platforms . 
Differences in soil or vegetation may also be
indicative of past human activity . For studies of
the Mesolithic and Neolithic in Britain , 
scatters of flint and animal bone are often the
only traces of human activity visible in the
landscape . To study the activities of these
mobile populations , careful identification and
plotting of these scatters is essential . A
variation on this is the study of hedges and
woodlands for traces of past economic
activities and to help locate settlement areas 
( see p . 175 )  . Surface surveys can cover large
areas such as Webster and Sanders ’ work in the
Copan Valley of Mexico and the Thetford
Forest project in East Anglia .  



research / huancaco / 
For major research studies , the design of
sampling procedures are vital . 
Surface investigations of known sites include
micro-contour surveys of the topography . 
These involve detailed and precise use of
surveying tools to build up a picture of
variations in height and levels . Data is
increasingly being entered on databases to
enable computer enhancement of the landscape . 
These surveys can often reveal hidden features
that could not be detected with the naked eye . 
Recording standing buildings
One specialised area of archaeological
surveying focuses on the built environment and
links archaeology to architectural science . 
Detailed studies of the material and
construction techniques of structures are made
both to enhance knowledge of the development
of buildings and to provide a record against
future destruction or decay . Records will range
between a written description and CAD 
( computer-aided design ) based recording of
every brick or stone . Most recording of
buildings occurs as part of the planning process 
( see p . 111 ) or during conservation work . A
recent variation on this is the current Defence
of Britain project , which is seeking to collect
records on defensive monuments of the Second
World War .

Fieldwalking
Fieldwalking , or surface collection as it is
known in the USA , involves systematic
collection of artefacts from the ploughsoil
which might be indicative of human settlement . 
Ceramics and worked stone are the most
commonly gathered but metal , bone and burnt
stone are often also collected . The method is

Sampling
Whatever is deposited is a fragment of past
material culture . Dependent upon the
material , a variable portion of these deposits
will survive . Archaeologists will recover a
sample of these . Not every site can be
fieldwalked , let alone excavated . Choices have
to be made . If these choices are arbitrary 
( non-probabilistic ) they could lead to bias in
the archaeological record with certain types
of evidence being neglected and others overrepresented . For example , if archaeologists
chose only to study hill forts from the Iron
Age or , as often happens , if development only
permitted excavation in one part of a town , it
might create an unrepresentative picture of
life in the past . 
When archaeologists design research
strategies they use some form of probabalistic
sampling to reduce bias in recovery . This
means that the chance of anything being
recovered is known . Rigorous sampling is used
in most aspects of archaeological
reconnaissance and excavation . It is probably
enough to understand four basic models . For
each of them , the plan of the total area to be
surveyed or the site in question ( the sample
universe ) is divided up by a grid into
numbered units . The units will vary in size
according to the work to be done , for
example , 1  1 metres for test pitting to
large units for surface survey . In some cases a
specified number of transects or samples of
soil will be made in each square . 
A simple random sample works like a lottery . 
The numbered units are selected by computer
or number table . This is fair as each unit has
an equal chance of being selected , but it can
also lead to clustering and thus miss features . 
Stratified sampling overcomes clustering bias
by first dividing the sample universe into
sections . For example , if the site has natural
zones such as hills , valley and plain then
numbers are selected randomly for each zone
in proportion to its area . 
Systematic sampling overcomes clustering by
selecting at evenly spaced intervals , for
example every third grid or every 10 metres .

destructive in that archaeological material is
removed , but as it has been disturbed by
ploughing , it is not in its original context
anyway . 
Decisions about sampling have to be made
when planning fieldwalking . Not everything
will be collected , particularly when building
rubble is involved . For instance , will all
ceramics be collected or just diagnostic pieces ? 
Decisions also have to be taken about the
width of traverses or size of grids and the space
between them . 
Fieldwalkers proceed along a measured section
of a traverse ( called a stint ) or around a grid
collecting material they see lying on the surface
before them . This is usually soon after
ploughing and ideally when rain has cleared
dust from the surface . These finds are bagged
and tagged with the number of the grid or stint
for processing and analysis .

Sampling
This ensures a more even selection although 
it could miss things that are regularly
distributed . It usually requires a higher
number of samples . 
Stratified systematic sampling combines the
last two methods and could be used to take
more samples in particular zones than others .

fieldwalking
Once washed and identified , finds are counted
for each grid or transect . This can then be
plotted on a distribution map to show patterns
and concentrations . There are several ways of
displaying this information . Phase maps or a
series of clear plastic overlays for each period
or type of find are commonly used . Computer
displays using GIS have an edge here since
several types of data can be linked to any point
and comparisons easily made . 
Fieldwalking is a well established method
because it has many strengths . It is a relatively
cheap way of surveying large areas since
volunteer labour can be used to collect and
wash finds . It can help establish the function
and period of a site without excavation and
provide insights into location and exchange .

Grids and transects and traverses
These are areas marked out on archaeological sites or areas being surveyed . They
are ‘ anchored ’ to identifiable points which
link into the national ordnance survey grid , 
enabling evidence to be precisely located . 
They are set up using surveying equipment
and carefully checked for accuracy . Global
positioning systems ( GPS ) and GIS are
increasingly important in this work . 
Typically grids and transects are marked
out with pegs , canes or flags . The same
process is involved in preparation for
fieldwalking , geophysics and excavation .

Fieldwalking can indicate the spread and foci of
evidence . It does , however , have important
limitations too . It is only really useful on arable
land where access has been granted and then
only at certain times in the agricultural cycle . 
In addition , its results cannot be taken at face
value . For example , medieval manuring
practices transferred much domestic refuse to
the ploughsoil , creating a doughnut shape
pattern of pottery distribution . Chris Gerrard ’ s
work on the Shapwick Project has explored
two other major limitations . 
Different materials behave differently in the
same soil . In Shapwick , rewalking the same
fields and monitoring ceramics in them showed
that some material migrates further than others . 
Patterns for pottery from different periods
were also very different . It was not always a
good indication of settlement . A second

variable was the differential collection by
different fieldwalkers . Analysis of their finds
showed that some were good at recognising
and collecting one type of material but poor
with another . This applied to experienced
walkers as well as novices . Their performance
varied according to weather and slope . Taken
together it means that what is recovered is a
sample of what was in the topsoil and the
topsoil holds a sample of what lies below . In
both cases the sample varies for each type of
find . Fieldwalking results therefore need to be
cross-checked with other data before
conclusions can be drawn . 
There are a number of other prospection
methods which provide alternatives to
fieldwalking although all are more destructive . 
Shovel pit testing involves taking a regular
number of buckets from 30 litre topsoil
samples from test pits and sieving to retrieve
finds . This can take place in woods , pasture
and gardens where fieldwalking is impossible . 
It may be a more reliable guide to settlement
location if the area has not been ploughed in
modern times . 
Coring and augering are also used to sample
the subsoil . A device such as a bucket auger is
driven into the ground and it extracts a sample
of the subsoil in the same way as an apple
corer . This can provide a snapshot of the
stratigraphy and the sample can be examined
for artefactual or environmental evidence . 
Probing , which involves driving a rod into the
ground , is more useful for tracing shallow
buried features such as walls on known sites . 
GEOCHEMICAL PROSPECTION
These relatively new methods and expensive
techniques attempt to locate areas of past
human activity by detecting differences in the
chemical properties of the soil . Phosphate
analysis is the best known of these but analysis
of heavy metals such as lead and cadmium and
lipids ( fats ) in the topsoil also has the potential
to be useful . These techniques can also be
applied to intra-site analysis including
buildings . Variations in the combinations of
heavy metals in different rooms may reflect
different activities . 
GEOPHYSICAL SURVEYS
This term covers techniques that detect features
through their physical differences with the
surrounding soil . The most common

KEY STUDY
The Shapwick Project
This long-running investigation of the
development of a village on an estate
owned by Glastonbury Abbey has combined
a full range of reconnaissance techniques
and pioneered new methods including
shovel pit testing and geochemical survey . 
Several generations of students from
Bristol University and King Alfred College , 
Winchester , and members of the public
have contributed . The research has been
notable for the way maps , botany , 
invertebrate studies and historical records
have been combined to produce regression
maps for the village . It has also made a
major contribution to our understanding of
fieldwalking .

techniques detect magnetic and electrical
anomalies and require considerable skill to
interpret . With the increasing involvement of
archaeology in planning development and a
shift in emphasis amongst archaeologists in
favour of preservation rather than excavation , 
these techniques are now commonplace . 
The manufacture of increasingly reliable
instruments for archaeology has seen magnetometry become a standard technique . 

Resistivity survey
There are differences in the ability of different
soils to conduct electricity . This can be detected
by passing an electric current through the
ground and comparing readings . Electricity is
conducted through the soil by mineral salts
contained in water . The more moisture there is
the better the conductivity of the soil . A buried
ditch will generally retain water better than the
surrounding soil . A buried wall will conduct
poorly and therefore resist the current more
than the surrounding soil . Electrical current
flows close to the surface so it can be measured
using shallow probes . The method works better
with some soils than others . Clay retains
moisture well , so differences in resistance
between the soil and buried ditches or pits may
be impossible to detect . Plants , rocks and
variations in the depths of soils can also create
misleading readings . 

beckhampton / 

field_proj / amarsh / project . html
Early resistivity methods involved placing lines
of spikes and wires along the ground , which
made them slow . Today there are mobile units
that look a little like Zimmer frames and have
onboard computers to log readings . While
these are relatively easy to use they are still not
fast and are best suited to detailed exploration
of a small area such as a site , rather than for
prospecting . Resistivity can also be used to
create pseudo sections of buried features . This
involves taking a series of readings from a line
of probes placed across a buried feature such as
a ditch . Wider spacing produces data on deeper
parts of the feature than narrowly spaced
probes . 
The depth to which this technology penetrates
the soil is limited and readings require considerable interpretation , as the sensitivity of the
meters is not great . At Hindwell in Wales , a 4-
metre wide ditch identified by resistivity
turned out after excavation to be a series of
massive postholes with construction ramps . 
Magnetometer surveying
The earth ’ s magnetic field is generally uniform
in any one place . However , local magnetic
16 ■ ARCHAEOLOGY COURSEBOOK

distortions can be caused by past human
activity . Topsoil contains haematite ( Fe2O3 )  , a
form of iron ( Fe )  . In some forms its crystals
are magnetic . A pit dug into the earth will fill
up with topsoil , which will contain concentrations of magnetic material . The fill will
therefore be different magnetically from the
subsoil . A second type of local magnetic
distortion occurs where there have been kilns
or hearths in the past . Heating alters the
magnetic properties of the underlying soil . 
A magnetometer is a sensitive instrument
which can detect such minor anomalies in the
local magnetic field . 
The earliest magnetometers were cumbersome
and slow to use . The development of hand-held
fluxgate gradiometers has enabled the technique
to be used to rapidly scan quite large areas to
highlight anomalies . Magnetometers are also

In Germany caesium magnetometers have been
developed which are incredibly sensitive . One
was brought over recently for work at Stanton
Drew where it detected faint traces of hundreds of concentric postholes . However these
handcart-mounted machines are very expensive . 

StantonDrew / 
To be able to detect anomalies , the magnetic
background of the soil has to be measured and
magnetometers calibrated against it . The
measuring of this magnetic susceptibility of
the topsoil can also be used as a crude survey
technique in its own right . Magnetic hotspots
suggest areas of past settlement or industrial
activity , which could be surveyed using other
methods . 

ld36 / magsus . htm 
Sensitive magnetic instruments are easily
disturbed by iron , including nails , pipes and
wire fences as well as the zips and piercings of
the archaeologist . A further limitation can be
background interference from magnetic
bedrock or where a long period of occupation
has left a magnetic layer over a wide area . 
Sandy and clay soils often do not provide
sufficient contrast . Fluctuations in the earth ’ s
magnetic field also have to be taken into
account . It requires considerable skill and
experience to interpret the results . 
Other methods
Metal detectors are useful for metal objects
down to about 15 cm . These may provide clues
about underlying sites , particularly burials and
therefore could be used as part of wider
surveys . Inexperienced detectorists will waste
time by detecting slag or modern agricultural
debris . Similarly , detectors can be used to
sweep areas in advance of geophysics so that
concentrations of metal can be plotted and
taken into account . 
Ground penetrating radar ( GPR ) which was
developed for defence and engineering is
starting to be used in archaeology . Aerial
versions can highlight buried landscapes and
rivers . Ground versions are useful for detecting
voids and GPR has been particularly effective
in revealing the internal structures of buildings . 
It is the only effective geophysics technique in
city centres where it can even penetrate tarmac . 
However , it remains expensive and is only
useful where burial deposits are close to the
surface . Its value is in addressing specific
questions rather than for general survey .

Although usually classed as geophysics , 
dowsing and bosing are two more traditional
methods that are occasionally used . Skilled
dowsers use wooden sticks to locate water and
some features under water . Bosing involves
hitting the ground with a solid object such as a
mallet and listening for variations in resonant
sounds . These might indicate buried ditches or
walls . 
All of these geophysical techniques are used in
conjunction with grids to map patterns of finds
and variations . All of them are limited in the
type of work they can do and they should
therefore be seen as complementary . None of
them are particularly useful on waterlogged
sites . Their value is often in pinpointing or
exploring features rather than finding new sites . 
AERIAL PHOTOGRAPHY
The first aerial photographs ( APs ) were taken
from balloons and they are sometimes still
used . Today , most photographs are taken from
light aircraft although even kites have been
used on occasions . APs are used for mapping , 
finding new sites rapidly over large areas and
illustrating and exploring known sites . 
Substantial archives of aerial photographs are
available publicly and commercially so new
pictures may not always be needed . 



Verticals and obliques
Aerial photographs used for mapping are taken
with the camera pointing straight down at the
ground ( verticals ) with the aircraft flying along
grid lines . Often these are taken from high
altitude . This is the case with the RAF archives
dating from the 1940s which are now housed at
the NMR . Overlapping vertical photographs

KEY SKILL
Comparing methods
Construct your own table for geophysics and geochemical methods to summarise and
compare strengths and weaknesses as shown below . Research and add an additional example
to each . 
Method Strengths Limitations Example
Resistivity
can be viewed through a stereoscope to see the
landscape in 3D . Their main value is in
planning and illustrating sites . Where some
dimensions in the photograph are known , 
reasonably accurate plans can be drawn of sites , 
including their contours . This is known as
photogrammetric mapping . 
Oblique photographs are the most widely used
in archaeology to locate sites and illustrate
features . These are taken from low-flying
aircraft with the picture taken at an angle to the
ground . Aerial reconaissance usually precedes
field survey . While is is fast and gives good
coverage , it can be expensive and can miss
features if their signatures are not visible from
the air . Equally , there may be features which
are invisible at ground level and this provides
the only means of recording them . There are
three main ways in which archaeological sites
show up from the air . 
Shadow sites
In low light , either at the start or end of the
day , shadows are at their longest and even quite
minor variations in ground level cast shadows , 
for instance ploughed out barrows or the
remains of early field systems . 
APs taken from a low-flying aircraft and
recorded with a camera pointed into the sun
have a distorted perspective which best picks
up shadows . The technique is best used for
20 ■ ARCHAEOLOGY COURSEBOOK
Figure 1 . 13 An excellent view of the deserted medieval village ( DMV ) of Bingham ’ s Melcombe , 
which shows up because of shadows cast by low sunlight . Traces of houses , enclosures and trackways 
are all visible
illustrating existing sites and locating details
within them , for example evidence of features
inside a hill fort . However , shadows are also
created where crops are at different heights 
( see below ) and occasionally new sites can be
detected . Winter is the best season for
photography as the sun is low and vegetation
which might mask sites has often died down . 
Snowfall and flooding can accentuate the
appearance of hollows and earthworks and
create some of the most dramatic images of
shadow sites . 
Cropmarks
The ripening and growth rate of crops is
related to the amount of moisture their root
systems can access . Plants with better access to
moisture will often grow taller and turn a
different tone or colour than those plants
around them . If there are buried archaeological
features under a field this can result in patterns
showing in the crop . A buried ditch with its
infill of humus and topsoil will often hold
moisture , creating a dark green line in the crop
above . This ‘ positive ’ cropmark is visible from
the air . The opposite occurs in plants over a
buried wall . They are likely to be stunted and
produce a yellowish ,  ‘ negative ’ cropmark .  
 ‘ Parch marks ’ show on grass for the same
reason . 
Cropmarks sometimes only show for a few
days a year . Repeatedly flying over areas over
time can pick up new and different features . 
Some only show up in drought conditions
when crops with access to moisture have the
greatest advantage and colour contrast is
exaggerated . The technique works best on
quick draining soils such as river gravels but is
less good on clay or areas of deeper topsoil , 
where the soil retains moisture well . 
Cropmarks show up best in cereal crops such
as wheat and particularly barley . They do not
show up in many crops , for example peas and
beans , and the effect of differential moisture
can be overcome or masked by irrigation or
fertiliser . Care has to be taken with interpretation , as geological features such as periglacial
cracks and modern field drainage and
underground pipelines also create cropmarks . 
Trial excavation is often the only way to firmly
identify many sites . Cropmarks are the most
prolific source of new sites , particularly for the

Soil marks
On soils where there is a marked contrast
between the colour of the topsoil and subsoil , 
evidence of ploughed-out monuments can
occur as soil marks . On chalk , the dark brown
of ditch infill will contrast with the chalk
rubble of a bank and the lighter brown of the
plough soil . 
Remote sensing
This can be a rather confusing term . Usually it
is used to distinguish between the imaging
techniques used from planes and satellites and
those of ground based prospection . Sometimes
it is used to describe all techniques that don ’ t
remove material . When you come across it , be
sure to check which sense it is being used in . 
We are using it in the first sense . The results of
all these techniques need to be checked at
ground level . 

Radar has been used to find sites both on land
and at sea . Its ability to penetrate both clouds
and dense jungle has made it particularly 
useful in Mesoamerica . At sea , side-scanning
sonar has successfully located and provided
images of objects on the seabed . Echo 
sounders or magnetometers complement it 
in wider and more localised searches 
respectively . 
A variety of airborne and satellite techniques , 
including thermal imaging and infrared
photography , are able to record temperature , 
dew and frost dispersal variations invisible to
light-sensitive film . They all work on the
principle that anomalies such as disturbed 
earth or buried walls will absorb and retain
heat or moisture at different rates to the
surrounding ground . Commercial equipment 
is really only suitable for large features
although military developments to increase
sensitivity will no doubt filter through to
archaeology . Currently such equipment is 
too expensive for most archaeological 
surveys .

To many people , archaeology simply means
excavation . Often their interest in archaeology
stems from witnessing an excavation or viewing
one on television or through other media . 
Excavation is often the public face of
archaeology . It is only when people ‘ dig ’ 
deeper into the subject that they are able to
recognise the role that excavation plays in the
wider nature of the discipline . It has its own
methodology , which constantly changes to
reflect current thinking and improving
technologies . There can never be one set of
rules for excavation although there is general
agreement on key elements of the process . This
chapter will try to reflect that current
consensus . 
WHY EXCAVATE ? 
Any removal of the accumulated evidence of
the past is a finite act . Once disturbed , 
trowelled , shovelled and bucketed away that
material cannot be replaced as it was before the
excavator removed it . Hence it has been
frequently said that ‘ all excavation is
destruction ’  . Today no one condones
excavation as it took place in the nineteenth
century : for the pleasure of the excavators and
to establish collections of artefacts . In all but
those extreme circumstances , where chance
discovery of remains demands a prompt
response , there should be controlled planning . 
This should establish the rationale for

YOUR GOALS
You need to understand
■ why and when excavation is undertaken
■ what can be achieved by excavation
■ the advantages and disadvantages of common excavation strategies
■ the principles of stratigraphy
■ how artefacts and faunal and floral material are recovered during excavations
■ the techniques of recording used in archaeology . 
excavation and formulate a series of questions , 
which it is hoped , the excavation might answer . 
Often the record of a site can be remarkably
full if a wide range of reconnaissance methods
has been applied and there are sufficient clues
about hidden features or structures . In many
cases , once the record of such survey activities
is carefully housed in an appropriate archive , 
for example the local SMR , archaeologists leave
the physical remains untouched . If , however , a
decision is made to excavate , it should be
viewed as a most serious step in the archaeological process . While most scientific
experiments can be repeated over and over
again in the laboratory , archaeological
excavation , although scientific in its approach , 
does not , by its very nature , allow a second
chance . Some excavation procedures , somewhat
confusingly referred to as sampling strategies , 
have been developed to try and ensure that not
all the evidence is removed in the primary
investigation of a feature or deposit . 
Nevertheless , in essence , excavation means
destruction . However , that ‘ destruction ’ is
minimised if the archaeologist pays appropriate
care and attention to the way the excavation is
conducted and particularly to the quality of the
records kept . This is sometimes referred to as 
 ‘ preservation by record ’  ( see p . 114 )  . 
There are other considerations . A balance must
be struck between the desire to protect archaeological remains for future generations and the
need to develop the discipline and advance our
knowledge through excavation . It is also
important that archaeology is kept sufficiently
in the public eye to receive the support it needs
in the wider political forum . 
Today , excavators are expected to : 
■ provide justifications for digging a site
■ use survey techniques to plan excavation
strategies
■ be able to cope with subsequent changes on
site
■ ensure that a complete recording system is
in place
■ select and maintain appropriate samples for
analysis
■ have facilities for all aspects of postexcavation work
■ interpret a site from a limited excavation or
sample
■ ‘ publish ’ the results of the work so that
they are available to other interested parties
■ maintain professional standards while
working under time and economic
constraints . 
If this is done then excavation can move
beyond the possible results of survey and get
to the real core of archaeology – the hard
evidence left by previous people of their
existence . 
TYPES OF EXCAVATION
Excavations today usually fall into one of three
broad categories depending on the main reason
for them : research , rescue or salvage . 
Research excavations
These are excavations on sites where there is no
immediate threat of destruction . The site is
selected by archaeologists for its suitability to
answer the questions they wish to answer . It
can be excavated according to archaeological
needs rather than prompted by the threat of
development . Research excavation is only
undertaken when the perceived benefits to

KEY SITE
Avebury
Recent research has revealed much new detail of this famous archaeological landscape . The
eastern lines of stones running to Avebury from the Sanctuary , known as the West Kennet
Avenue , are well known but the possible avenue to the west , the Beckhampton Avenue , has been
surrounded in mystery . William Stukeley recorded it in the eighteenth century but only two
visible stones survive . Investigation of this key element of the world heritage site of Avebury
began with investigation of a cropmark of what appeared to be an oval enclosure lying
adjacent to the suspected line of the avenue . 
Fieldwork and excavation to evaluate the evidence involved three universities assisted by
English Heritage ( EH ) and the Ancient Monuments Laboratory ( AML )  . The enclosure proved
to have features similar to causewayed enclosures of the early Neolithic . Geophysics surveys on
the line of the avenue revealed three pits left where stones had been removed and broken up
and three still containing buried sarsen stones . These had been deliberately tipped over to
remove surface trace of them . 
This research answered some questions on the enclosure and the stones of the Avenue but
posed others . Further research is planned .

KEY SITE
Castell Henllys
This small Iron Age hill fort in South West Wales was bought in 1980 by the co-founder of the
London Dungeon , who worked to develop it as a tourist attraction with reconstructed Iron Age
houses . Subsequently it has been taken over by the Pembrokeshire Coast National Park , which
has established a visitors ’ centre on the site . 
It was necessary to excavate the site and recover the evidence on which to base the
reconstructions . Students and paying volunteers have helped in the excavations each summer . 
Over twenty seasons , archaeologists have studied the defensive circuit , the complex phases of
the gateway , and almost the whole of the interior of the fort . Reconstructions of four major
roundhouses and smaller constructions have been completed .

archaeological understanding outweigh the loss
of the original site , or part of it , to future
generations . 
There is little public or commercial funding of
research excavation so archaeologists have to
finance themselves by alternative means . For
instance , universities that run ‘ training
excavations ’ for their undergraduates may also
accept paying ‘ volunteers ’  . Applied research
agencies , for example the British Academy , 
provide some support for this type of longterm research . 
Rescue excavations
The term ‘ rescue excavations ’ was coined in the
1960s when so much development was in
progress that the earlier pattern of amateur and
university summer excavations could no long
cope with the volume of archaeological sites
being threatened and destroyed . Rescue , a
charitable trust , dramatised the threat to
Britain ’ s archaeology by using as its logo an
image of Stonehenge being scooped up in a
bulldozer ’ s bucket . However , this conjures up a
rather more violent image than is truly the
picture . In fact what was recognised was that
the scale and pace of development meant that
much valuable evidence was in danger of being
lost if it could not be excavated and recorded . 
Excavation teams were needed all year round . 
http /  / www . rescue-archaeology . 
freeserve . co . uk / 
Some teams were centrally based within
government agencies while others were formed
locally to combat specific threats . The M5
Rescue Committee is a good example of a
group founded with a clear but essentially
time-constrained focus . From these late
1960s / early 1970s teams most of today ’ s
archaeological units have developed . Many
have urban bases , but demand for large urban
excavation has fallen considerably since the
introduction of PPG 16 ( see p . 111 )  . 
Originally , rescue teams identified potential
threats to archaeological sites from planned
developments such as road building , gravel
extraction or pipelines , and submitted bids for
public funding to excavate before development
began . Today planning authorities , guided by
PPG 16 , often require developers to prepare
impact assessments and may also demand a
formal site evaluation . Depending on the
findings there may be excavation in advance of
development and / or a watching brief during
construction . On the principle of ‘ the polluter
pays ’ the cost is increasingly passed on to
developers . However , for most sites , full
excavation with its heavy costs and delays in
construction is not usually necessary . Where
excavation does occur , decisions are made on
whether all of a site should be excavated or just
a sample . Often work will be concentrated on
areas felt to be of greatest importance . 
Excavation takes place within a time limit but
is carefully planned and involves co-operation
between archaeologists , planners and
contractors . Archaeologists can usually carry
out their work according to correct archaeological procedures . Rescue does not generally
mean working under the jaws of mechanical
diggers in an uncontrolled rush . If it is , this
will usually be in the final days of what has
previously been an ordered excavation . Nonarchaeologists often find the pace of excavation
slower than they would imagine and need to
have the processes explained to them . The
Channel Tunnel Project provides an excellent
example of a considered strategy for retrieving
archaeological evidence .

KEY SITE
Empingham , Rutland , Part 1
The valley of the river Gwash was of little interest to people outside Rutland until planners in
the 1970s decided to build a dam across it . The area flooded would create Rutland Water –
one of England ’ s largest lakes . 
Through the chance discovery of an AngloSaxon brooch and the process of fieldwalking
two Romano-British sites were revealed which
enabled archaeologists to plan rescue
excavations on an Anglo-Saxon cemetery , a
Romano-British farmstead and a villa
respectively . All three sites lay directly under
the line of the proposed dam . 
Excavations over three seasons were designed
and conducted with knowledge of the
impending engineering development but with
the normal safeguards of time for the removal
and recording of features and finds . However , 
once the contractors arrived on site the
nature of the archaeological work changed
considerably .  .  .  see p . 32 .

buckle . Preserved wood remains in the spear socket were identified as willow and poplar and in the
bucket as yew . See drawing of finds in Figure 11 . 10 ( p . 253 ) 
Salvage excavations
There are some occasions when archaeological
evidence is unexpectedly revealed in circumstances where it is impossible for excavation to
be pre-planned or systematic . The main
decision is whether in the circumstances
excavating will be a valid exercise or whether
simply to note the presence of the remains is
the better option . A rapid exploration is often
the best that can be hoped for . 
There is some overlap between these categories
as the Empingham example shows . It is also the
case that priorities in rescue excavations can be
set to answer research questions . The bulk of
excavation in Britain today is rescue work .

KEY SITE
The Channel Tunnel rail link
The development of this new railway
resulted in the largest archaeological
project to date in the United Kingdom . 
Engineers and archaeologists worked in
tandem to ensure that archaeological
issues were fully considered throughout the
process . Rail Link Engineering employed
its own archaeologists and others involved
have come from English Heritage , 
University College London , Kent County
Council and four other units . 
All forms of survey work were carried out ; 
over 2 , 000 trial trenches and test pits
were dug . Fieldwork informed the setting
of priorities about where to excavate . 
Some 55 hectares of the route were
identified as requiring detailed archaeological investigation . Planning of the work
gave archaeologists time to ‘ painstakingly ’ 
record the archaeological deposits on the
sites selected for detailed work . Other
areas were subject to watching briefs 
( where archaeologists are on hand to
observe work – particularly topsoil removal
– so they can recognise and record
features as they appear )  . In this particular
scheme the archaeologists were empowered
to stop construction work if ‘ features of
significance ’ were identified . Over forty
sites have been excavated with dates
ranging from the Palaeolithic to the
Second World War . The impact of the new
evidence will enhance and probably alter
many current perceptions of Kent ’ s
archaeology .

Empingham , Rutland , Part 2
A watching brief was negotiated with the developers and a series of discoveries were made as
mechanical scrapers systematically stripped the landscape of its topsoil on both sides of the
river for 2 kilometres back from the dam . These included : 
■ two burials in stone coffins
■ a third major Romano-British site
■ an Iron Age roundhouse
■ two Anglo-Saxon grubenhauser
■ a sunken Iron Age trackway
■ a large Anglo-Saxon inhumation cemetery
with 130 burials . 
An excavation team and resources had to be
gathered at short notice to deal with the
situation . The Romano-British site and burials
had to be excavated immediately as they lay in
the path of planned engineering works , which
could not be delayed . Arrangements were made
for contractors to ‘ work around ’ the other sites
which enabled a higher level of excavation and
recording .

EXCAVATION STRATEGIES AND THE
PROCESS OF EXCAVATION
The previous section identified reasons for
excavations . In all cases there is a degree of
choice available to archaeologists . 
Archaeologists are aware of the nature of their
sites and do not dig ‘ blind ’  . While there is
always the element of unpredictability , which is
one of the joys of the subject , a qualified
excavation director should be able to work out
an appropriate strategy using prior knowledge
and fieldwork results . 
Defining the site in question is the first issue 
( see p . 166 )  . In excavation terms some ‘ sites ’ 
are in fact a series of smaller ‘ sites ’ in
themselves . For example , cropmarks may
indicate a series of features ( enclosures , pits , 
tracks ) which can be separated out for investigation while a Roman town has a street plan
and a variety of public and private buildings
each capable of individual excavation . Sites are
set within a landscape context and a successful
excavation needs to take note of that factor too . 
So those planning to excavate need to
determine whether it is the entirety of the site

chance to answer the questions posed for the
excavation . 


hhindwell . htm
There is no set manual for archaeological field
practices either in relation to where to put the
holes in the ground or in how to proceed once
the excavation trench is underway . This is not
because archaeologists have a laissez-faire
attitude to standards and procedures but
because of variety in the nature of sites , 
evidence and questions asked . Most texts on
excavation express their ideas about appropriate 
 ‘ good practice ’ and as new methods evolve so
they too appear in print . The archaeological
world constantly shares its experiences and a
general consensus of current good practice is
evident when one looks at images of modern
excavations . Practitioners learn from one
another and try to keep their methods in line
with current thinking and therefore ensure that
their results , when published , stand up to
scrutiny and are accepted by their peers . For
example , many archaeological units use the
Museum of London manual . 

The nature of the archaeological record in the
ground is often complex . Human nature and
life circumstances ensure that most sites have a
developmental history , which the archaeologist
needs to unravel . The people who left the
evidence went about their daily business
without a thought for how their activities
might leave traces for future investigators . 
They were not simply creating ‘ features ’ much
of the time , nor did they often build a structure
and leave it unaltered . However , their
constructional or daily activities will have
created a sequence of deposits , layers or
contexts ( the words are often used interchangeably ) which builds up to create the
archaeological record . Contained within these
deposits , which are linked to features and

structures , are the artefacts of pottery , 
metalwork , etc . and ecofacts , which provide
sources for understanding the chronological , 
cultural and environmental nature of the site . 
One further issue which excavators have to be
aware of is the health and safety of their
diggers . Precautions range from hardhats and
reflective clothing on developer sites to
ensuring that deep trenches are properly shored
up or have stepped sides . Safety issues are most
evident on underwater sites where air supply , 
currents , cold and sharks are amongst the
potential hazards not faced on land . 
How to dig ? 
The crux of the excavation methodology debate
centres on the fact that all sites have two
distinct but interrelated horizons . A vertical
sequence of layers containing structures and
finds , and the horizontal layout of an
occupation area or individual structure . To
record both sets of evidence is vital . Over the
years methods have evolved to attempt to solve
this difficult balancing trick . Unless the archaeologist can establish the correct succession of
levels ( see p . 39 ) an excavation and its results
will have limited , if any , value . Likewise the
inability to produce the plan ( layout ) of a
building or a cemetery leaves the researcher
well short of the required results . 
Archaeologists have therefore developed a
series of methods appropriate to different types
of site . The methods chosen reflect the need to
achieve a full record of a site within the limits
of the resources available for the excavation . 
Trenches
The term ‘ trench ’ has been applied to any
linear excavation and sometimes to any hole
cut into the ground by archaeologists , whatever
its surface shape . A stricter definition is a
rectangular shaped excavation of variable width
and length . Frequently the length far exceeds
the width as trenches are used to investigate
linear archaeological features such as defensive
earthworks by being placed at 90° to the
alignment of the feature . The trenches cut by
Alcock through the defences of South Cadbury
hill fort in Somerset provide a classic example . 
By strategically placing a series of 2-metre wide
trenches around the hill he was able to study
and report on the developmental sequence of
the site ’ s fortifications . This had the added
bonus of disturbing a small proportion of the
site in return for a volume of evidence . Most of
the site was left undamaged for future archaeologists . Other linear features such as roads and
boundaries can be cross-sectioned in this way . 
Offa ’ s Dyke , an early medieval feature running
from north to south Wales , has been the focus
of a long-term study by Manchester University
and over 100 trenches have been put across it
to check and confirm details of its construction . Cutting across linear features on a smaller
scale frequently occurs on area excavations . At

profiles . 
Those of you who have watched Time Team on
Channel 4 will be familiar with the use of trial
trenches to investigate possible features
identified through archaeological reconnaissance . In many countries test pits , usually 
1 metre square , from the surface down to
bedrock , perform a similar function . They also
provide an insight into the stratigraphy of the
site . Trial trenches and test pits are regularly
used in developer led archaeology to determine
whether excavation will be needed or whether
remains can be left ‘ in situ ’  . They are less
photogenic than open area excavations and less
regularly seen in popular archaeological
magazines . 
Area excavation
This is the most common form of excavation as
can be seen with reference to reports or
archaeological magazines .  ‘ Area ’ or ‘ openstripping ’ occurs where the extent of the
features to be uncovered determines the size of
the excavation . This does not mean that whole
sites are always laid bare . This can be an
outcome but more frequently other factors
limit the total recovery of evidence . Financial
constraints may limit the amount of digging
36 ■ ARCHAEOLOGY COURSEBOOK
Figure 2 . 9 An area excavation of the Anglo-Saxon site at West Heslerton showing that extensive
features are preserved just below the surface of the ground . Attempting to interpret these features
without excavation could be very misleading
while other logistical constraints could lead to a
seasonal approach where parts of a site are
uncovered and researched year by year . 
Danebury hill fort is a well-published example
of such a strategy . In development areas only
part of the site may be threatened or available
for excavation . The depth of the archaeological
deposits is important . You can excavate a
greater area of a site with shallow remains than
one with deeper stratification ( for example
urban sites ) in the same time and with similar
resource implications . Finally there are archaeological considerations . Only a sample of the
site may be needed to address a question . It is
impossible to generalise on the size of an area
excavation . It is as large or as small as the
demands of the archaeology dictate in the eyes
of the site director . 
Although destructive , area excavation has
become the key approved method for several
reasons . 
■ Complete structures can be studied . 
■ Complex relationships between features can
be clarified . 
■ It provides excellent recording possibilities . 
■ A total understanding of horizontal
relationships is possible . 
When area excavation became fashionable there
was criticism from those traditionalists who
had used trenches . The sides of trenches have
the advantage of revealing the vertical sequence
of deposits ( stratigraphy ) and there was
concern that this essential record might be lost . 
The depth of deposits can vary and the issue is
of great significance where the stratification is
deeper and more complicated . This problem
can be addressed by leaving baulks ( undug
strips of ground ) at strategic points or , 
increasingly , by carefully recording the
horizontal picture of a site layer by layer and
feeding the data into a computer . This can be
interrogated to produce sections along any
chosen line . The problem is that without
baulks no check is left in place if the director
wishes to refer back , so the recording systems
must be of the highest quality . 
Box-grid or quadrant systems
These sit in an intermediate position between
trenches and area excavation attempting to
offer archaeologists the better aspects of each
by giving access to both the horizontal view
and the vertical cut simultaneously . 
The box-grid system owes its origins to the
work of Sir Mortimer Wheeler in the first half
of the twentieth century . He would set out a
grid of square ‘ boxes ’ to be excavated with
baulks left in between them . This resulted in a
dig resembling a patchwork quilt . An
advantage was the chance to record four
sections for every ‘ box ’  . Removal of spoil was
also easier as baulks provided barrow runs . 
However , the whole layout of a site was not
revealed until the baulks were finally removed . 
Important relationships between features or
structures would not be understood while
digging , which might depend on such an
understanding , was progressing . The system
was costly of time and manpower and its
popularity short-lived though it is still possible
to see some excavations where a pattern of trial
trenching that clearly owes something to this
earlier method is used . 
The ‘ quadrant system ’ is a similar approach
that is still in common usage . It is particularly
relevant in the case of sites that are approximately circular in nature , such as round
barrows , although a smaller scale version of
this method is often employed on hearths , pits
or even postholes . The feature is cut into four
quarters by lines intersecting at the middle and

opposing quadrants are excavated first . It is
possible after only removing half the remains
to see patterns of features in plan ( which if
they show common elements suggest that they
continue under the undug areas ) and to totally
record the vertical profile of the site in two
directions . 
THE PROCESS OF EXCAVATION
Archaeologists have developed a variety of
methods for removing archaeological deposits 
from the ground in which they have lain to suit
the varying circumstances of archaeological
sites . The topsoil is removed by mechanically
topstripping with a digger or by using picks , 
mattocks and shovels . This is either bulldozed
or wheelbarrowed away to start a spoil heap . 
This has to be far enough away to avoid it

KEY TASK
Simulating quadrant excavation
Students with a sweet tooth might like to
enhance their understanding of excavation
procedures by attempting a quadrant
excavation of a gateau placed on a
patterned plate . You should reveal enough
of the plate to recognise patterns and see
clearly the layers of sponge and cream in
the excavated sections ! 
KEY TASK
Testing the law of superposition
When you have been working at your desk
for a while or after , say , half an hour of a
lesson look at the way your books , papers , 
pencil case , sweet wrappers ( or those of
your fellow students ) have combined in an
overlapping manner . If you pick your way
backwards through the evidence it should
be possible to establish in reverse order
the sequence of events that led to the
accumulated material being in position . 
This will not tell you when the movement
of items took place but should establish
the order . The floor of your room provides
an alternative site to examine .

KEY CONCEPT
Stratigraphy
In any text about archaeological sites you will
come across terms such as level , layer , 
deposit , stratum . They describe the make-up
of the excavated ground in terms of layers . 
These were created either by people or
nature . Archaeologists attempt to carefully
record these strata – the stratification . By
studying their relationship they can build up a
sequence of events on the site . The study of
the strata is known as stratigraphy . 
Each layer , usually identified from those above
and below it during excavation by colour , 
texture or content has its own spatial
boundaries and relationships . Archaeologists
talk and write about these relationships . If no
intrusive features are present ( for example a
pit dug from an upper / recent layer down
through lower / older layers ) it would be safe
to assume that layers at the bottom of any
sequence are older than those at the top . 
Each successive layer was deposited after the
one directly below it . This is sometimes
refered to as ‘ the law of superposition ’  . But
life and archaeological sites are not usually
that simple . Archaeologists need to establish
which layers overlie others and which cut into
earlier layers or are cut by later ones . Only by
posing and answering such questions then planning each layer and relating it into a vertical
sequence can a picture emerge of change and development on a site . 
It is within the layers that the artefactual , environmental and dating evidence is located . They
are like a time capsule . Materials in any layer are likely to be broadly contemporary and can
be dated by association with dateable evidence from that layer . The layer holds the clues to the
immediate context of finds and structures . Plotting the position of each layer within the site
helps determine chronological patterns . Other archaeologists will use published data about the
stratification to assure themselves of the authenticity of the conclusions reached about phasing
on a site . 
Figure 2 . 12 A picture that demonstrates
how the law of superposition can tell a
story . The female skeleton is lying above the
mosaic at Kingscote and covered by building
debris . The interpretation is that she was
one of a number of ‘ squatters ’ who occupied
the derelict villa building but was killed , 
apparently trying to escape , when it
collapsed
spilling over and contaminating deeper layers
or burying the diggers . Although mechanical
diggers are used for trial trenches , most
excavation is by hand . According to the time
available and the nature of the deposits , tools
could range from shovels to dentistry
instruments for recovering tiny fragments of
material . The most familiar toolkit includes a
mattock , a short pointed trowel , a dustbrush , a
coalshovel and a bucket . Eventually , and very
neatly , what was an archaeological resource will
have been converted into a hole in the ground . 
The extracted evidence must be subjected to a
rigorous recording process or the excavation
will have destroyed the site and its potential . 
Recording requirements will vary for sites with
less obvious collectable material or with
particular distributions of evidence . 
Layers of deposits in the ground are
recognised , labelled and removed in sequence . 
On many sites such as Roman or medieval
where pottery sherds and animal bones are
common , their collection is linked to the
contexts in which the material is found . They
are collected in labelled ‘ finds trays ’ so that all
the finds from each layer can be put together . 
They will subsequently be washed , dried and
coded to their particular layer for recording . 
On the same sites less common objects like
metal , worked bone or stone will usually be
classified as ‘ small finds ’ and a distinct and
more comprehensive recording system will
ensure that the precise location of each find is
recorded in three dimensions by triangulation
and depth measurements . They are collected in
finds trays or plastic bags and given unique
reference numbers . On a working floor
associated with a prehistoric flint-knapper
careful plotting of each flake is necessary to
recreate the sequence of the earlier activity . 
Sometimes their position in a layer is marked
by a small flag so that distribution patterns can
be recorded . These finds will be kept separately
and the nature and fragility of each object will
determine their post-excavation scientific
treatment . 
40 ■ ARCHAEOLOGY COURSEBOOK
KEY CONCEPT cont . 
The key methods of publishing information about a site ’ s stratigraphy have long been via the
medium of section drawings ( see p . 48 )  . While this is still quite prevalent , the Harris Matrix 
( invented in 1973 ) has revolutionised the representation of the sequence of deposits by using
schematic diagrams . This recording system , which can apply equally to standing buildings or
rock art as to more traditional archaeological deposits , has been widely adopted . The Harris
Matrix website outlines its significance and provides a range of links . One key observation
made by Harris and previously not fully developed is the idea that boundaries between
elements of a section may be as significant as the layers themselves . His term for these
boundaries is ‘ interfaces ’ and in the schematic drawings these can be represented as ‘ units of
stratification ’  . 

Recovery of environmental material
Not all the material to be retrieved can be
recovered by trowelling . The ground contains
much smaller and less obvious evidence , in
particular faunal ( animal ) and floral ( plant ) 
evidence such as snail shells , small fish or bird
bones , insect remains , seeds and pollen grains . 
Not all of these are visible to the naked eye . 
Tiny fragments of metal or worked material
such as flint or glass present the same problem .

Klithi has been

to recording
This material can be recovered on-site by using
sieving or flotation or by taking strategically
selected soil samples for later analysis . 
Buckets of spoil from the excavation , or a
sample , are tipped into a basic garden sieve and
riddled over a barrow to ensure that finds not
detected in the digging process are retrieved . 
A series of sieves with increasingly finer mesh
improve collection chances and also collect
different sized material in each sieve . The
introduction of water to create ‘ wet-sieving ’  , 
whether by spray or dipping into a tank , helps
to remove the soil particles . Wet material is
often easier to identify and locate by colour
contrast . 
Soil sampling
Some recovery of environmental remains
occurs off-site following the collection of soil
samples . These are taken from selected
locations such as pits , ditches or other similar
diagnostic features or layers . On peat sites , 
long sampling tins are hammered vertically into
the sides of freshly dug sections , removed and
quickly sealed in plastic to avoid contamination . They are then placed in cold storage
before detailed analysis in the laboratory . 
The pollens and plant remains in them will be
used to provide vegetation sequences and help
date the site . Soil may also be sampled for
chemical analysis , particularly for phosphates 
( see p . 15 )  . 
Flotation
This involves putting soil samples into water . 
Lighter materials such as plant remains float to
the surface while the soil drops to the bottom
of the container . Improvements to this basic
methodology include adding oil to hold tiny
particles on the surface and bubbling air from
below the water to create a froth , which holds
and separates lighter organic material . Water is

Metal detection
On some excavations , and directly under the
control of the director , it is appropriate to use
metal detectors . They can be employed as part
of the initial survey as a piece of geophysical
equipment but they can also be used to check
the spoil dump for finds . This would be
applicable if the site had been stripped by
machine rather than by hand or if soil removal
had been by pick and shovel without
subsequent sieving . Any such finds would be
classed as unstratified . Metal detectors can also
be used to alert diggers to potentially fragile
metal objects in areas they are trowelling . 
In whatever way the finds are identified and
collected it is vital that the methods used allow
their full potential to be exploited in postexcavation analysis and dating procedures . 
Individual directors of excavations have to
make valid decisions about the processes they
adopt in order to balance the needs of the dig
to make sufficient progress with the demands
of post-excavation studies . 
WHAT RECORDS DO ARCHAEOLOGISTS
CREATE ? 
Different directors will approach the task of
recording , as they will the excavation itself , 
from slightly different standpoints . But certain
common themes will feature : context sheets , 
plans , sections , photographs , artefact collection
systems and , increasingly , the use of on-site
computer technology . They also make use of a
range of surveying equipment to plot the exact

Figure 2 . 20 Plan of an excavated round barrow at Lockington using the quadrant method of mound
removal . Circular features such as the surrounding ring ditch and palisade gully are revealed in each
quadrant . Eight narrow baulks are left for extra sections . A pit containing gold armlets was located on
the edge of the barrow . Although clearly important , no relationship could be established by the processes
of excavation to link this pit and its contents to the barrow and the cremation burial below it
individual features . For example , an excavation
of an Anglo-Saxon cemetery requires an overall
plan to show the relationships between graves
and associated features . A detailed plan
drawing will be required of each individual
grave to show the position of skeletal remains
and the location of grave goods . The position
of some of the artefacts may be better
explained by a close-up drawing featuring , 
perhaps , the chest area of the burial . 

All these drawings relate to the fixed recording
grid on the site . Their position is plotted using
surveying equipment and their dimensions
carefully scaled onto paper . This usually
involves placing a gridframe over the feature to
assist the production of accurately measured
drawings . Considerable effort after the
excavation often goes into producing cleaned
up versions of these plans for publication . 
Often finds and features will be plotted on a
series of overlays related to soil and
topography . Increasingly , plans are plotted onto
computers because of the flexibility in
presenting data they allow . GIS is revolutionising this process . Its 3D database enables
the production of any section or plan and the
testing of complex models .

Section drawings
The sides of excavation trenches , strategically
placed baulks or cuts through the fill of
features such as ditches , pits or postholes offer
vertical slices through the constituent layers of
an archaeological site . 
Although methods of recording the horizontal
spread and depth of each deposit have
improved over recent decades it still remains
true that an accurate scaled depiction of the
vertical relationship of layers is commonly used
to demonstrate the development of a site or
feature . For example , the relationship of a ‘ post
pipe ’ – the evidence for the location of the post
itself – within a posthole and to any packing
material is best related in drawn form . As with
plans , a key advantage of section drawings is
that they can highlight subtle differences in the
colour , texture or composition of layers . These
are difficult to pick up with photographs . 
Before drawing it is essential that the face of
the section is cleaned up and in some instances
sprayed with water to improve contrast . 
Munsell colour charts are sometimes used to
enable specific and standardised descriptions . 
Where a section results from a continuous
period of excavation it may be some time
before it is ready for recording . Archaeologists
note the presence of layers as the dig proceeds
by pinning labels to the side of the excavation
with context numbers to ensure that when the
section is drawn it is still possible to recognise
the finer points of the stratification . Such labels
are frequently seen on site photographs . 
Once completed , drawings are usually
accompanied by an interpretation offered in
textual or schematic form such as the Harris
Matrix ( see p . 40 )  . It must be stressed that
drawings are always interpretations and the
quality of on-site drawings does vary according
to the skill of the recorder and the conditions
they are working under . Back-up photographs
can provide an additional record . 
Photographs
The camera is a key aid to recording although
many archaeologists observe that it is less
comprehensive in the detail it can show than
the drawn record . Although rulers or ranging
rods are usually seen in photographs to give an
idea of scale , distances are distorted and film
cannot be used to provide precise

measurements . The camera clearly offers the
chance of accurate views of features and
sections whereas the draughtsperson can
accentuate elements that the camera might
obscure , for example similar coloured soils
which have different textures . The camera also
provides back up in case the drawings are poor . 
The two methods complement each other and
both are normally used . 
The essence of site photography lies in
ensuring that the parts to be captured on film
are clean , edges of individual structures or
bones are well established , a scale is in shot , 
and careful spraying is used to accentuate
coloration changes and contrasts . It may be
appropriate to have some site / feature reference
codes included in the photograph . The use of
photographic towers or other means to get a
camera above the excavation is common . 
Vertical photographs with scales can be used as
an aid in the creation of plans . 
Developments in digital photography are being
incorporated into archaeological recording
systems . Many archaeologists continue to use
black and white prints for contrast while
colour slides help form the basis of lectures . 
Increasingly , directors employ video as a
support to the site diary , thus capturing details
of features and colours . Digital cameras and
videos enable the excavation experience to be
shared online .

SPECIAL CASES
Most of the points in this chapter apply to all
sites but there are other issues that apply to
particular types of sites . 
Recording standing buildings
Although the usual rules of stratigraphy may
not entirely apply , one of the objectives of
recording is to enable the developmental
sequence of the building to be traced . Details
of the fabric and construction of the building , 
alterations and dating evidence are gathered
through drawing and photography . Buildings
are often drawn stone by stone using grids as
the completed drawing can often reveal
patterns not obvious to the naked eye . This can
be supplemented by photogrammetry . EDMs
have made the task of measuring buildings
much swifter while computer-aided design 
( CAD ) enables 3D presentations of the results . 
Archaeology of standing buildings
In ‘ traditional ’ archaeology interpretation of
excavated evidence relies on the basic principle
that the deeper the deposit , the earlier it is –
the basis of relative dating by stratigraphy . 
Although standing buildings require a different
approach to their study , the basic principles
remain the same . Where a feature has been
inserted into an existing one ( for example a
window or door inserted into a standing wall ) 
it follows that the inserted feature is later than
that into which it was inserted . Similarly , later
walls may be of different construction to the
original or may be butt-jointed ( simply butted
up against earlier walls rather than properly
bonded )  . All of these clues help archaeologists
to build up a sequence of development in the
same way as on an excavation . Recording
standing buildings may involve reconnaissance

The archaeologists have
identified features of the
building by date to
enable the sequence of
construction and
alteration to be
interpreted
techniques ( see p . 10 )  , dismantling , excavation
or a combination of these approaches . The
amount of information which may be
recovered from a building will depend on many
factors . Cosmetic renovation of a structure may
give only a few clues ( for example glimpses
beneath floor boards or behind small areas of
plaster ) whereas a building undergoing
substantial alterations or even demolition will
be far more exposed to study . The aim should
be to identify the earliest structural remains on
the site and then , having plotted them , begin 
to add in later stages of development . 
Additions or changes to a building are never
random : they will always serve a clear purpose
which archaeologists try to detect , for example
the extending of a room or rebuilding of a
façade . 
The recording of standing buildings should be
every bit as rigorous as the recording of an
excavation . Alongside drawings and written
descriptions a full photographic record should
be maintained , indicating scale and the exact
point on a master plan from which the view
was taken , along with any other relevant
information . Sampling should include examples
of different mortars and plasters . Substantial
timbers may be sampled for
dendrochronology . 
Wetland archaeology
Waterlogged sites are where the natural water
table has maintained a wet or damp
environment since the deposition of the
evidence . They have been a major factor in
adding to our knowledge of past cultures . 
Anaerobic conditions , which prevent or
impede normal bacterial and chemical decay
processes , can result in widespread survival of
organic material such as wood , leather and
textiles which would normally perish . Strategies
for excavation , conservation and postexcavation analysis on wetland sites need to
take into account the time and cost of dealing
with additional evidence as well as the
particular problems associated with
waterlogged sites . In particular there are often
large quantities of environmental material , 
especially plant remains . While the complete
removal of all material for close examination is
not usually a viable proposition much emphasis
is put on the selection of large numbers of
samples of site deposits for laboratory analysis . 
Once out of water , organic material will be
stored in tanks of water prior to conservation

EXCAVATION ■ 51
Figure 2 . 28 Salvage excavation at a wetland
site . Three Iron Age boats were unexpectedly
uncovered at Holme Pierrepoint . The
archaeologists had to rapidly excavate them
before decay or mechanical diggers destroyed
them
by , for example , treatment with polyethyleneglycol ( PEG ) or freeze-drying to prevent
rapid decay . 
The consequence is that while the information
from ‘ wet ’ sites is considered a real bonus in
archaeological study , the costs of obtaining it
considerably outstrip those of excavating ‘ dry ’ 
sites . 
Unlike ‘ dry ’ sites where you can walk carefully
across the site , pressure on wetland deposits
can cause considerable damage . Excavators at
Flag Fen erected a series of platforms on
scaffolding to allow diggers to lie above the
features they were excavating . Such restriction
to movement makes digging , cleaning , planning
and photography all the more difficult . 

Underwater archaeology
Although underwater sites follow the same
basic rules as dry sites – the need for survey , 
careful excavation and recording – being below
water presents additional challenges . The
excavators usually require watertight diving
suits , air tanks and weights . In extreme depths
remotely controlled vehicles may be used . In
addition to underwater hazards , cold temperatures may make it difficult to remain
stationary for long periods while poor visibility
may require excavation using touch rather than
sight ! 
To inform excavation strategy a form of
sampling is often employed to gain a feel for
the site . One example of this is the Tudor
warship the Mary Rose whose position and
condition was examined and investigated for
several years before a full enough
understanding was derived to lead to full
excavation . Where little or no wooden remains
are present and finds are in a dispersed state , 
plans are drawn and trial trenches excavated to
determine the extent of the deposits .

Removal of spoil can employ a combination 
of hand movement and water dispersal but
special tools are usually required . A water 
lance can shred sediment while a range of 
water vacuum cleaners can help excavate 
spoil and keep a site clear of sediment for
recording . Objects may have suffered 
corrosion and created concretions that need 
to be broken apart . Decisions have to be 
made as to whether to use hammer and chisel
below water or to bring the whole mass to 
the surface . Ordinary finds are placed in open
containers , fragile finds in sealed ones and
larger objects lifted by the use of inflated air
bags . As with waterlogged sites , organic
material is susceptible to damage if it is
allowed , even briefly , to dry out during
excavation . Once such material is removed
from the water it must be quickly put into
appropriate storage . 
Plastic 2 × 2 or 4 × 4 metre recording grids are
set out and the usual land-based methods of
planning , context sheets and photography
employed where possible . Synthetic paper
enables ordinary pens to be used underwater . 
Photography is likely to be limited to close-up
shots or carefully rigged photogrammetry rather
52 ■ ARCHAEOLOGY COURSEBOOK
than general views . One advantage of underwater excavation is that the archaeologist can
cross the site without treading on a trowelled
surface ! 
Urban archaeology
While it is clear that there is a great variety in
the nature of archaeological sites in rural areas , 
archaeologists working on urban sites face very
different challenges . 
In urban areas open ground is at a premium
and so it is usually the clearance of a site for
development that provides archaeological
opportunities . The area involved is often tightly
constrained by other buildings and therefore
only parts of buried sites are available for

study . These do not necessarily correspond to
areas which archaeologists would choose if
they were making the site selection on
academic grounds , a good example of rescue
archaeology being dictated by developer
activity . Such excavations are like keyholes into
the past because a full view cannot be obtained . 
The depth of stratification is usually much
greater than on rural sites because of frequent
reuse of the same site over time . It is particularly difficult to forecast the range of features , 
that will be encountered and the time it will
take to excavate them all properly . Deep
excavation also presents additional safety
hazards . 
Survey methods applicable to rural sites such as
aerial photography and many of the
geophysical procedures are ineffectual or
inappropriate in preparatory work . Indeed , at a
large excavation in London at Number 1 , 
Poultry in the 1990s the evaluation consisted 
of a desktop survey and four shafts between
3 m and 5 m deep to reach the top of the
natural geology . These gave indications of the
sequences and structures which might be
encountered . The excavation also produced 
 ‘ wet ’ archaeology including about 1 , 500 datable 
( by dendrochronology ) Roman timbers . This
extensive urban excavation ( the on-site budget
exceeded £2m ) continued for twelve months
under the construction of the new building . 
Normally archaeologists have to complete their
work before the building contractors arrive on
site . 
54 ■ ARCHAEOLOGY COURSEBOOK
KEY TASK
Comparative study of survey and
excavation methods
Take either an excavation report or an
article from Current Archaeology , British
Archaeology or Rescue News . Make notes
under the following headings : 
■ Name of site
■ Reason for excavation
■ Was this a research , rescue or salvage
excavation ? 
■ Source of funding
■ Prior knowledge of site and survey
methods employed prior to excavation
■ Style and strategy of excavation
■ Key finds
■ Post-excavation scientific activity
■ Dating methods employed
If a group of students follow this
information gathering process , valuable
comparative data will emerge to inform
discussion on a series of key issues relating
to current practice in archaeology . 
Figure 2 . 30 The excavation of human remains
increasingly raises ethical questions for
archaeologists . What ethical issues do you think
are raised by the excavation and disposal of
human remains from sites such as Spitalfields ?

KEY SKILL
Tackling structured , source-based questions
These questions are found at GCSE , AS and some A Level papers . You may also have to
analyse sites in a similar way at university . At GCSE you will have one source per set of
questions , at AS and beyond you will usually have several sources to work with at the same
time . These will be drawn from archaeological plans , sections , illustrations , tables , maps , 
photographs and reports . Four common areas are outlined below . Two essential pieces of
equipment which you can take into the exam are a ruler and a magnifying glass . Be sure to
use them . 
Interpreting plans
Begin with an accurate description of the relevant sites , features and artefacts in order to build
up a picture of overall function or changes . You should consider : 
■ size
■ orientation
■ spatial distribution of features
■ phases of use : discuss any stratigraphic evidence for different periods of activity
■ assess individual features to identify site function
■ boundaries : are they defensive or just a demarcation line – a physical or a spiritual barrier
or both ? 
When you discuss these , refer to context numbers where they are given . 
Interpreting aerial photographs
Read all the questions concerned with these first . They will probably ask about method as well
as interpretation and you need to match the right response to a question . For interpretation
start by describing what you can see . Is it a cropmark , soil mark or shadows ? What size and
shape is it ? Is it a boundary , structure or some other type of feature . How is it aligned ? 
Only when you have done this , suggest specific site or period . This way you will get some marks
even where you get it wrong . Questions about the method will usually require an account of
why features are visible and can be recorded and why they do not show up in all areas 
( see pp . 20–3 )  . 
Appraising methods
You need to understand the basic techniques for each type of material you are likely to be
tested on , for example stone , pottery , metal , and what it can tell us . Ensure you know the main
principles and some of their strengths and limitations . In the case of dating and reconnaissance
methods it is sensible to test yourself on their application to different types of material and
sites . In all cases , one good example is useful .

AFTER EXCAVATION
Once the digging is completed attention
switches to the laboratories and the processing
of finds and site records . This is dealt with in
Chapters 3 and 4 . The eventual outcome of the
excavation used to be a full excavation report
with text on the features and structures , 
catalogues and drawings of finds and
specialists ’ reports . Today the emphasis is on
producing a quality ‘ archive ’ which can then be
adapted as appropriate into reports , more
popular publications or to provide research
opportunities . Increasingly records are stored
digitally which offers tremendous potential for
disseminating data to different audiences in
different ways . 
KEY SKILL cont . 
Interpreting organic remains
Questions are usually about what could be learned in a general sense from the remains . To do
this you need to be familiar with common ways of presenting such data and what terms such
as MNI mean . Before you attempt this always consider the size of the sample . Are there
sufficient examples to say much at all ? Also comment on their survival : why have they survived
and in what ways may they have been transformed by taphonomic forces ( see p . 97 )  ?

Analytical techniques are often the parts of
archaeology courses which most students find
difficult . The bulleted points above are
sufficient for AS / A Level and some first year
undergraduate courses and do not require
detailed scientific knowledge . Most degree-level
courses will at some point require a greater
depth of understanding of scientific techniques
and most will involve practical work . Although
this will be taught , and there are many
excellent texts and ILT packages available , some
scientific knowledge is needed . The first half of
this chapter explains general approaches and
some widely used specific methods . The second
half of the chapter considers issues related to
particular types of material with examples
selected to illustrate what analysis can achieve . 
Further examples can be found in Part II of
this book . 
Analysis of finds and environmental data is
part of the process of compiling an excavation
or fieldwork archive . It takes place indoors , 
often in laboratories , and can involve a huge
range of specialists including zoologists , 
palynologists ( pollen ) and geologists . It is the
longest part of the excavation process , 
involving the most people , and is often the
most expensive . Consequently it will usually
have been planned long in advance . At the end
of the process the physical remains that have
been studied are put into storage and the
archaeological record becomes a collection of
written , graphical and electronic data and

YOUR GOALS
You need to understand
■ the range of specialisms involved in post excavation work and what they can contribute to
site archives
■ the types of analysis carried out on the most commonly analysed materials
■ the basic principles of the main analytical techniques
■ how to integrate a grasp of analytical techniques with specific examples
reports . It will then need interpretation ( see
Chapter 5 )  . The same principle of identification
and classification is used with finds retrieved in
other ways such as stray finds brought to
museums . 
Materials are treated differently according to
their properties . Robust artefacts such as flint
tools or pottery are cleaned in water unless
analysis of residues or wear is to be
undertaken . Fragile bones , metals artefacts and
wood are handled with delicacy and may
require conservation work before analysis can
begin . For example , bone may require
treatment with polyvinyl acetate ( PVA ) to stop
it crumbling while organic samples may require
mild fungicides to halt decay . The conditions
they are kept in will also vary depending on
their original context . 
ARCHAEOMETRY
Recent scientific advances have had a major
impact on archaeology with those in dating and
reconnaissance being the best known . 
However , just as inventions such as sonar and
GPS were developed for military rather than
archaeological purposes , an impressive range of
analytical techniques have also been adopted by
archaeologists . The growth of archaeometry ,

Figure 3 . 2 Simplified diagram of the post excavation process
the scientific analysis of archaeological
materials , has led to the creation of a whole
range of new archaeological specialisms as well
as degree courses which focus on the
application of science to archaeology . 
Scientific analysis offers many insights into
ancient objects and ecofacts including : 
1 Identification of finds or specimens
2 Determining numbers of finds or specimens
from particular categories
3 Identifying how materials were produced
and used
4 Identifying sources of artefacts and raw
materials
5 Providing data on the local environment
Scientific techniques can analyse and present
data rapidly but are often very expensive . This
means that scientific analysis is usually only
conducted with clear questions in mind that
help address the overall research questions . It
also means that only selected materials are
analysed . 
Is archaeology a science ? 
The adoption of scientific techniques and the
overlap between archaeology and biology in
the study of human origins led some archaeologists to claim that archaeology was now a
science . This would have advantages for
university departments since science enjoys
higher status and better funding than the
humanities . However , the use of scientific
techniques in itself doesn ’ t make a subject a
science . To be accepted as a science archaeology
would have to demonstrate that it is following
the principles of empirical methods with a view
to establishing ‘ laws ’  , or ‘ middle range theory ’ 
as it is often called . Although many research
archaeologists have adopted the scientific
model of generating a hypothesis and then
testing , it is difficult for archaeologists to form
law-like generalisations from their findings . 
While the relationships explored by scientists
in laboratory experiments can be repeatedly
tested under controlled conditions , archaeologists investigate unique events from the past
and deal with material which , once removed
from its context , can never be re-excavated .

Sorting pottery
types according to
attributes
VISUAL EXAMINATION
The first analytical stage for most materials
involves categorisation and enumeration 
( counting )  . Artefacts are sorted into types
while environmental samples , once removed
from soil , are identified by species . Each
category can then be counted in order to say
something about relative amounts in the
archive and to identify on-site distribution of
materials . For some materials this can be done
by eye but microscopes will also be used , 
especially for plant and invertebrate remains 
( see p . 76 )  . Specialists use their knowledge to
categorise finds but they will also have a set of
reference samples or illustrations to aid identification . These are sometimes called parallels . 
Artefacts will be sorted according to physical
characteristics or attributes into categories by
material and typology . There is no right way to
do this , but the end result will be classification
to enable description and enumeration .

Most museums will have a
type series for their area
Experts will often use the feel of artefacts to
assist them . Characteristics such as grittiness or
greasiness are best determined by touch . Some
materials , particularly metals will require
further tests . Microscope examination by
experts of marks on some materials can also
provide clues to their use . 
SCIENTIFIC ANALYSIS OF ARTEFACTS
Increasingly artefacts are investigated scientifically to determine their composition , structure
and manufacturing history . The type of analysis
selected in any particular case will depend on a
range of factors including cost , the importance
of the individual artefact and the questions the
archaeologists are asking . For example , 
petrology is relatively cheap , but it is also
destructive . X-ray fluorescence provides an
alternative , which doesn ’ t cause damage , but it
can only analyse the surface of objects . An
excellent range of links for scientific methods is
at the University of Bradford website . 

Characterisation studies
Scientific examination of analysis of artefacts
and building material can reveal their chemical
make-up . This is valuable because while stone
or metal of the same type is largely composed
of the same elements , their exact chemical
composition varies . Each stone or metal ore
was produced in a specific location under
particular geological conditions . These unique
circumstances mean that they contain slightly
different combinations and quantities of 
 ‘ impurities ’  . Copper , for example , may contain
minute amounts of arsenic , silver and lead . 
These ‘ trace elements ’ occur as a few parts per
million and may have negligible effects on the
material , but they provide it with a distinctive 
 ‘ chemical fingerprint ’  . Where the geological
sources of metal , clay or stone have been
mapped , archaeologists may be able to identify
the location from which the materials were
quarried . 
Petrology
This is a geological technique for locating the
source of minerals . A thin section of a stone or
ceramic artefact is cut , ground and polished till
it is about 0 . 02 mm thick . It is then examined
by microscope . The crystals of each mineral
have a distinctive colour and structure . The
particular combinations of key minerals enable
the original source to be established with
reference to geological maps . Thin sections of
pottery can also be studied to provide
information about manufacturing techniques . 
Petrology has contributed greatly to our
understanding of exchange , particularly in
prehistory . The sources for the early medieval
period trade in Lava quernstones throughout
north-west Europe have been traced back to
quarries in the Eiffel Mountains of Germany . 
The technique can be used for building
materials including stsone and , in some cases , 
brick . It has been used extensively in Egypt to
identify the quarries used to build the temples
at Karnak and the pyramid complex at Giza . 
Distribution patterns based on extensive studies
such as these have helped us understand the
complexity of ancient trade routes , transport
systems and economic organisation . 
Petrology does not work in all cases . Thin
sections of obsidian and flint look remarkably
similar regardless of where they originated . 
Similarly , ceramics , which lack distinctive
mineral tempers , require other techniques in
order to source them . 
62 ■ ARCHAEOLOGY COURSEBOOK
Spectrometry
Spectrometry covers a range of methods that
derive from physics and involve using radiation 
( for example X-rays ) to force a small sample of
material to produce light ( another form of
radiation ) which can be measured through
spectrographic analysis . In the way that
sunlight can be split in a rainbow , the light
emitted by different elements shows a characteristic pattern when split by a prism into its
spectrum . This is projected onto a viewing
screen or photographic plate , where its
information can be recorded . In a compound of
elements , the balance of elements is shown by
the intensity of the lines in the spectrum . This
is compared with control spectrums of known
composition produced under the same
conditions . Trace elements of a few parts per
million can be recorded in this way . 
Spectrometry is a very accurate method for
quantitative analysis and only requires small
samples ( less than 10 milligrams ) to be taken . 
This makes it suitable for valuable archaeological material . It is widely employed for
metal analysis but is also used for glass , faience , 
pottery , obsidian and occasionally flint . 
X-ray fluorescence
This technique is one of the cheaper and
quickest methods of analysing the surface
composition of materials , particularly metals . 
It is also non-destructive . A beam of X-rays
forces the material to re-emit X-rays . The
intensity of energy given off can be measured
to indicate the chemicals present and their
relative abundance . Since the method does not
penetrate deeply it is of little use where
materials have a coating of another mineral . 
A more advanced method uses protons to
penetrate more deeply but it is also more
expensive . 
Neutron activation analysis ( NAA ) 
This is the most accurate and reliable characterisation technique . Tiny samples are ground
down and then bombarded with neutrons in a
reactor . Elements in the sample become
unstable isotopes and give off distinctive
patterns of radiation , which can be measured . 
The technique is so sensitive that elements
present in a few parts per billion can be
detected . The technique has been used in
studies of similar ceramics in Iron Age Central
Europe to establish that technology and
designs were exchanged over wide areas rather
than pottery . It is useful for a wide range of
materials and is particularly appropriate for
coins . Unfortunately it is expensive . The
analysis of a single sample costs about £100 . 
Chemical analysis
The use of chemistry to identify elements such
as phosphate in topsoil has already been
mentioned . In addition , chemistry can be used
for characterisation studies of stone and metal
and identifying organic residues surviving in
ceramics . 
Isotopic analysis
Isotopes are elements with an abnormal
number of electrons . Copper , lead , oxygen and
carbon all have several different isotopes . By
determining what isotopes are present , and in
what proportions , materials can be linked to
known sources with the same ratios . It was
used to analyse metal artefacts from early
Bronze Age Crete . These had distinctive
Cretan styles but the ores of the metals are not
found on Crete . Ratios for lead isotopes in the
bronze and silver enabled the material to be
linked to sources on the mainland . This
showed that raw materials rather than finished
objects were being traded . Trade in copper and

marble around the Mediterranean has also been
traced using isotopic analysis . In the case of
marble , petrology had not been able to differentiate the stone . 
Organic residue analysis
Solvents and in some cases reagents can be used
to dissolve and extract chemical traces of
organic materials from sherds of pottery . The
resulting solution can be tested for sugars , 
lipids ( fats ) and other chemicals . The results
can be matched to ‘ fingerprints ’ known from
commodities such as honey , olive oil and plant
resins . A team from Bradford University is
currently using this technique to study the bulk
import of liquids into Bronze Age Egypt
through analysis of amphorae sherds . 
Unfortunately the process is too expensive to
be widely used . Some sites produce thousands
of sherds while the analysis of a single sample
would cost around £10 . 
ANALYSIS OF PARTICULAR INORGANIC
MATERIALS
Ceramic analysis
Pottery is very important to archaeology from
the Neolithic onwards because it survives well
in almost any environment . It provides dating
evidence and can be used make inferences
about exchange , economy and society . To
categorise sherds , colour is described by
reference to the Munsell Soil Colour Charts . 
There are similar charts for hardness and the
grain size of inclusions in the temper . Such
analysis may require the use of polarising
microscopes . Manufacturing by hand , coil or
wheel methods can usually be determined
visually , as can form . The key indicators here
are sherds from the rim , neck and base of
vessels . Where possible pots are reassembled by
specialists for recording . Refiring experiments
will show how the original baking was carried
out . 
The fabric colour and hardness provide clues to
firing temperatures . Clay often contains iron , 
which forms a red oxide if it is heated in an
oxygen rich environment or a black / grey oxide
if it is oxygen poor . The colour of the
molecules of clay indicates which was the case . 
If the clay is vitrified ( where minerals have
melted and fused together ) it indicates that
firing occurred in a kiln at temperatures in
excess of 1100°C . Slips and glazes provide
additional clues to origins and period . 
The standard way to illustrate ceramics is to
draw the whole artefact in outline but with a
quarter cut away . This enables a cross-section
of the vessel walls to be shown . Illustration of
decoration may be limited to the particular
sherds recovered . 
In quantifying pottery finds there is debate
amongst archaeologists over whether the
number or weight of sherds is more useful . For
instance there are rarely enough diagnostic
sherds ( for example rims ) to clearly identify the
number of original pots . A large urn may break
into several large but heavy pieces while a small
pot may shatter into many small light
fragments . Depending on which measure is
chosen the results can be widely different . 
Increasingly archaeologists measure both , but
weight used in conjunction with average sherd
weight can be used to reduce variability caused
by different sizes of vessels . 
Clay is almost entirely formed from eroded
sedimentary rocks , but a tiny percentage of the
material is made up of trace elements . 
Petrology and other characterisation techniques
can be applied to pottery and bricks although 
 ‘ fingerprinting ’ clay sources is much more
64 ■ ARCHAEOLOGY COURSEBOOK
difficult and well developed than is the case
with rocks . In many cases , experts on regional
pottery will be able to suggest the origin of
artefacts from the temper and inclusions in the
pottery , which they identify from visual or
microscopic examination . 
The Ashmolean Museum website has an
excellent guide to the value of pottery to
archaeologists . 

Lithic analysis
Lithics or stone tools are virtually
indestructible . They have been used for all but
the earliest stages of human development and
for many sites and periods are the only definite
sign of human activity . Examination of their
surface can determine whether they were
manufactured by fracturing , pecking or
polishing the original stone . Reference to
experimental or ethnographic examples

KEY TERM
Use wear analysis
For some artefacts , including stone tools , 
tiny scratches and traces are left from past
activity . For example , half an hour cutting
cereals will leave a polish on a flint blade . 
Expert analysis backed by examples from
experimental archaeology ( see p . 102 ) 
can sometimes identify the signatures of
different activities . However , this may only
reveal the last activity the tool was used
for . The detection and description of wear
marks can be greatly assisted by the use of
a scanning electron microscope ( SEM )  , 
which by sweeping a band of electrons over
the surface of the tool being studied gives
much improved depth of focus and higher
magnification . This enhanced image can
then be displayed on a screen . Recent work
has involved the study of starch grains on
stone blades in Polynesia and the analysis
of blood residues on some of the
equipment carried by Otzi the Ice Man . 
Similar ideas have been applied to the
examination of cut marks on bones , for
example in studies to determine whether
early hominids were predators or
scavengers .  
( see Chapter 5 ) can help identify signs of
techniques such as indirect percussion and
pressure flaking . Artefacts can be sorted by
type of stone , colour and typology . Specialists
will use reference material for relative dating
and suggestion of function . Manufacturing
debris ( debitage ) is often recovered and
sometimes can be refitted to show the sequence
of manufacturing and even whether the knapper
was sitting or standing , left- or right-handed . 
Petrology has been the most widely used means
of characterisation for lithics although the other
techniques are increasingly used . 
Metallurgical analysis
Some metal artefacts require special treatment
to remove corrosion . They may also need 
X-raying to see the shape of the artefact
beneath a crust of oxidised material or to
identify cracks or seams where several pieces of
metal were joined to form complex artefacts . 
Metallurgists use microscopes to explore
manufacturing techniques . Metallography
includes examination of the size and shape of
the grains of minerals in the material for traces
of heating , working and alloying . Where they
are available , SEMs are preferred . Their
magnification at 1000x may be similar to the
best optical microscopes but the depth of field
they provide enables fine detail to be identified . 
This is particularly important when exploring
the manufacturing techniques used in jewellery
or weapons making . The manufacture of iron
sword blades often involved hammering folded
layers of metal . This process can be detected by
examining a cross-section of the blade . Analysis
of the carbon content may reveal enrichment
due to roasting in charcoal in order to produce
resilient weapons . 
The first recorded use of metal is in the form
of jewellery and ritual items . These were made
from ‘ soft ’ metals ( gold and copper ) which
would be worked by hammering . Only very
simple objects could be made this way . 
Complex items required moulds into which
molten metal could be poured . Stone , metal
and clay moulds have survived together with
by-products of manufacturing such as
crucibles , slag and waste metal . Artefacts
themselves provide evidence of casting errors , 
mould seams , cold working after casting and
decorative techniques . 
Metal objects were frequently ornamented by
means of a range of engraving tools whose
shapes may be identified when magnified . In
the case of the Gundestrup Cauldron , Taylor
was able to identify the number of punches
used to decorate it suggesting the number of
craftsmen involved . The style of decoration
also enabled him to identify the region and
ethnic identity of the makers . 
Scientific American 266 ( 3 ) 
Taylor 1997
Greene 2000
Besides the characterisation techniques already
discussed a number of other methods are used
with metals . Measuring the specific gravity of
artefacts and comparing with known examples
often identified alloys of gold . A more precise
technique is atomic absorption spectrometry 
( AAS )  . A small sample is dissolved in acid and
then vaporised . When light of known
wavelengths is passed through the gas , the
amount that is absorbed indicates the minerals
present . This technique has been used to trace
the seventh-century debasement of coins in the
Merovingian Empire . AAS is also widely used
for bronze and copper . A limitation of this
66 ■ ARCHAEOLOGY COURSEBOOK
technique is that where metal artefacts were
made from several sources the ‘ fingerprint ’ is
obscured . In the ancient world , valuable
commodities such as bronze were often
recycled with new artefacts made from scrap
from a variety of sources . 
The study of coins is a very specialised area . 
The analytical techniques already described
provide information on the metals used . The
degree of debasement in gold and silver coins
can be used as an approximate form of dating
although the images and inscriptions on the
surface are usually more valuable . Coins have
been used to explore topics as diverse as trade , 
territories and particular events . 
ANALYSIS OF ORGANIC REMAINS
Soil
The chemistry of soil can provide clues to the
type of vegetation and by extension , fauna and
agriculture it could support . The early farmers
in central Europe , for example , seemed to
favour particular soil types for their farming
settlements . Soil change can also record the
impact of humans on the land . Sediments in
valleys in Cyprus were used to explain the
abandonment of Bronze Age sites . 
Deforestation or overgrazing had led to erosion
of topsoil on the hillsides which had then been
deposited in the valleys . Soil is also analysed

KEY SKILL
Noting methods of analysis
The vast range of scientific methods used by archaeologists to analyse materials looks very
daunting at first site . The key to starting to grasp them is to learn some of the more commonly
used approaches and to understand them in simple terms before you tackle specialist texts . We
have adopted this approach in the selection presented in this text . After reading this section , 
you should make some notes to clarify points in your own mind . There is little point in
rewriting this chapter so a useful exercise would be to turn some key points into the table

for what it holds . Pollen , invertebrates and
even microbes can be recovered to provide
clues about environment and economy . 
Faunal remains
Archaeozoology or zooarchaeology is the
study of the remains of animals from archaeological contexts . Humans interact with animals
in several ways including their use for human
food or other resources and indirectly as the
occupants of ecological niche alongside
humans . Faunal ( which for our purposes
includes fish and birds as well as mammals ) 
remains are vital to archaeologists in two ways : 
to reconstruct past environments ( see p . 169 ) 
and to identify the contribution which animals
made to the human economy ( see p . 197 )  . 
Bones survive best in arid or waterlogged
conditions but alkaline soils , including welldrained sand or gravel , usually preserve some
bones . Acidic soil can destroy all but burnt
bone . Many sites turn up vast quantities of
bone and in some cases archaeologists opt not
to collect or record it . Where they do collect it , 
samples are often biased towards larger animals
and larger bones . Bird and fish bones in
particular are often omitted . This is partly
through poor survival and partly because of
recovery problems . Flotation can be used to
recover them but large numbers of samples are
needed for conclusions to be drawn . 
The first element in analysis of bone
assemblages once bones are identified is
establishing how many animals of each species
are present . Because it is rare for whole
skeletons to be present , two calculations of
numbers are made : 
Number of identified specimens present –
NISP
Minimum number of individuals – MNI
The raw data only shows the relative
abundance of a particular species not how
important it was to people and their economy . 
There is more meat on a cow than on a sheep , 
so while the MNI for sheep may be greater
than for cows , they may contribute much less
to the overall diet . Several additional measures
have been developed to assess dietary contribution such as meat weight versus bone weight . 
A further complication arises when we
consider the body elements that are present . 
Some animals may not have been slaughtered
on-site and bones that are low in meat , such as
the spine and feet , may have been discarded
off-site . Careful examination of butchery marks
can reveal the process by which animal bone
reached the site of deposition . 
68 ■ ARCHAEOLOGY COURSEBOOK
Figure 3 . 7 Animal bones after washing
Establishing the age and sex of the animals
represented in a bone assemblage can help
reconstruct the system of hunting or
agriculture practised ( see p . 198 )  . For
example , the sex ratio and age structure in
herds of cattle kept for dairy products are
different from those kept for meat . The sex of
bones can be identified from anatomical
features such as antlers ( deer )  , large canines 
( pig ) and penis bone ( dog ) in males and pelvic
shape and structure in females . The dimensions
of bones can also be used as males are larger in
many species . The ratio between two or more
measurements from one bone is used rather
than a single measure ( for example length ) as
that may be dependent on the age of the
animal . Identification of changes in the
skeleton , especially the fusion of bone
elements , and patterns of eruption , growth and
wear in teeth are used to age animals . Tooth
eruption and antler shedding may establish the
season of death of the animals . However , such
analysis is not always reliable , as bones may
not have been deposited at the time the animals
were killed . Note that Star Carr was thought to
be a winter site from antler evidence , but recent
discoveries of stork and crane bones suggest it
was used in summer . 
Bones can be used to approximately date sites . 
For example , reindeer bones on a site might
indicate a period during the last ice age . Smaller
mammals such as voles , which evolve quickly , 
are often the most useful for this faunal
dating . It is also possible to analyse bone
collagen for dating and for environmental
information from the minerals and amino acids
it contains . Animals provide clues to the
environment although we cannot always be
certain that they occupied similar habitats to
today ’ s animals . Bones can also provide insights
into human behaviour . The spread of species
may be related to trade while analysis of
damage to bones provides data on hunting , 
butchery and craft technology . 
Human remains
Human remains can be divided into two major
categories : hard and soft tissue . The evidence
that these two types provide and the conditions
in which they are preserved vary considerably . 
Soft tissue
Like other organic remains , soft tissue is only
usually recovered on sites with unusually good
preservation . They are not likely to be a

Figure 3 . 8 Drawing of bone evidence from a

found whose teeth fitted exactly the marks on
the skull of a young hominid . This was used to
demonstrate that hominid remains in caves do
not always mean that the hominid lived there
representative sample of the wider population
but are useful none the less . 
Desiccated ( dried ) bodies such as Egyptian
mummies often preserve facial features well , if
a little distorted from the drying process , 
together with internal organs , nails and hair . 
Accurate sexing of the body can usually be
done from the external sexual organs , or from
facial hair . There are always exceptions .  
 ‘ Mummy 1770 ’  , which had probably spent
some time in the Nile as a result of an
unfortunate encounter with a crocodile , could
not be sexed at the time of mummification by
the priests . He / she was therefore prepared for
either eventuality in the afterlife by being given
both a false penis made of a roll of bandage , 
and gold nipples . In addition to providing
details of clothing and mortuary practices , 
tissue samples can be rehydrated to give useful
evidence about disease , for example the sand
pneumoconiosis suffered by one of ‘ The
Brothers ’ in Manchester Museum . Dry sites
sometimes also provide copralites . Analysis of
these can recover hair , bone , seed and parasites
to reveal information about diet and health . 
Analysis of deposits from the latrines at
Bearsden Roman Fort revealed little trace of
cholesterol but lots of wheat bran , suggesting
that the legionaries ate little meat . The Dungfile
website provides all the links you might want .

Frozen corpses like Otzi the Ice Man and the
Pazyryk ‘ Ice Maiden ’ provide similar evidence
to dry bodies except that stomach contents are
often preserved as well . The general level of
distortion and decay is often so low that these
bodies can almost seem asleep not dead . The
Peruvian Inca children are especially extraordinary in this respect . In one case the trauma
that caused death – a blow to the head – could
still be identified in a CAT scan . In another
example the red-stained vomit from the
symbolic ‘ achiote ’ dye that the child had been
forced to ingest still marked his face and the
front of his clothing . Without Otzi ’ s preserved
skin we would not have known about his
tattoos , which may be the earliest evidence of
medicinal acupuncture . 
Bodies from anaerobic conditions such as the
famous ‘ bog bodies ’ of northern Europe , 
including Lindow and Tollund Man , have been
used to study diet , internal parasites and
trauma . The acid nature of bogs can lead to the
almost complete demineralisation of bone while
tanning the skin to perfection .

In some soil conditions , in East Anglia for
example , where the soil is wet and acid , neither
hard nor soft tissue survives well . The only
surviving trace of the presence of a body may
be a stain in the bottom of the grave that
provides a silhouette of the original body . The 
 ‘ sand man ’ in Mound 1 at Sutton Hoo may
have been such a burial . 

Hard tissue
Bone is much more frequently recovered by
archaeologists than soft tissue . Similar analysis
to that used on faunal remains is carried out to
determine the composition of assemblages of
human remains . 
Species . Many aspects of bone morphology are
used to identify and classify the various species
of early humans . For example Homo sapiens
neanderthalensis is recognised by its long low
skull , large nasal aperture and huge square
teeth . 
Sexing . The principal ways to establish sex
from human bones are through examination of
the pelvis . The space at the front of this bone is
larger in women than men to allow for the
passage of the baby ’ s head during birth . 
Women are therefore said to possess a larger
sub-pubic arch . In the blade of the pelvis , 
below the socket for the hipbone ( femur )  , is
the sciatic notch to which is applied a rough 
 ‘ rule of thumb ’  , in the words of the forensic
anthropologist Rebecca Storey .  ‘ You stick your
thumb in and if it wiggles it ’ s female and if it
doesn ’ t it ’ s male !  ’ The brow ridge is often
larger and projects further in males than
females but this is less reliable . Because of
widespread variation amongst males and
females no physical method is totally reliable
and it is almost impossible to sex children . 
DNA testing is accurate , but is very expensive . 
Ageing . As with animals , age is generally
established by examination of bone fusion rates 
( epiphysial fusion ) and tooth eruption . Bones
fuse at different rates during an individual ’ s life
until full maturity in a person ’ s twenties . Using
wear on bones to estimate age for older
individuals is notoriously unreliable . Theya
Molleson made a comparative study on the
collection from Spitalfields Crypt where the

POST-EXCAVATION ANALYSIS ■ 71
Figure 3 . 10 Drawing of a hominid skull from
a very different species to our own . In this
case , Homo erectus from around 1 million to
500 , 000 years ago
actual ages were known from the coffin plates . 
In the case of Louisa Courtauld , the archaeological estimate of her age using bone was
wrong by over twenty years . However , a newer
technique of thin-sectioning teeth , which relies
on measuring the amount of translucence in the
root , provided a much closer estimate . 
Health . Where a large sample of human bones
is recovered one can start to gain some
tentative insights into age structure and health
of the population . Some diseases leave marks
on bones . These include polio , tuberculosis and
genetic disorders such as cleft palate , along
with syphilis and various types of cancer . Early
medical treatments such as trepanation ( cutting
or drilling a hole in the skull ) are also fairly
common . 
Damage to the skeleton through accidents , 
activities undertaken during life , murder and
warfare injuries and even childbirth can all be
evidenced by physical traces left on bone . 
Female skeletons at Tell Abu Hureyra ( see 
p . 247 ) were shown to have traces of arthritis
from using grindstones , while the murder of
prisoners at the Battle of Towcester has
recently been investigated through meticulous
examination of skeletons from a pit near the
battle site . 

depart / report97 / towton . htm 

meettheancestors / index . shtml
Diet . The main approach to diet relies upon
studies of isotopic traces in bone . Particular
diets such as one dependent on marine foods or
one heavy in maize consumption will leave a
signature in the bone collagen . A Homo
erectus from Lake Turkana was found to have
an extra scab of bone around its femur . The
most likely cause was an excess of vitamin A
caused by eating too much raw meat , especially
liver ; a reminder that the transition of our
species from plant eaters to meat eaters was not
without its problems . Tooth wear is also used
to demonstrate gritty diets while earth from the
abdominal area of buried skeletons can be
analysed for pollen and seeds which may have
been in the stomach . 

depart / resgrp / palaeodiet / 
Genetic links . Shared genetic differences in
populations often have a visible effect on bone , 
which allows people with this trait to be
grouped together . Much work has been done in
this area in the USA in order to establish tribal
affiliations for government programmes to
repatriate bones from museums to their tribal
homelands and also to trace the origins of
diseases currently affecting native populations . 
Through the application of PCR ( polymerise
chain reaction ) genetic scientists have amplified

torso of this skeleton emerging from its grave
at Spitalfields , will always survive better than
soft tissue
small amounts of genetic material found in
archaeological contexts . This has enabled
human evolution to be traced . Through the
study of mitochondrial DNA , the identity of
the female founder of our species , the ‘ African
Eve ’  , has been established . 
Organic artefacts
Organic artefacts are far rarer in archaeology
than those made of stone and clay . Inevitably
this has distorted our view of the past because
so much material culture is invisible to us . 
Sites where organic finds survive in large
amounts are unusual and in some cases may
not be ‘ typical ’ sites . However , they do 
provide tantalising glimpses of the skills , 
culture and economics of the periods in the
past from which they came . A breathtaking
example of surviving textiles at the Spitalfields
Market site illustrates this point particularly
well . 
Textiles , including wool , silk and leather , only
usually survive in wet contexts . Great care
must be taken during the removal of such
artefacts from the ground . The usual practice is

KEY SITE
Spitalfields Market
During the excavation of Spitalfields
Market in the City of London , a lead coffin
dating to the Roman period was found
within a stone sarcophagus . Inside lay the
body of a well-nourished young woman in
her early twenties . Glass and jet grave
goods and the elaborate nature and
decoration of her coffin indicated that she
was of high status . Her clothes , which were
preserved in the wet sludge in the bottom
of the coffin , underlined this impression , for
they were of superb quality . Two distinct
materials were discoverable under the
microscope . 
The first was a gossamer chequered weave
of damask silk . This was fabricated in the
workshops of Damascus in Syria from silk
imported from China . It relied for its effect
on the play of light on its surface creating 
 ‘ interference colours ’  , like the wings of
tropical birds . It must have created a truly
exotic impression in the streets of Roman
London . 
The second garment was woollen , probably
dyed with purple . This too was a status
symbol . The dyestuff was obtained from
Murex shellfish in the eastern
Mediterranean and was interwoven with
very fine strands of gold foil , carefully
twisted into gold tubes encasing the
woollen threads . 

archaeology / princess_1 . shtml
Figure 3 . 12 Wet sites are of such value
because of the range of organic ecofacts and
artefacts that are preserved on them . Wood , 
such as this shoe-bottom from Empingham , 
rarely survives on dry sites
to isolate the artefacts , leaving them lying on a
block of soil . A supporting base is then slid
underneath . Such artefacts are bagged and kept
wet until consolidation and conservation can
take place in a laboratory . 
Plants
For the archaeologist samples of plant remains
divide into the microscopic and the
macroscopic . Both types usually require
specialised methods of conservation and
analysis . Plants can tell the archaeologist about
past climate , economic practices , the nature of
past environment and environmental change . 
We can explore the exploitation of plants for
food , medicinal and narcotic purposes while
the study of wood leads us into construction , 
carpentry and woodland management . 
Plant macrofossils
Plant macrofossils are specimens that are visible
to the naked eye . They include seeds , leaves
and twigs . They are usually preserved in the
following unusual conditions : 
■ Waterlogged , where wet anaerobic
conditions inhibit the growth of the
bacteria that cause decomposition . For
example , bran in Lindow Man ’ s stomach 
or moss used as ‘ toilet paper ’ in Viking
York . 
■ Carbonised , where charring has converted
material to inorganic carbon which is less
susceptible to the forces of decay , for
example grain in the pits at Danebury . 
■ Mineralised , where the organic content of
the specimen is replaced by minerals such as
iron and manganese from groundwater in
the soil . 
■ Frozen , usually in conditions of permafrost
when the ground is permanently frozen and
organic remains within it can be perfectly
preserved , for example coriander seeds in
the ‘ Ice Maiden ’ s ’ grave or the stomach
contents of Siberian mammoths . 
■ As impressions in mudbrick , pottery or
daub , for example corns cobs at Ceren and
olives at Pompeii . 
Wood
Dealing with wood from archaeological
contexts presents huge problems , but may also
offer sources of evidence unavailable elsewhere . 
Leaving aside its use for dating through
dendrochronology , wood is valuable as physical
evidence for structure and artefacts . 
Archaeologists cannot study carpentry practices
from the past , which involved complex joinery , 
without part of a ship or building to show how
the joint was made . The discovery of wooden
structures is also important in revealing the
huge range of uses to which wood was put in
the past . 
Shipwrecks such as the Vasa or Mary Rose are
time capsules : a moment frozen in time . Inside
these two warships were a bewildering array of
wooden artefacts from mundane spoons and
bowls to sophisticated navigational aids . See
also the shipwrecks discussed on p . 221 . 

Similar ranges of wooden implements have
been recovered from crannogs such as
Oakbank in Loch Tay and ‘ fennogs ’ like Flag
Fen . In addition to domestic utensils such as
wooden ‘ porridge ’ spoons , the huge numbers
of wooden piles used to construct these sites
speak eloquently about the ability to fell , shape
and move massive tonnages of timber in
prehistory . The Sweet Track on the Somerset
Levels also provided evidence of Neolithic
carpentry and woodland management . Three
74 ■ ARCHAEOLOGY COURSEBOOK
tree species had been selected for particular
roles in construction and produced by coppicing to suit the demands of a wet environment . 
Huge quantities of timber were also recovered
in excavations of the London waterfront . 
It was too expensive to conserve all of the
material so selection and sampling had to take
place . Some of the wharf timbers proved to be
the remains of derelict buildings . This enabled
the development of carpentry and construction
techniques to be studied over an extended
period . 
All of this material derived from wet contexts . 
The wood , though flimsy and insubstantial , 
retains much of its form and details such as axe
marks . Wood from dry contexts also sometimes
survives but is frequently warped and distorted . 
Once wood is removed from a wet environment , decay sets in rapidly unless proactive
measures are taken . Observations at Oakbank
showed that excavated wood when freshly
broken retained the colour of fresh timber , but
once exposed to the air the wood turned black
in about twenty seconds . In the short term
wood is kept wet with biocides added to the
water to prevent fungal growth . Longer term
conservation may involve freeze-drying but
this is only a viable option for artefacts and
small timbers . Larger specimens require
different techniques . Replacing the water in the
cells of the wood with a soluble wax such as
PEG ( polyethylene glycol ) treats shipwreck
timbers , which have the consistency of wet
cardboard and consist of 80–90 per cent water . 
This treatment can be very time-consuming . 
The Mary Rose , which has been treated with
PEG , is still not ready for display more than
ten years after she was raised . 
Indirect evidence for the use of wood can also
be detected . At Sutton Hoo the imprint of 
an Anglo-Saxon ship ’ s timbers remained in 
the sand while at Garton Slack there was a
stain from the varnished spokes of a chariot ’ s
wheels . 
Other plant macrofossils
The quantity of plant material in natural
sediments is usually low but on archaeological
sites can be abnormally high , especially where
activities such as deposition of food waste and
human faeces ( coprolites ) or food processing
and storage has have taken place . 
Archaeologists must also bear in mind that care
must be taken in presentation of data if the
sheer quantity of small seeds produced by
some species is not to artificially dominate an
assemblage at the expense of other species
which produce fewer and larger seeds . 
A comparison between the size of poppy seeds
and almonds makes this point . 
On most sites archaeologists will want to know
about the local environment and the use of
plant foods including crops ( see Chapter 10 )  . 
However , biases can occur in samples for a
number of reasons . Differential survival may
bias the range of plants known from a
particular period either because plants do not
preserve well or because they grow in locations
lacking suitable conditions for preservation . 
People may also have introduced plants into
the site either deliberately through plant
collecting or cultivation or by accident as in the
case of Otzi the Ice Man , in the form of cereal
grains adhering to his grass cape . This means
that the archaeologist must study very carefully
the formation processes ( see Chapter 5 ) that
led to the creation of the deposit that contains
the plant remains under consideration . 
Through the study of ethnographic parallels for
the processing of plants in contemporary
societies that still rely on simple technology , 
archaeologists have reached a good under1111

standing of the main stages of processing . 
These are usually reaping , sowing , winnowing
and threshing . Each stage produces a characteristic assemblage of plant macrofossils
according to which parts of the plant are left
by that point – at the storage stage , for
example , one would expect to find an
assemblage dominated by clean grains with 
few remnants of stalk or husk present . 
Plant microfossils
Plant microfossils are remains that can usually
be studied only using microscopes . Three types
that are important to archaeologists are pollens , 
diatoms and phytoliths . 
Pollen
The study of pollen is known as palynology . 
The species of individual grains of pollen are
readily identifiable by palynologists through
their characteristic shapes . They survive well , 
especially in wet acid conditions , because they
possess a tough outer case . Pollen can be
retrieved from most soil samples but is most
useful when taken by coring or from a column
of samples from a ditch or pit to show
vegetation changes . Species frequency in
samples can be counted and the numerical data
plotted to show relative quantities . Some
species produce more pollen then others , so
depending on wind , animal and human action a
particular assemblage of pollen may represent a
very local or a more regional sample . 
The relative quantities of pollens provide a
record of environmental change . In wellresearched areas it has been possible to define
pollen zones which characterise particular
periods according to the relative amounts of
each species . These pollen assemblages can be
used to assign relative dates to samples from
76 ■ ARCHAEOLOGY COURSEBOOK
Figure 3 . 13 Drawings of examples of magnified pollen grains , illustrating the different shapes for 
each species
other sites according to where they match the
established environmental sequence . This is
known as pollen dating ( see p . 83 )  . The
samples can also be dated using radiocarbon
dating . 
Diatoms
Diatoms are microscopic single-celled plants
usually found in open water or in wet
conditions such as bogs and waterlogged soils . 
They are very sensitive to changes in their local
water . Their hard outer shell survives well in
alkaline or anaerobic conditions . Changes
caused by human action such as deforestation
or pollution can be inferred from changes in
the species of diatom . 
Phytoliths
Phytoliths are silica from the cells of plants . 
They survive well enough in alkaline soils to be
identified to particular groups of plants . It has
been suggested that sickle gloss on flint blades
from the early Neolithic in the Near East is
indirect evidence of abrasive cereal phytoliths , 
while in Mesoamerica maize phytoliths have
been used to demonstrate the spread of
agriculture . 
Invertebrates
The shells of many tiny living creatures are
surprisingly resilient . They provide evidence of
the local environment and in some cases human
diet and activity , as with the layers of seashells
in coastal middens . Two important categories
are beetles and snails . 
Beetles
Beetles ( or Coleoptera ) are one of the most
diverse types of invertebrate and they can be
found in virtually every environment . Their
shell or exoskeleton is very resistant to decay
and sufficiently variable to allow identification
sometimes down to species level . In evolutionary terms , beetles have changed very little
for tens of thousands of years , so comparison

KEY STUDY
The decline of the Maya
Rue ( 1989 ) collected samples by coring a peat bog to produce a long thin column of sediment
which encapsulated the environmental history of the Copan valley . Once processed the data
revealed a surprise . The general view was that Maya society declined rapidly after AD 800 so
Rue expected this would be reflected in the pollen evidence with maize being less prominent
and tree pollen becoming dominant as the forest cover regenerated . In fact maize continued to
be planted until at least AD 1100 and only after that did hardwoods like the mahogany , 
suggestive of fully established rainforest , became apparent on a large scale . Either the
standard textbooks about the Maya were wrong or Rue ’ s data were . His results were supported
by Freter , who was working on obsidian hydration dating of blades found on Maya sites of this
period . Her dates also suggested a long drawn out decline over several hundred years rather
than a cataclysmic demise for the Maya . This provided a new ‘ model ’ to explain the end of
Maya civilisation and also highlights the view of modern archaeology as a discipline made up
of many subdisciplines which often provide complementary evidence and news way of looking
of samples with modern reference collections is
relatively straightforward . The large number of
types of beetle can make species lists rather
unhelpful as there may be up to fifty species
present in a collection of 100 specimens with
only one or two in each category . A more
profitable approach has been to group species
together by their food or habitat preferences
into classes such as ‘ phytophages ’  ( plant eater ) 
or ‘ obligate aquatics ’  ( living in water )  . 
Archaeologists can then discover their local
habitat and what taphonomic processes 
( see p . 97 ) led to their decomposition in a
particular deposit . The kind of archaeological
information provided by the beetles can be
summarised as follows : 
■ Reconstruction of ground surface
conditions . Buckland ( 1976 ) used beetles to
analyse the floors of houses at Reykholb in
order to infer the use of different rooms . 
■ Reconstruction of vegetation and climate . 
The discovery of Oades gracilis in southern
Britain during the Palaeolithic has been
used to infer the existence of much cooler
conditions during glacial periods since this
species now has a largely Arctic distribution . 
■ Information about stored products and the
utilisation of plants resources . In Roman
granaries at York grain beetles have been
discovered which prove the exploitation of
cereals even though there is no physical
evidence of the plants themselves . 
Molluscs
Land snail shells are preserved in calcareous , 
chalky soils because their shells are made of
calcium carbonate ( chalk )  . Most snails are so
small ( around 2 mm ) that you can ’ t normally
see them . Those larger snails you may have
seen , or even eaten , are much bigger and
represent only three or four varieties of the
hundreds of species of snail . Snails are
especially useful to archaeologists as different
species have particular vegetation habitats . 
Microscopic shells are carefully sieved out of
the soil ( rather like seeds )  , identified and
counted by the specialist . All snails need shade
as they must not dry out , but some species are
more tolerant to areas with less shade . This
enables classification into three broad groups . 
Open country species can survive in grassland
areas with little shade , unlike the woodland
group . A catholic group is frequently found in
both habitats , but some have quite specific
preferences . Snails do not move far so although
you cannot tell what any past habitat was like
from just one or two shells , you can from a
whole assemblage .

AFTER ANALYSIS
Finally all the reports are united with the
dating evidence and the fieldwork record as 
a complete site archive . It still needs to be
interpreted . In the tradition of scientific
reporting , published archaeological reports tend
to be descriptive and analytical with a fairly
minimal amount of assessment and interpretation . The archive is there for others to draw
their conclusions from . For members of the
public and many students , reports are often
frustrating . What they want are the works of
synthesis and interpretation that are largely
produced by academic rather than field
archaeologists . The examples and discussions in
Part II of this book are largely drawn from
these interpretative accounts .

KEY SKILL
Reinforcing class learning of methods
Learning methods can sometimes be dull , 
and comparing and contrasting them can
be difficult . One approach is to use games . 
Two examples follow : 
Balloon debate . Several students are each
given the name of a different development
in archaeology . They have to prepare in
advance to answer questions on it , 
including providing examples . On the day of
the debate the chosen students have to
argue ‘ X has been the most important
contribution to archaeology in the last 100
years .  ’ The rest of the class have to each
ask a question and will then vote for the
winner . Over the course , similar debates
could be used to ensure that all students
have a go . The game builds up skills in
argument too . 
Who or what am I ? Cards are dealt out
with methods written on them . Without
looking at it , one student sticks their card
to their forehead . They then have ten
questions to guess what they are . The other
students can only answer yes or no . 
Archaeologists have used many different
techniques to work out the age of artefacts and
sites for which they have no historical dates
and the order in which they were used . These
dating techniques can be broadly subdivided
into two groups : 
■ Relative dating techniques which identify
the order in which sites or artefacts were
used in a sequence from earliest to latest . 
■ Absolute ( or chronometric ) dating
techniques that try to establish an exact or
approximate calendar date for a site or
artefact . 
The techniques selected depend on the specific
task and evidence as well as practical considerations such as cost . Many of the scientific
techniques are expensive and require high levels
of technical skill to use and to interpret . The
span of human history studied by archaeologists is so vast and environments so varied
that techniques suitable for one place and
period may be unsuitable for another . 
Historical dating
For sites less than 5 , 000 years old there may be
written or artistic evidence which can provide
precise dates as long as the original language
can be decoded . For example , coins , seals , 
inscriptions and clay tablets were used by the
civilisations of the Mediterranean and Middle
East . Sometimes historical records such as
dates , calendars or lists of rulers are available . 
These have allowed sites such as Egyptian

tombs or Mayan temples to be precisely dated . 
When artefacts from these civilisations appear
in non-literate areas they can be used to
provide approximate dates in those areas . 
Flinders Petrie , an archaeologist working in
Egypt in the 1900s , was able to use pottery
from Egyptian sites that had been dated against
historical records to cross-date sites in Greece
where the same pottery occurred . For more
recent periods the exact dates for the
introduction of many artefacts from clay pipes
to beer bottles are known and can be used to
date sites . Where artefacts are used for dating it
is critical that their precise position within the
stratigraphy is accurately recorded . Such 
 ‘ indirect dating ’ of sites provides two types of
date : 
■ Terminus post quem ( TPQ )  : the earliest
possible date for an archaeological deposit
■ Terminus ante quem ( TAQ )  : the latest
possible date for the deposit
RELATIVE DATING
Typology
In its simplest form , this involves putting a
number of finds into chronological order . On a
site with a clear and undisturbed stratigraphy , 
items from lower levels are older than those in
higher levels . In the nineteenth century , 
observations about the types of artefact from
different layers led to the creation of a time
frame for prehistory known as the ‘ 3 age
system ’  , based on the introduction of tools
made from stone then bronze then iron . Today
many flaws are apparent in this scheme but the
terms are still used to distinguish different 
 ‘ periods ’ in the past . A more sophisticated
technique was popularised by Flinders Petrie in
the 1900s . He noted that the design and
decoration of pottery from the Egyptian tombs
he excavated changed gradually over time . 
He was able to place the different types into a
chronological sequence . Once a good
typological sequence for an area is established
it can be referred to when new finds and sites
are discovered and used to ‘ cross-date ’ them .

In addition to design , the fabric or material
used to make the artefact is also analysed . 
If you take a piece of pottery into your local
museum , typology will be used to assign your
sherd to a particular period . 
Successive groups of contemporary artefacts , 
which are commonly found together ( known as
assemblages )  , have been used to form culture
sequences over wide periods . Before the advent
of absolute dating techniques this technique
enabled a timetable of the spread of ‘ cultures ’ 
across Europe in later prehistory to be
constructed , based on changing combinations
of grave goods . 
Seriation
Most artefact styles appear rarely at first in the
archaeological record , then become more
common and eventually dwindle in numbers
again . This pattern has enabled a sophisticated
statistical technique known as seriation 
( ordering ) to be used . The frequency with
which each form of artefact appears can be
plotted as bars on a timeline . Ideally this will
produce a shape known as a ‘ battleship curve ’ 
because it looks like an aerial view of a
battleship . The changing popularity of each
form will appear as a sequence of battleship
curves . Other sites can be dated relative to the
first site by comparing their seriation . 
Problems with these techniques
■ Although they can put sites and artefacts
into order , they can only be used to provide
calendar dates where elements of the
sequences are tied to historical data .

■ The introduction of radiocarbon dating
showed that archaeologists had underestimated timespans in prehistory and also
constructed sequences which fitted their
assumptions that all developments happened
around the Mediterranean and then spread
north and west to the ‘ less civilised ’ areas . 
■ One type of artefact doesn ’ t always succeed
another . For many years it was thought that
pointed hand axes were earlier than oval
ones after they were found in lower levels
on some sites . However , at Boxgrove both
were found together suggesting that other
influences on choice were important .

Figure 4 . 4 How to read a pollen dating diagram
■ Curation , the preservation of valued
artefacts , can lead to items being deposited
a long time after their manufacture . Basing
dates on a few isolated artefacts could lead
to errors . 
Geoarchaeological dating
For early periods of prehistory archaeologists
have borrowed techniques from the earth
sciences to reconstruct the environments of
early people and also to establish a relative
chronology based on environmental changes . 
As the climate altered , so too did the types and
relative numbers of different plants and
animals . Where organic preservation is good , 
changes can be traced by analysing pollen 
( palynology ) contained in sediments and animal
bones . To provide a pollen sequence a core
through a deposit such as peat is taken and for
each layer the proportions of different types of
pollen are identified . Sites within these deposits
can then be cross-dated to particular phases of
climate history in local sequences . Analysis has
to take account of many factors including the
different amounts of pollen produced by each
plant and the different distances the pollen
travels . Similarly , sites can be relatively dated
from the type of animal bones present . This is
particularly useful where the sequence of the
appearance or extinction of species ( for
example mammoths ) is known . Absolute
techniques are needed to date these sequences . 
Obsidian hydration
Obsidian is a volcanic glass that can be worked
to provide razor-sharp cutting edges . In the
Middle East and Mesoamerica it performed a
similar function to flint in northern Europe . 
As soon as a piece of obsidian is broken it
begins to absorb water from the atmosphere at 
a known rate ( in much the same way as a stick
of rock which goes soft on the outside )  . By
measuring how far water has penetrated into 
the obsidian ( hydration ) on one site a relative
date can be estimated compared to other sites . 
In some cases , obsidian can be calibrated to
provide absolute dates but that requires considerable additional data since the speed of hydration varies with local temperatures and the
chemical make-up of the obsidian . This is one 
of the cheaper laboratory dating techniques .

Figure 4 . 5 How obsidian hydration works
Chemical dating of bones
Buried bones absorb fluorine and uranium
from water in the ground whilst their nitrogen
content declines as collagen in the bones
decays . These processes occur at a uniform rate
so it is possible to establish the relative age of
different bones by measuring the proportions
of these chemicals . 
ABSOLUTE OR CHRONOMETRIC DATING
Since the middle of the twentieth century new
methods have been used to provide calendar
dates . With the exception of dendrochronology , 
they all have margins of error and are
expensive to use . 
Dendrochronology ( tree ring dating ) 
This is the most accurate chronometric dating
method . Every year trees produce a ring of
new wood under their bark . The rings are
wider in good conditions than in poor ones
and can provide a record of local climatic
variation . Trees in the same area will have
similar ring patterns which means wood from
different periods can be matched in overlapping
sequences . These are tied to historical dates by
modern trees . Californian Bristlecone Pines , 
which live for 4 , 000 years , were used to
construct sequences over 7 , 000 years in the
USA while oaks preserved in bogs have been
used in Europe to take sequences back nearly
10 , 000 years . The Sweet Track , a Neolithic
pathway across marshland in Somerset , 
included wood with the bark attached .

Figure 4 . 6 The key principles of dendrochronology
Dendrochronology established that the trees
used to build it were felled in the winter of
3807–3806 BC . However , the method has
limitations . Not all areas have sufficiently
varied seasons or enough surviving timber to
be able to construct sequences . To effectively
date wood around fifty years of tree rings are
needed . Since this represents quite a thick piece
of wood , the technique is better for dating
building timbers than artefacts . Its direct use is
from the Neolithic onwards when buildings
were used and it has been widely used on
medieval ships and buildings . 
Dendrochronology actually dates when the tree
died or was felled . Where wood has been
reused , as often happened with structural
timbers in the past , this method can overestimate the age of a structure . However , 
dendrochronology is also the key method for
calibrating radiocarbon dates ( see below ) and
therefore is indirectly used in dating a wide
range of organic materials for up to 11 , 500
years . 

A-C / ap / dendro / dendro . html

Radiocarbon dating
All living things absorb several types of carbon
isotope from the atmosphere in similar ratios . 
About 1 per cent of this carbon is an unstable
isotope known as carbon 14 ( C-14 ) which
decays at a known rate . By comparing the
weight of remaining C-14 with amounts of
other carbon isotopes in organic samples it is
possible to work out how much C-14 has
decayed . This indicates how long it has been
since decay began ( and the creature or plant
was alive )  . It was thought that the dates
produced by radiocarbon dating were precise
until it was recognised that amounts of carbon
in the atmosphere have varied over time . This
had led to underestimating the age of
prehistoric sites by up to 800 years . To get
round this problem , radiocarbon dates are
calibrated . 
Radiocarbon dates are never exact . Even after
calibration there is a margin of error that is
calculated statistically . This usually means that
there is a 68 per cent chance or ‘ level of
confidence ’  ( LOC ) that the real date is within
the range indicated and a 95 per cent LOC that
it is within twice the range . C-14 is mainly
used to date organic materials including bone , 
shell and plant remains . It does not work on
cremated bone although it will work for
charred bone . It is more precise with wood
samples from twigs and nuts than from trees
that may have lived for hundreds of years . 
Radiocarbon ’ s practical use is for periods from
200 to about 10 , 000 years with less reliability
to around 40 , 000 years . Until recently at least
10 grams of charcoal or 200 grams of bone
were needed for results . However , development
of a process known as accelerator mass
spectrometry ( AMS ) has enabled much smaller
samples of material to be dated , down to the
one grain of cereal . Great care has to be taken
with samples to avoid contamination . 


C-14 dates are expressed in the following ways : 
■ Lower case letters are often , but not always , 
used to show that dates are uncalibrated , 
whereas capitals should mean they have
86 ■ ARCHAEOLOGY COURSEBOOK
been calibrated . Increasingly ‘ Cal ’ is added
to a calibrated date to avoid any confusion . 
■ Calendar dates are expressed as ad or bc 
( uncalibrated ) and BC , AD , Cal BC , Cal AD 
( calibrated ) 
■ Radiocarbon dates are expressed as BP or
Cal BP ( calibrated )  . BP means ‘ before
present ’  ( 1950 ) and is often preferred for
early prehistoric periods for which BC and
AD are relatively meaningless . 
Thermoluminescence ( TL ) 
Radioactive decay in the quartz crystals found
in clay leads to a build up of electric charge at
a known rate . The electrical charge is released
as light when the crystals are heated . When
pottery is heated in a laboratory the energy in
the flash of light is measured and used to
calculate the time since it was fired . The
technique can be used for materials such as
glass and burnt flint or stone for periods from

less accurate than C-14 dating and can give
false readings due to radiation from the soil or
if the initial firing was at low temperature . 
However , it is useful for older periods and
instances where there are no organic remains
such as dating Upper Palaeolithic figurines . 

Potassium–argon dating
As potassium in rock crystals decays it
produces argon gas at a known rate . Measuring
the amounts and ratios in a laboratory provides
a date at which the crystal was formed . It has
been used in volcanic regions to date layers of
rock which sandwich human remains . For
instance , at Koobi Fora in East Africa early
hominid remains were dated to 1 . 89 million
years BP ±0 . 01 million years . The technique can

Calibration
Calibration involves turning measures of time into calendar dates by comparing results from
one method with dates from a more precise method . Dendrochronology is the most widely used
method for calibration . Essentially , wood of a known age is tested for its C-14 date and the
two dates compared . Once a large range of comparisons has been made a chart can be
produced which enables scientists to read off a calendar year against a sample date .

in detail although you should be aware of the
situations where they might be used . Like
radiocarbon dating , most of them rely on data
showing known rates of chemical change or
decay that can be measured in laboratories . 
Several of them measure the age of layers
rather than the human deposits themselves and
are thus limited to particular types of geology .

How it works
The chemical structures of the amino acids
found in all living things change slowly over
time at a known rate
The earth ’ s magnetic field changes over
time . When iron oxide is heated to around
600 °C and cools , it records the magnetic
field at that time . Variations in the earth ’ s
field have been calculated which enables
the date of initial heating to be established
Electrical charges build up at a known rate
in some crystal structures . The time since the
process began can be calculated by
measuring the charge
Uranium decays regularly through fission 
( splitting ) which releases energy and
damages crystalline structures , leaving a 
 ‘ track ’  . Tracks or holes are counted to estimate
the time the process of decay has taken
Uranium isotopes U235 and U238 are
soluble in water and decay to produce
deposits of thorium and protactinium at
known rates . By measuring the ratios of the
elements the date at which the deposits was
laid down can be established
Melt-water from glaciers lays down different
sediment at different times of year . This
creates annual layers like tree rings . 
Changing climate will lead to changing
deposits which can then be cross-referenced
over large areas

As humans , we use ideas and models to
interpret the world around us . It is impossible
to describe something or another person
without likening them to something or
somebody else . The same is true for
archaeology . The goal of archaeology is to
explain ( not really reconstruct ) past behaviour , 
but archaeologists do not dig up behaviour . 
They excavate material remains from the past
and assume that behaviour and the ideas that
motivated behaviour will be reflected in these
remains . They then use theories from the
present to make sense of the archaeological
record . For example , you need theory to
interpret a dark circular mark as a posthole or a
particular burial as that of a chieftain . This way
of thinking , which links material remains to
their interpretation as evidence , is known as
middle-range theory . 
Debates between archaeologists often stem
from differences in their assumptions about
how the archaeological record was created and
how one should interpret it . On degree-level
programmes you will encounter a variety of
theories of archaeological knowledge . Below

KEY CONCEPT
Archaeological theories of knowledge
There are a wealth of texts on this subject
and on the debates between rival schools
of thought . In recent years , as in most
academic disciplines , relativist ideas have
become very influential . They share a belief
that there are no absolute facts since all
knowledge is subjective . For example , the
values and assumptions we have determine
the way we think . The way we think
structures what we see in such a way that
it makes sense to us . When we think we
are discovering patterns in archaeological
data , what we are really doing is
organising data so that it reflects the
structures already in our minds . For
example , a female skeleton in a prehistoric
burial with a flint arrowhead by her neck
might be automatically interpreted as a
victim if you have already assumed that
only men fired arrows . Archaeologists with
other assumptions might see her as a
hunter or warrior . 
Figure 5 . 1 Excavation of this dark circle of
earth can define shape , dimensions and content . 
Establishing what it once was will always
require interpretation . This example was a lime
kiln
Figure 5 . 2 This stone built feature at
Empingham was identified as a corn dryer
through reference to other sites , ethnographic
example and experiment
recover it leads to variability in the overall
record . In order to interpret data , archaeologists have to know which materials go
together and can be used to provide evidence
of past behaviour . For example , a clustering of
broken pottery , burnt stones and processed
animal bones could represent a cooking area or
it could be the result of people spreading their
domestic rubbish on a field as fertiliser . This is
where archaeology becomes detective work . 
To determine which explanation is most likely
to be correct we need to understand the
processes by which data reached us . Sometimes
these are referred to as ‘ taphonomic processes ’ 
although it may be more useful to understand
them as several stages . 
TRANSFORMATION PROCESSES
These processes include all the stages by which
human behaviour from the past is translated
into the data recorded in archaeological reports
and all the human and natural forces that
shaped that data . 
Formation processes
Archaeological data can be used to explain past
human behaviour because people helped create
that data . Although ecofacts may be an
exception , this assumption is generally a good
one . The formation of archaeological materials
is a complex process involving four broad
stages . These need to be understood since
evidence can enter the archaeological record at
any point . A flint tipped arrow provides an
example in Figure 5 . 3 .

KEY TASK
Understanding formation processes
Produce your own table or diagram to
show your understanding of formation
processes using one of the following
examples : 
1 Remains of a hunted animal
2 A Roman amphora
Depositional processes are the ways in which
remains actually find their way into the
ground . If humans are responsible , we need to
try and understand their logic . Why was an
artefact discarded rather than being reused , 
recycled , repaired or curated ? These questions
also apply to structures . 
Some historical sources were created specifically to deceive . While there have been odd
instances of faking such as ‘ Piltdown Man ’  , it 
is highly unlikely that archaeological material
has been buried to fool later generations . 
However , there are still codes to be broken . 
Archaeologists carefully map buried finds to
see if there are patterns . Where these exist they
may indicate structured deposition which could
be helpful in understanding behaviour or
beliefs . Natural forces may also have caused
particular deposits . These might include
erosion , flooding or volcanic activity . By
understanding formation and transformation
processes , archaeologists learn to differentiate
between what was due to humans and what
was due to nature . 
Post-depositional factors
Once buried , further modifications take place . 
The archaeological record is not a safe place for
artefacts or ecofacts . The causes of these
changes are usually grouped as : 
■ natural forces or ‘ N factors ,  ’ including
bacteria , acid , water , erosion , ice , worms , 
sunlight , roots , freezing and thawing , 
drying out ( desiccation )  , silting , gnawing
and oxidisation
■ human or cultural ‘ C Factors ,  ’ including
grave robbing , looting , shelling , mining , 
reuse , ploughing , collecting , trampling , 
building and draining . 
These factors can result in changes including
movement , destruction , partial decay , colour
loss , texture and shape changes , and alteration
of chemical composition . The extent of change
varies between different materials . Inorganic
materials are preserved best . Stone , pottery and
bronze , for example , are particularly durable . 
Consequently , there is a systematic bias in the
96 ■ ARCHAEOLOGY COURSEBOOK
KEY TERM
Curation
Deliberately keeping and preserving
something . It accounts for why finds
sometimes turn up amid much more recent
collections of finds . Artefacts might be
curated for sentimental reasons , rarity , 
beauty or because they were particularly
useful . What has been curated in your
home ? Curation can distort the record , for
example in early medieval Europe classical
pottery often continued in use while metal
vessels were recycled . 
KEY TERM
Structured deposition
Most human societies , including our own , 
dispose of materials in ways determined by
their beliefs and knowledge . By trying to
uncover the patterns in which material was
deliberately deposited in the past , archaeologists hope to reveal elements of past
beliefs . Structured deposition has been
particularly influential in recent studies of
ritual practices in European prehistory , for
example at Flag Fen ( see p . 151 )  . 
archaeological record towards tools made from
these materials . By contrast , organic materials
such as wool , wood and bodies are far less
likely to survive . Taphonomy ( the law of
burial ) is the name commonly given to the
study of the effects of such processes on animal
and plant remains . The size of buried objects ; 
their depth of burial , climate and the nature of
the soil further complicate these basic
distinctions . Bones , for example , survive better
in neutral or alkaline soils than in acidic ones . 
They will decay more slowly than normal in

We can get some idea of the wealth of material
that is usually lost by studying excavations
from sites with exceptionally good organic
preservation . In these cases remains are
protected from the bacteria which normally
consume organic material by climatic
conditions or low oxygen levels ( anaerobic
conditions )  . While these sites remind us that
absence of evidence is not evidence of absence , 
we cannot assume that they are typical sites
from their period . 
■ Arid sites , often in desert regions , can lead
to remains drying out ( desiccation ) before
they have a chance to decay . In the case of
bodies , this process creates natural
mummies . Classic examples include Mesa
Verde in the south-west USA where
wooden and leather items were preserved . 
■ Waterlogged sites including lakes and peat
bogs have been particularly important in
European archaeology . Good examples
include Flag Fen , Tybrind Vig in Denmark
and the wreck of the Mary Rose . 
■ Frozen sites have produced some incredible
finds in recent years . Perhaps the most well

in peat but began to decay once exposed to the atmosphere . Considerable expense is required to conserve
and present them
known are the bodies of Otzi the Ice Man
from the Alps and the Pazyryk ‘ Ice Maiden ’ 
from Mongolia . Their skin has been so well
preserved that tattoos and acupuncture
marks can be studied . 
■ Rapidly buried sites can also reveal much
that is normally lost . The most famous
cases are those buried by volcanic ash such
as Pompeii , but mudslides such as at Ozette
in the USA also preserve organic material . 
Recovery factors
As if these processes were not enough , there is
one final hurdle for archaeological remains to
cross before they can be used to explain the
past . Archaeologists themselves structure the
archaeological record in the way they recover
data , the results in some materials or sites being
better represented than others . Sometimes this
may simply be due to chance factors such as
discovery or whether archaeologists can get
access to particular sites . Once on sites they
then decide whether to excavate everything or
to sample . Recovery also reflects their values . 
Decisions are sometimes made to prioritise
certain evidence over others . For example , 
excavators may dig through medieval deposits
in order to concentrate on Roman layers . 
Similarly , while pottery and metals finds are
usually recorded , animal bone is sometimes
not . The techniques available for recovery are
also important . Not all excavations will use
flotation techniques to recover pollen and small
bone fragments or have the laboratory support
to analyse them . Finally there is the quality of
the diggers and those recording the finds . 
Inevitably there are some variations . Once
away from the site , the care taken in analysis
and storage may continue to transform the
record . 
The net result of all these processes is that
archaeologists do not simply piece together
recorded data to produce a picture of the past . 
Archaeological evidence cannot speak for itself
and needs interpretation . Whatever was
deposited was a fraction of the material in use
by people in the past . Only some elements of
this will survive and only a sample of them will
be recovered . By understanding transformation
processes , archaeologists gain insights into what
shaped the various samples . This enables them
to identify which of the patterns in their data
are really the result of human behaviour and to
begin interpreting them . For example , human
skeletons are often found with the head turned
to one side . At face value this might seem
significant . However , forensic science has
revealed that the slumping of corpses ’ heads is
due to natural processes of decay rather than
burial rites . 
Partly because of the poor or variable quality
of data and the limitations of our analytical
techniques , archaeological reports often contain
minimal amounts of interpretation . Their
writers follow a scientific tradition of reporting
their findings and analysis of data but leaving
interpretation to others .

ARCHAEOLOGICAL INTERPRETATION ■ 99
KEY TASK
Group activity on transformation
processes
Brainstorm ideas about what might be left
for future generations of archaeologists if
a disaster struck your class today . Consider
what the effect of post-depositional forces
would be . Present your findings in a visual
format . 
Analysing spatial patterns
Having identified archaeological material and
taken account of various transformation
processes , archaeologists try to identify what
human behaviour lies behind any patterns that
they can detect . Initially this involves plotting
vertical and horizontal relationships between
finds , structures and sites . Patterning is taken
to be evidence for behaviour . For example , a
scatter of flint tools amidst the bones of an
animal might indicate a butchery or kill site
involving humans in scavenging or hunting . 
The toolkit used is termed a sub-assemblage . 
MAKING SENSE OF THE DATA
The next stage of archaeological interpretation
tends to vary according to the ideas about
knowledge held by the archaeologist . In most
cases they will use analogies or models to
formulate theories about what the data is
evidence of . 
Our society does not include all the rich
variety of human activity and culture that has
existed . To rely on it as the sole source of
analogies would be limiting and lead to
Eurocentric and anachronistic interpretations . 
Increasingly , archaeologists have drawn on
three major sources of analogies . 
Historical accounts or documents of 
past societies
■ Classical accounts of the world such as the
descriptions of Ancient Egypt by
Herodotus
■ Literary and artistic sources such as the
poetry of early medieval Europe
■ Travelogues written by the first western
people to visit areas largely unaffected by
European culture , for example , reports by
Catholic missionaries on the peoples of
Mesoamerica in the sixteenth century . 
These accounts are often called ethnohistories
100 ■ ARCHAEOLOGY COURSEBOOK
KEY TERM
Assemblage
Sub-assemblage : a repeated pattern of
artefacts associated with one activity . 
Think of it as a toolkit . 
Assemblage : the range of toolkits used by
a particular community . 
KEY TERM
Analogy
This involves using something with which
we are familiar to interpret a new thing or
phenomena . It is based on the idea that if
two things are similar in one way then they
may be similar in others . When we describe
an artefact as a hand-axe or an enclosure
as a hill fort , we are using analogies . 
Analogies range from interpretations of
how something was made or worn to what
the social systems or patterns of religious
belief in the past might have been . 
Analogies cannot prove anything about the
past but they can tell us much about what
was possible . They can widen our horizons , 
generate new lines of enquiry and provide
theories to be tested against further
evidence to see how robust they are . 
■ Where there is continuity in population , 
environment and some cultural forms , the
direct historical approach ( DHA ) uses
studies of , or oral accounts from , current
peoples . For example , Flannery and Marcus
used DHA to form a hypothesis about the
nature of pre-Hispanic religious beliefs and
ceremonies in Mesoamerica . 
Historical sources have been used particularly
to flesh out the social aspects of past cultures . 
They have also been used to identify or
interpret specific sites such as Tintagel or to
explain why particular patterns of deposition
might occur . Up until recently , historical
sources were accorded far more weight than
archaeological sources in writing the history of
past societies . However , there are many
problems with these sources . We don ’ t know
whether the writers had correctly identified
features of the societies they describe or if our
understanding of concepts is the same as that
of the writers . 
Ethnography or anthropology
Ethnography is the study of people in the
world today while anthropology compares
cultures to identify general principles . Amongst
the most well known studies are those of the
Hadza and Kalahari bushmen which were used
in the 1960s to provide social and economic
models for pre-agricultural people in Europe as 
 ‘ man the hunter ’  . 
■ Specific analogies have been used to explore
particular archaeological phenomena . 
Several archaeologists have used examples
of mortuary rituals from around the world
to help interpret prehistoric sites ( see 
p . 146 )  . 
■ General models drawing on broad
comparisons across many cultures such as
Service ’ s band-tribe-chiefdom model of
social evolution ( see p . 238 ) have been
used to categorise and describe past
societies . 
However , most anthropological studies come
from the twentieth century when most of the
world was influenced in some way by European civilisations . There is often also a huge
gulf in time and place between ancient peoples
and the modern groups who are the source 
of analogies . While taking us beyond western
models , ethnography can also limit our
imagination . It is highly likely that ideas , social
organisations and ways of doing things existed
in the past that are not present in any current
societies . The greater share of variation in
human societies has already been lost . Archaeologists also have to resist the temptation to
select the single examples that make most sense
to them .

ARCHAEOLOGICAL INTERPRETATION ■ 101
KEY STUDY
Iron Age Britain
Typical accounts of Britain in the first
millennium draw heavily on Roman sources
to interpret archaeological remains . The
stereotypical view is of a warlike ‘ Celtic ’ 
society ruled over by chieftains who
controlled trade and agricultural surpluses . 
This has recently been undermined by
research that suggests that Iron Age
society was more varied and less stratified . 
Archaeological data provides more
evidence of productive farmers than
warriors and has led archaeologists such
as Hill ( 1996 ) to challenge the ideas of
chiefs , Celts and hill forts ( see p . 180 )  . 
Actualistic studies
These studies involve the use of materials
similar to those from the past in order to tie
observed behaviour to physical remains . 
Ethnoarchaeology
This involves studying how contemporary
communities use material culture from an
archaeological perspective . By correlating
modern activities with physical remains we
may start to understand what behaviour is
reflected in which data . Studying people who
manufacture stone tools and the debris they
leave can help us identify the signatures left by
different processes . Examining the distribution
of remains within modern hunting camps may
help identify the functions of particular areas 
( see p . 167 )  . Ethnoarchaeology may also
help reveal ‘ invisible ’ influences such as gender
or ethnicity . 
Experimental Archaeology
This involves forming a hypothesis about a
process , artefact or ecofact and testing it using
similar materials to those found on archaeological sites . 
■ Using replica artefacts to discover their
functions . For example , testing flint axes to
see how effectively they can chop down
trees and then comparing the wear patterns
with Neolithic examples . 
■ Reconstructions use data as the basis for
models that can be tested . The best known
in Britain is probably the constructs of Iron
Age roundhouses at Butser Ancient Farm . 
Some studies have gone further , for example
Plymouth Plantation in the USA where
participants attempt to recreate activities
from the past . Where the remains of an
experimental village are examined there
might be an overlap with ethnoarchaeology . 
However , the people in the experiment
would clearly be very different from those
in archaeological examples . 
■ Recreating taphonomic and other transformation processes to understand patterns on
real sites . Experiments in Africa have
explored the effect of scavengers on the
distribution of bones from a carcass or the
effects of streams on artefact movement .

WHY DO ARCHAEOLOGISTS OFFER
DIFFERENT INTERPRETATIONS OF 
THE PAST ? 
Since archaeologists disagree about how or
whether past behaviour can be reconstructed
and because the archaeological record is so
flawed , it is hardly surprising that their
accounts differ . Data is constantly being
reinterpreted as archaeologists ask new
questions , use new techniques or find new
sources of analogy . They also borrow models
and methods from other disciplines . In the
1970s geography provided settlement
archaeology with site catchment analysis and
central place theory . In the 1990s phenomenology and critical theory inspired new
interpretations of beliefs and rituals . The
continued debate amongst archaeologists is a
sign of the subject ’ s vitality . 
104 ■ ARCHAEOLOGY COURSEBOOK
KEY SKILL
Applying your understanding to your course
Having an appreciation of how the archaeological record is formed should help you to
understand archaeological reports and arguments . A grasp of why archaeologists ’ arguments
might differ is necessary to score well on essays which ask you to evaluate a point of view . This
is important at A2 and crucial at undergraduate level . 
To practise , try to explore a debate between two writers who disagree about a topic you are
studying . You may like to work with another student on this to halve the reading . 
Start by writing down clearly what it is that they disagree about . Then , for each text list the
key points that make up their argument and the key evidence they cite in support of each
point . Try to identify where they are making an interpretation . 
You will probably find that they will either : 
■ be using different data which will produce conflicting results
■ differ about what the archaeological record actually shows or
■ use different analogies to interpret data . 
Your task is to explain the difference and then reach a conclusion about which of the
explanations you consider more valid . For example , you could argue that some data is better
than others for the particular question in hand or you could consult other sources to see which
side they tend to support . 
Present your findings briefly in bullet point form on a divided side of A4 paper . Add a visual
symbol to each half to help you remember them . 
Examples of debates : 
Binford vs . Freeman over whether
there were elephant hunters at
Torralba ( Binford 1989 ) 
Cunliffe ( 1995 ) vs . Hill ( 1996 ) on
whether Celtic chieftains ruled during
the Iron Age in Britain
THREATS TO ARCHAEOLOGICAL
REMAINS
Natural processes ( see Chapter 5 ) account for
the decay of most archaeological remains once
in the soil but the overwhelming threat to
surviving monuments , from field systems to
buildings , comes from human activity . The
rapid growth of towns and road networks since
1945 combined with more declining pasture
land and more intensive forms of agriculture
are largely responsible . 
Since the 1960s most excavation has been of
sites which were about to be destroyed through
development . Despite the efforts of some
government agencies , many volunteer groups
and the charity Rescue , only a small proportion
were recorded . This was the key factor behind
the introduction of the government policy and
planning guide PPG 16 ( see p . 111 )  . 
In Britain recent debates about the destruction
of archaeology have focused on peat extraction , 
the Channel Tunnel rail link and various road
schemes . One of the most controversial is at
Stonehenge and all sides of the debate can be
researched at the websites below .

Managing 
the Past
Chapter 6
YOUR GOALS
You need to understand
■ the key threats to our archaeological heritage
■ the nature and effectiveness of current protection for archaeological remains
■ the roles of the key agencies involved in archaeology and managing heritage
■ the key debates about the preservation and ownership of archaeological remains . 
Some high profile sites are simply threatened
by increasing public interest in our past . 
Hadrian ’ s Wall and Avebury are two high
profile sites that have suffered badly from
erosion caused by walkers . As World Heritage
Sites ( see p . 110 ) detailed management plans
have been drawn up to try and resolve the
conflict between access and preservation . 
Avebury ’ s plan can be found at :

knowledge / archaeology / new-archcommis / 
archcommis9697 / 1 . html
Naturally public attention focuses on threats to
known monuments and exciting discoveries . 
However , a massive amount of our visible
archaeological heritage has disappeared in the
last fifty years with little protest . A glance at
local aerial photographs from the 1940s will
reveal how many hedges , water meadows and
medieval field systems have vanished . To the
landscape archaeologist they provide key
evidence about landownership , settlement and
use of the environment . Medieval field systems
also provided a protective blanket over earlier
sites that would otherwise have been eroded . 
Global threats to archaeology
With the pace of development across the globe , 
huge numbers of archaeological sites are lost
each year . Few countries have the resources to
record what is lost and , for many , archaeology

MANAGING THE PAST ■ 107
KEY STUDY
The Monuments at Risk Survey of England ( MARS )  , 1995
Bournemouth University and The Royal Commission on the Historic Monuments of England 
( RCHME ) combined to survey the condition of a 5 per cent random sample of England ’ s
937 , 484 recorded archaeological sites . The study , which was funded and published by English
Heritage , provides a census of the nature , distribution and state of England ’ s archaeological
resources . 
The study discovered that the South-east had lost the highest proportions of monuments with
best survival in the West Midlands . Standing buildings and field systems are most at risk while
those protected by legislation are at least risk . In total , 95 per cent of monuments had
suffered some damage . Since 1945 an average of one site a day has been destroyed . Around 
2 per cent of recorded sites will have been lost since the survey . The table below summarises
the key causes of destruction . 
MARS drew on existing records plus its own surveys but inevitably will have missed many
buried sites . The numbers of all sites destroyed and at risk will be higher .

Figure 6 . 2 Key causes of destruction to archaeological remains . From the MARS Report
comes an understandable second to feeding and
housing their people . An additional global
problem is the looting of archaeological sites to
feed the demand of western collectors for
artefacts and artwork . Britain has its problems
with ‘ nighthawks ’  ( see p . 116 ) but looting in
much of the world is on an industrial scale . At
Angkor Wat and other Buddhist temples in
Cambodia , power tools have been used to
remove statues and reliefs which are then
trucked over the border for export . In the west , 
the blame is often placed with corrupt local
officials and the army for colluding or even
controlling the trade . The Cambodian
government has responded by blaming famous
auction houses in London for disposing of

bought by wealthy ‘ art collectors ’ in the west
stolen antiquities . On a much lower scale sites
throughout the world are routinely looted for
coins , pottery and other portable artefacts by
local people . They supplement low incomes by
selling to tourists and dealers . Sometimes
monuments are deliberately destroyed as has
happened recently in Bosnia and Afghanistan .

THE PROTECTION OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL
REMAINS
Archaeology has not been well served in terms
of legal protection . Nevertheless some
protection has been provided in legislation
since 1882 . Some of the following laws only
apply to England . There are similar laws for
other parts of the UK . 
Ancient Monuments and Archaeological
Areas Act 1979 ( AMAA ) 
Legislation before 1979 provided little
protection . Even owners of scheduled
monuments simply had to give notice if they
wanted to change their condition . AMAA
replaced previous laws and provided greater
protection . Its key features are : 
■ the consent of the Secretary of State is
required before any changes to scheduled
monuments ( listed by English Heritage as
being of national importance ) can be made
■ English Heritage has the task of recording , 
assessing and monitoring monuments . It can
recommend endangered sites and the land
around them for scheduling to the Secretary
of State for Culture , Media and Sport 
/ 
■ Part 2 of the Act allowed Areas of
Archaeological Importance to be designated
where development could be delayed for
proper assessment and excavation ( paid
from government funds ) 
■ the National Heritage Act ( 1983 ) amended
AMAA to also include works , gardens and 
 ‘ areas ’ as Monuments . 
Pros
■ It gave legal protection to some visible
monuments after years of destruction . 
■ The English Heritage monument protection
programme is listing other key monuments . 
Currently about 15 , 000 are listed ( only 2
per cent of known archaeological sites )  . 
■ Part 2 established the use of mapping as a
tool to protect sites by warning developers
of sites where their plans might be slowed
down or halted . 
■ Some landowners have accepted funding
and signed management agreements to
protect sites . 
Cons
■ Sites which are not scheduled as being ‘ of
national importance ’  ( around 98 per cent of
known sites ) are not protected . 
■ Newly discovered sites are not protected , so
these can be lost in development . The
process of scheduling is slow ( for example
only 40 of 40 , 000 known shipwrecks are
scheduled )  . 
■ It doesn ’ t cover landscapes . 
■ It often protects a visible monument but
leaves hidden , related features at risk of
further damage . Many barrows survive as
tiny islands in ploughed fields . This is
vividly illustrated at the Knowlton Henge
site .

■ Landowners and developers can appeal and
can also plead ignorance as an excuse for
damaging sites . 
■ Few towns had areas of archaeological
importance designated . The second part of
the Act was never brought properly into
force . 
■ The cost of work fell on local or national
government , which did not always see this
work as a priority ! 
■ Ploughing of monuments can continue as
long as the depth of ploughing isn ’ t
increased . 
Other protective legislation for sites
Most of these laws were not drawn up with
archaeology in mind , however they do provide
some protection for unscheduled sites including
archaeological landscapes . 
■ The National Parks Act 1949 limited
development within the parks and
designated other ‘ Areas of Outstanding
Natural Beauty ’  . MARS found that survival
in these areas was better than elsewhere . 
■ The Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981
required local authorities to assess rural
areas and draw up plans for their
management . Archaeology can be taken into
account . 
■ The Town and Country Planning Act 1971
allowed local authorities to take
Archaeology into account in planning
applications and required them to produce
structure plans for future development . 
Further legislation in 1990 created conservation areas . 
■ Capital Transfer Tax 1984 . Landowners are
exempted from this if they sign ( secret ) 
management agreements to maintain and
preserve the land and ensure reasonable
access . 
■ Additionally there are clauses on
archaeology in legislation on a number of
industries including coal mining and
electricity . There are also a growing number
of non-statutory categories of designation
such as Parks and Gardens and the
Battlefield Register . None of these provide
secure protection and none ensures funding
for archaeological work . 
International protection
The United Nations Educational , Scientific and
Cultural Organization ( UNESCO ) has drawn
up a World Heritage list of 630 sites of
outstanding international value . 
110 ■ ARCHAEOLOGY COURSEBOOK
KEY TASK
Group exercises assessing local
monuments
■ Visit a sample of local monuments to
try and assess the condition and
threats to them . You may be able to
obtain a list from your local SMR . 
Compare your findings to the MARS
study . 
■ Investigate what the impact of PPG 16
has been in your area . This could
involve interviews with some of those
involved and examination of the role of
local organisations such as units , SMR , 
etc . 
Either of these tasks would make a good
personal study project . 
Governments of most UN member states have
signed up to protect these sites . In itself this
provides some protection since it would be
embarrassing for a government to authorise
development on a listed site . The scheme also
enables funds to be channelled to conservation
and restoration projects on endangered sites in
poorer countries . However , it does not
guarantee preservation and only covers a
fraction of sites worldwide .

Countries vary widely in how they manage
archaeological resources . This chapter has
focused on England but Australia provides an
interesting alternative example :

PROTECTION OF ARTEFACTS
Legal protection of artefacts focuses on those
few examples of high monetary value . The old
laws on treasure trove in England and Wales
were replaced by the Treasure Act in 1996 . It
defines objects and coins as treasure which are
over 300 years old and either over ten per cent
precious metal or at least ten in number . Items
substantially composed of precious metal and
less than 300 years old are treasure if it can be
shown that they were deposited with the
intention of recovering them . 

1996024 . htm
www . finds . org . uk
Apart from general legislation on theft and
trespass , the law neglects other materials ( for
example pottery ) which may be of greater
archaeological value . In the case of treasure , it
also means that the archaeological
record / archive can be broken up . 
PROTECTION THROUGH THE PLANNING
PROCESS : PPG 16
Planning and Policy Guide note number 16 
( 1990 ) is not a law . It one of several guidelines
issued by the government to help local
planning officials in England when they
consider applications to develop land . Another
note , PPG 15 ( 1994 )  , deals with changes to
buildings of historic interest . However , while
PPG 16 is not law , planners need to have good
reasons for not following its advice . It advises
planners to consider archaeology at an early
stage of the development process and to favour
the preservation of archaeological remains
where possible . PPG 16 advises that the
developer should be responsible for funding
any archaeological work deemed necessary . It
also provides guidance on appeals that can be
made to the Secretary of State for the
Environment . 
PPG 16 broadly divides archaeologists into two
groups . 
Curators
Local authority ( LA ) archaeologists advise
planners on the sensitivity of each site , 
following a desktop survey ( see Chapter 1 ) 
drawing on information held by the LA Sites
and Monuments Record ( SMR )  . They will
draw up the brief for any archaeological work
needed and check that it is done to required
standards . Most of the finds from development
work are usually deposited with the LA
museum service .

Developers will put out a contract for

to competitive tender . They may also hire
archaeological consultants to contest the local
authority positions . Independent archaeological
trusts or commercial ‘ units ’ do most of this
work . LA units or amateur groups carry out
some work but this is becoming increasingly
rare . 

The effects of PPG 16
PPG 16 has had an enormous impact on
archaeology in England and there is considerable debate amongst archaeologists about its
positive and negative effects . To gain a taste of
the debate , look in the archives of the
archaeology email discussion group Britarch . 
britarch @ jiscmail . ac . uk
Key points include the following : 
Positive
■ The past is now recognised as a finite
resource , which requires management and
conservation . 
■ Rescue archaeology is funded by what
amounts to a tax on development . 
■ Archaeological remains are considered by
planners and those which are destroyed are
often ‘ preserved by record ’  . 
■ It provides increased employment for
professional archaeologists
■ It encourages the development of 
SMRs because of the need for detailed
records . 
Negative
■ Sites for excavation are dictated by
development rather than research needs . 
■ It results in decreasing opportunities for
amateur enthusiasts to become involved in
excavations ( see p . 116 )  . 
■ Archaeological units tended to price
themselves too low in bids during the early
1990s with the result that many struggle to
pay staff well . 
■ The costs of post-excavation work , 
including the use of specialists and storage
of remains , tends to be overlooked and may
have suffered . Some museums are now 
 ‘ full ’  . 
■ Excavation reports are the property of the
developers , who do not have to publish
them . 
■ Some local authorities have used PPG 16 as
a way of reducing funding for archaeology . 
LA archaeologists often spend most of their
time on planning matters . 
The language of PPG 16
PPG 16 has generated a new range of
terminology , which needs to be understood in
order to follow archaeologists ’ discussions : 
■ Archaeological assessment or appraisal : 
usually means a desktop survey and a look
at the site . 
■ Field evaluation : a survey of the site , which
usually includes trial trenching to establish
the depth , nature and condition of remains . 
■ Watching brief : literally that . An archaeologist will watch as the bulldozers go in to
see if any archaeological remains are
unearthed and to report on them . 
■ Preservation in situ : PPG 16 favours
preserving archaeological remains where
they are . This can mean putting a raft of
concrete over deposits or resting buildings

on piles driven through deposits . This
method is controversial . In Norway , piling , 
which damages and interferes with the
drainage and stratigraphy of sites , is viewed
as destruction rather than preservation . 
■ Preservation by record : the site is destroyed
but a proper archaeological record is made
through a detailed site report . 
Other forms of protection
The protection of archaeological remains is a
key aim of many of the organisations listed in
the next section . Official agencies such as
English Heritage or Historic Scotland have
statutory responsibilities and advise ministers
on policy and decisions affecting archaeology .  
/ 

Campaigns , including lobbying , use of the
media and advice for developers and farmers , 
are also part of the roles of independent
organisations , charities and learned bodies 
such as the Council for British Archaeology 
( CBA )  , Rescue and the Prehistoric Society . 
There is also the Institute of Field
Archaeologists which promotes ( but cannot
enforce ) high standards amongst those engaging
in excavations and acts as a professional body
for the sector .

WHO ARE THE ARCHAEOLOGISTS ? 
Within archaeology in the UK there is
increasing debate about who should engage 
in practical archaeology . Archaeology ’ s roots
lie with the work of enthusiastic amateurs 
but it has become increasingly professionalised . 
114 ■ ARCHAEOLOGY COURSEBOOK
Figure 6 . 6 Developer-led archaeology . This
major excavation in Cheltenham by the
Cotswold Archaeological Trust was the result of
a contract tendered by the developers as part of
planning permission for a new superstore . The
small team of professional archaeologists
dressed in safety gear and working to tight
deadlines at any time of year ( this was
January ) is the face of most modern
archaeology
Beginning with the antiquarians from the
seventeenth century onwards archaeology
provided a hobby for landed enthusiasts . This
continued until the 1950s . Some early diggers
were little more than grave robbers but by the
twentieth century other amateurs , such as Sir
Mortimer Wheeler , had pioneered modern
excavation techniques . 
Learned and excavation societies
By the late Victorian period most parts of the
country had societies devoted to gathering
archaeological information and communicating
it to their members and to the wider public . 
Most undertook excavations and began
journals , many of which continue to this day . 
Some even established museums where their
collections could be displayed . As before , it
was largely an upper-class activity , undertaken
by those who could afford the time to take part
in research excavations . The societies did , 
however , engage a wider spectrum of the public
by the 1950s . 
Rescue archaeology
The massive urban expansion and road building
programmes of the 1960s and 1970s saw a rapid
rise in rescue archaeology as teams of
volunteers or low paid diggers sought to record
what they could before bulldozers or ploughs
destroyed remains . This coincided with a rapid
expansion of higher education including the
development of new archaeological
departments . These developments provided
many new opportunities for the public to get
involved in archaeology and to follow that
interest academically . However , archaeology
was poorly resourced . Much of the funding
came from charitable efforts . It was difficult to
find full time paid work in archaeology but a
pool of skilled excavators did develop from
diggers who moved from site to site .

MANAGING THE PAST ■ 115
Figure 6 . 7 How it used to be : amateur involvement in archaeology . The Empingham excavation 
( see p . 30 ) involved a small number of professionals working alongside volunteers . Since the 1970s , 
amateurs have been gradually squeezed out of much excavation work by professionalisation and the
terms of developer contracts
Archaeology today
In the 1980s and 1990s archaeology underwent
major changes . Commercialisation came
initially thorough government funding for job
creation schemes run by the Manpower
Services Commission , then with PPG 16 it
largely came from developers . Opportunities
for amateurs to be involved in digging declined . 
Developers expected professional workers on
site and commercial health and safety
regulations to be applied . Also , the need for
recruits to spend their time earning a living
made it difficult to supervise or train
volunteers . Professionalisation was also marked
in the growth of member organisations such as
the Institute of Field Archaeologists , which set
standards for entry and provided a code of
conduct for members . Archaeology also
became more specialised . The application of
scientific techniques for prospecting , recording
and analysing was in most cases beyond the
resources of rescue committees and enthusiastic
amateurs . 
Most excavations now fall into the following
three categories : 
■ Assessments and rescue excavations in
advance of developments . These are largely
carried out by professional archaeologists in
the contracting units . 
■ Research excavations run by universities . 
These are largely open to their own
students although some take paying
volunteers as training excavations . 
■ Research excavation by specialists from
government heritage agencies . 
There are still amateur excavations but they are
much fewer and smaller scale than previously . 
The Council for Independent Archaeology
offers a forum for amateur archaeologists .  
. 
htm
More generally , amateurs are still able to take
part in supporting roles such as pot-washing
and fieldwalking but their opportunities to dig
and to develop expertise are greatly reduced . 
For criticisms of ‘ official archaeology ’ see : 

thinktank / who / welcome . htm
Metal detecting
The gradual exclusion of amateurs from field
archaeology has coincided with an increase in
metal detecting . Some professionals remain
hostile to all detectorists because of damage
that has been done to sites or looting by
organised gangs of ‘ nighthawks ’  . Increasingly
there are also commercial companies
advertising metal detecting tours . 

However , most detectorists are not
intentionally destructive or members of
criminal gangs but simply people interested in
the physical past . Increasingly there have been
moves by county archaeologists to work with
detectorists and some archaeologists do use
metal detectors on excavations . Issues can be
followed up at the CBA website .

KEY SKILL
Starting to construct arguments
Putting together arguments is a key element in higher level essay writing . One way to approach
this is to organise your notes into pro and con lists . Try this for the following question . It would
work equally well as a small group task . 
Outline the case for and against amateur involvement in excavation
Aim to write three sides of A4 . You might like to consider the following points as starters . 
■ Most archaeologists start out as amateurs . 
■ Professionals are ‘ better ’ than amateurs . 
■ Can standards be ensured without professionalism ? 
Tip
Writing pro and con assignments usually leads to one of the following structures . 
A is easier to write than B , but B ensures that you compare for and against on each point . A
can become descriptive while with B you have to be analytical . Whichever you select , try to
provide a range of points and support each with a specific example . If you only consider a few
points it is difficult to reach the higher levels of markschemes , however much detail you have
included . It is also vital that you say at the end how far you agree with the arguments for and
against . Don ’ t worry about what you conclude as long as it is supported by the judgements you
make in the body of the assignment . 
Alternative assignments : 
■ Consider the arguments for and against metal detecting . 
■ Consider the strengths of research archaeology against developer-led archaeology .

Key skills opportunities
The task above provides the opportunity to meet some national level 3 communication key
skills . By entering the table from the MARS report ( Figure 6 . 2 ) in a spreadsheet package such
as Excel you could present and interrogate the information in a variety of different formats to
meet ICT key skills at level 2 or 3 . 
WHICH PAST ? 
Before considering how archaeological remains
and knowledge might be best communicated it
is worth reflecting on what the social and
cultural implications of explanations about the
past might be . Archaeological knowledge and
the images of the past created by archaeologists
are not value free . As with history and
literature , the selection of what is significant
and how it should be interpreted partly derives
from the political and social values and
structures in present-day society . Archaeology
and history have in turn been used either
consciously or unconsciously to justify
present-day values and social structures . 
The political use of archaeology
Extreme cases are fairly easy to identify . Recent
centuries have seen a succession of rulers who
have sought to justify their regimes and their
territorial ambitions by claiming precedent
from the past . Mussolini , the Fascist dictator of
Italy ( 1922–45 ) claimed to be following in the
footsteps of the Romans with his plans to
establish an Italian empire in Africa and to turn
the Mediterranean into an Italian lake ( Mare
Nostrum )  . Saddam Hussein in Iraq has drawn
parallels between his regime and the ancient
civilisation of Babylon , which dominated the
region in the second millennium BC . Israel , 
Bosnia and the Indian city of Ayodhya are
three of many places where archaeology is

YOUR GOALS
You need to 
■ understand some of the political and ethical debates about ownership and presentation of
the past
■ have a knowledge of a range of methods of communicating archaeological understanding
■ know some case studies in depth to use as examples
■ be able to critically assess the merits of different modes of communication . 
involved in violent political conflicts . In each
case the ability to control what is known about
the past is used as a tool to legitimise political , 
social or economic power . 
However , it is not just dictatorships or
extremist political parties which have used
archaeology for political ends . Mainstream
politicians in many countries have argued over
the ownership of cultural remains . The most
famous of these is the dispute between Britain
and Greece over the Elgin Marbles . In many
parts of the world , native peoples are using
archaeology to reclaim rights lost in previous
centuries . In some cases this involves claims for
the return of cultural artefacts taken from them
by foreign museums or art collectors . 
Increasingly there are also disputes over the
disturbance of burials by archaeologists and for
the return of human remains to their place of
origin for burial . Usually at the heart of these
conflicts are two fundamental issues : 
■ Should ( usually western ) archaeologists
have the right to excavate cultural remains
of another culture or are their actions
simply a continuation of colonialist
exploitation ? 
■ Do excavated remains from the past provide
evidence which can be used to sustain
claims on the rightful ownership of land ? 
Archaeology and land rights
In South Africa during the colonial period , a
myth was created by Dutch settlers that they
had occupied an empty land . Archaeological
finds proved that to be false . In Australia , 
aboriginal groups have been able to use archaeological evidence to prove that their ancestors
inhabited particular regions and to demonstrate
their right to the land or to compensation for
its use by others . 
Archaeology and identity
In Britain , there are also political struggles
about rights and identity which involve
archaeology and assumption drawn from it . In
Wales , the selection of sites for preservation
and particularly for promotion has generated
debate about which version of the past should
predominate : the past of English conquest and
castle building or the tradition of Welsh
independence and resistance ? More generally , 
the way archaeologists have interpreted the
past can lead to certain values and
arrangements being seen as unchanging and
therefore ‘ normal ’  .

KEY STUDY
Nazi archaeology
Archaeology was enlisted for propaganda
purposes by the Nazi government of
Germany during the 1930s and 1940s . 
At this time it was commonplace for
archaeologists to associate pottery styles
with distinctive ethnic groups and to
identify racial differences from skeletal
remains . The Nazis used this confusion of
race with ethnicity to draw up racial maps
of Europe and identify ‘ superior ’ races . 
Their excavations ‘ revealed ’ artefacts of
Germanic origin in occupied Poland including some bowls marked with swastikas ! 
Overlooking the fact that the symbol itself
is an ancient Indian one , these forgeries
were given a scientific stamp of approval
and used to justify the Nazi conquests as
retaking land that was ‘ proven ’ to be
historically German . 
Until the late twentieth century , many archaeologists associated particular artefacts with
homogenous ethnic groups and attributed
social changes to the arrivals of new peoples , 
for example ‘ the beaker people ’  . This fitted
with the assumptions of many classically
educated people that social and technological
developments had originated in the
Mediterranean and then were spread by
colonists into the barbarian lands further north . 
It also fitted the way in which Europeans
viewed their empires in the rest of the world
122 ■ ARCHAEOLOGY COURSEBOOK
KEY STUDIES
Archaeology and Native Americans
According to historical records , the Pequot Indian tribe of Connecticut died out following a
war with European settlers in the seventeenth century . However , archaeologists working with
descendants of the Pequots were able to establish cultural continuity between the original tribe
and survivors of the war whose descendents continued to live on reservations in the area until
recent times . The Pequots were able to use archaeological data to gain recognition as a
sovereign nation from the US government in 1987 . A treaty was signed and some of their land
was returned to them . 
By the 1990s the civil rights movements for Native Americans had won a series of legal and
political victories . One of these was the 1990 Native American Graves Protection and
Repatriation Act ( NAGPRA ) which provides for the return to tribes of the skeletons and
religious artefacts of their ancestors . This has created problems for archaeologists . To some
Native Americans , archaeology is grave robbing by an occupying power . A major conflict has
arisen since the discovery of human remains at Kennewick on the Columbia River . Scientists
who examined the remains dated them to 8410 ± BP and claimed that the anatomy was
different from that of Native Americans .  ‘ Kennewick Man ’ quickly became a political issue . 
Native Americans wanted the remains to be reburied , not studied . Some feared that if he did
prove to be from a people who occupied the area before the current tribes , his existence might
be used to challenge the right of Native Americans to that land . Attempts to perform rituals
near the bones led to claims that their DNA was deliberately being contaminated . The US
Army then dumped rubble over the find-site but were unable to prevent the dispute spreading . 
For further details on this fascinating case try the following websites :  
 
 
( for the Native American perspective )  
 
( for the Archaeological Institute 
of America ’ s view ) 
and to some extent justified their role in
spreading ‘ civilisation ’ to inferior ‘ races ’  . 
Recent advances in archaeology and genetics
have undermined the idea that pure ethnic
groups existed in the past , while radiocarbon
dating has shown that indigenous Neolithic
and Bronze Age peoples had achieved a great
deal well before the arrival of Mediterranean
influences . The building of Stonehenge and the
brochs of Scotland and the Northern Isles 
( see p . 185 ) are two cases where the
achievements of indigenous populations are
now recognised . 
In a similar way , early archaeologists often
identified burials of male and female on the
basis of their assumptions about gender roles . 
For example , a skeleton buried with an axe
must have been male because men fight and
chop down trees , a burial with a mirror or
domestic artefacts must be female . A largely 
 ‘ female ’ burial with an arrowhead could be
explained away as a woman who had been
killed by the arrow . This kind of analysis has , 
in turn , tended to reinforce stereotypes about
natural roles for men and women . Once again , 
recent discoveries such as the Pazyryk ‘ Ice

Taking notes from contradictory sources
For longer questions , including essays , you will be expected to consider more than one side to
any given issue . In order to do this effectively and quickly , you need to become used to
understanding arguments . If you find this difficult you could try using this structured approach . 
Attempt it using the Kennewick websites as your raw material . 
For each point of view complete a table such as the one below . State as simply as you can the
general argument or claim . 
Having done this you may now be able to distinguish between the arguments . Are some of the

feel is unsound ? Is the difference one of belief or opinion for which you can only decide on a
moral basis ? You may find that the two parties agree on certain aspects or that you think they
are both sound in different ways . This is the kind of information you will need to write down

Some museums have begun to re-label displays

New Age and pagan beliefs and the issue of
access to ancient monuments
Most books on Stonehenge feature a picture of
the Druids , a nineteenth-century order who
developed their own ceremonies at the
monument based on their interpretation of
Iron Age beliefs . Since the 1960s other groups
have also sought to use ancient monuments for
rituals and festivals . In some cases people have
claimed the sites as sacred according to their 
beliefs and want the right to worship there . For
others their demands to hold parties at the sites
symbolise a struggle against an oppressive state . 
Either way , these demands have led to conflict
with those responsible for managing the
monuments and archaeologists concerned about
damage to remains . In the case of the West
Kennet Long Barrow this involves sarsen stone
being damaged by candles . In the case of
Stonehenge disputes over access have led to
public order offences and occasionally violence . 
There is plenty of material available on other
controversial sites including Mayburgh Henge
where there was a proposal to raise a Christian
millennium stone in 2000 .

Seahenge
In 1999 a Bronze Age timber monument was
discovered on eroding mudflats off the Norfolk
coast . Initially there was a very public dispute
between English Heritage , which felt it was not
worth saving from the sea , and archaeologists , 
who saw it as a unique and priceless ritual site . 
English Heritage reversed its decision and the
timbers were excavated and taken to Flag Fen
near Peterborough for conservation . This
provoked opposition from local people who
wanted the timbers to remain near where they
had been found , and from pagans who saw the
excavation of the site as sacrilege . The debate
continues and is extensively documented on the
2000 link at the Time Team website . 
Figure 7 . 1 Seahenge : the Bronze Age
timber circle at Holme on Sea in situ 
( before excavation )  . This unique site is to be
reburied because there are insufficient funds
to conserve and present it

The common thread that runs through all of
these disputes is control of the past . Those who
control access to sites and artefacts are best
placed to interpret the past for the wider
public . It is their values which will be reflected
in accounts of the past and their values which
in turn are supported by those accounts .

MODES OF
COMMUNICATION
IN ARCHAEOLOGY
Figure 7 . 2 The communication of archaeological information . These are the main modes of
communication used in archaeology . There is overlap between some categories , for example some
museums also provide education services and have their own websites
126 ■ ARCHAEOLOGY COURSEBOOK
KEY STUDIES
Different modes of communication
A specialist pottery report within a site
excavation report
The audience is largely other professionals , 
particularly pottery specialists . Only a few
hundred copies have been printed , so the
report is expensive to buy and you can
probably only obtain it from a university
library or a specialist archaeological
bookshop . Some of the data may only be
readable using a microfiche reader . The report
may contain little or no overall interpretation , 
leaving the expert readers to draw their own
conclusions . The precise , scientific nature and
language of the report makes it fairly
inaccessible to the general public but it is an
essential reference for pottery specialists and
for researchers who can access the published
report instead of having to examine the
pottery . In the future , an electronic version
might increase accessibility for specialists
while 3D reconstructions might make the
report interesting to a wider audience . 
However , this would be expensive . 
A Time Team excavation on television
Some professionals despair at the idea of a
three-day excavation against the clock but
they are not the intended audience for this
programme . Its main function is to provide
entertainment to a general audience whilst
educating them in some aspects of archaeological methods and interpretations . The
format of a time-limited challenge to a group
of personalities is well established in popular
television through house and garden makeover
shows . Technical language and ideas are
communicated simply through computergenerated images while the routine or
time-consuming aspects of excavation and
post-excavation work are edited out in favour
of action involving celebrity diggers . Its
entertainment value is attested to by its high
ratings . It has raised public awareness of 
Figure 7 . 4 Time Team : probably the most
successful vehicle for bringing archaeology
to a wide audience
Figure 7 . 3 Using computer aided design 
( CAD ) to reconstruct pottery in 3D
listed in this text and the bibliography provide
examples to get you started . 
One of the reasons for such diversity is that
there are many differing audiences for
archaeology and their requirements vary . 
Consider how your requirements of a site or
museum might differ from those of a researcher
or of a class of 5 year olds . As a result , what is
a perfectly adequate mode of communication
for one person may be inaccessible or too
shallow for another . The contrast between a
specialist pottery report and an episode of
Time Team illustrates this point well . 
Archaeological communication and new
technology
Before 1990 , most archaeological knowledge
was communicated via lectures and the printed
word . While these are familiar mediums , it is
expensive to produce reports and books and
there is often a considerable timelag before new
ideas and discoveries are widely disseminated . 
Developments in communications technology
present a great opportunity to archaeology and
practice is rapidly changing . 
Virtual reality displays and GIS systems 
( see p . 9 ) are still expensive but digital
photography and basic websites are now
accessible to most people . This has enabled a
much wider range of people to produce and
disseminate archaeological information . A look
at some good examples illustrates this : 
■ Individual enthusiasts , for example the
Stone Pages : 

■ Groups of enthusiasts , for example the
Megalithic Society : 

■ Local surveys , for example Thetford Forest : 

■ Individual excavations , for example
Stanway : 

flixboro . htm
■ University projects , for example Gardoms
Edge

■ National sites , for example the Coa
petroglyphs in Portugal :

KEY SKILL
Assessing modes of communication using the 4 As
Assessing particular modes of communication and display is usually done in relation to specific
case studies , for example ‘ How might archaeologists best communicate the results of a
particular excavation ?  ’ or ‘ How could a specific site be better presented to the public ?  ’ 
In order to address these issues you should consider the following criteria : 
■ Audience : who is it for and what might they hope to get from it ? 
■ Accessibility : does its design and location enable it to reach its intended audience ( s )  ? 
■ Adequacy : is it useful for that audience ? 
■ Alternatives : would another mode of communication be more effective ? 
Select several examples such as a local museum display , a TV programme or a site report . 
Copy out the grid below on a large sheet of paper and complete it , using yourself as a student
on your particular course as the intended audience . Pay particular attention to your reason for
using the sources and why it was useful or not . 
Now repeat the exercise taking the part of a different audience , for example a tourist visiting
the area , a primary school group . You should start to gain an awareness of the difficulties of
meeting diverse needs within one mode of communication .

■ International research projects , for example

■ Museums , for example National Museums
of Scotland at 

■ Government agencies , for example Cadw at 

■ American archaeology videos at 

The time between recording and presenting to
an audience is much reduced . Many excavations
now offer daily diaries or web cams on their
websites . Shapwick ( see p . 15 ) illustrates this
well . The numbers visiting most site websites
far exceed the numbers of site reports sold . 
Moreover , the audience is now global rather
than largely national . 
The use of hyperlinks in text offers the chance
to satisfy more than one audience at the same
time . A basic account can be supplemented by
detailed discussion in other linked documents . 
Similarly , this can be applied to maps and site
plans through point and click options as at
Kilmartin . 

Not only does digital imagery readily offer
high quality colour photographs where their
use was previously rationed , it also goes
beyond the limitations of two-dimensional
illustration on A3 sized paper . Maps and plans
can be presented at a much larger scale and
three-dimensional modelling is possible as at
Wroxeter . 

Projects / BT / default . htm
The online journal Internet Archaeology is
exploring the wider potential of the internet for
archaeological publishing . 

Finally there is the potential for discussing
ideas and seeking help from fellow archaeologists through discussion groups such as the
CBA ’ s Britarch list or the archaeology teachers
group Ed-arch-uk . 

uk . html
Problems with using the internet for
research
There are , of course , some drawbacks to the
new technology . The sheer volume of material
available means that you have to be selective
but it is often difficult to immediately see what
might be relevant . A particular problem for
students is that referencing conventions are not
applied to the same degree as in printed
material . It is often hard to tell what is opinion , 
fantasy or based on evidence . Often there is no
way of checking . If you cite internet sources in
essays at undergraduate level , be sure to
appraise them thoroughly . A further problem , 
admittedly more for your lecturers , is
plagiarism . It is easy to cut and paste someone
else ’ s work into your own . Resist the
temptation . If you are caught , the penalties can
be severe .

PRESENTING THE PAST ■ 129
Applying communication issues on your
course
By now you will appreciate how hard it is to
successfully communicate in ways that reach 
all possible audiences . Some sources will have
clearly targeted particular audiences . Others , 
such as sites or museums , will probably have
changed their methods to reach wider
audiences . This may have involved diversifying
the types of presentation or a wholesale change
in the way collections or a site are displayed . 
If you wished to follow up this topic as a
major project on a particular site you should be
able to find one of their staff who can explain
their thinking on this . 
A second approach to this topic on some
courses , including A Level , is to ask you to
consider how to present a site which may
currently be inaccessible , or has little existing
display material . This might typically include
sites under excavation or a site that has no
upstanding features . In these cases you need to
not only draw on your knowledge of different
types of communication and their suitability
for particular audiences but understand some
of the other issues facing museum and site
management staff . These include : 
■ funding : the latest high-tech displays might
be nice but how realistic is a budget to
provide , maintain and secure them ?

PRESENTING THE PAST ■ 131
KEY STUDY
The ‘ reconstructed ’ Anglo-Saxon village of
West Stow
West Stow in Suffolk uses a variety of
different means to present an excavated and
recorded site to the public . 
Excavation of this site revealed traces of a
number of features including rectangular
grubenhauser . The materials used had not
survived in the sandy local soil but postholes , 
pits and beam slots were preserved , as were a
range of inorganic artefacts and a quantity of
animal bones . The site reports catalogue and
interpret the finds for the archaeological
profession and also highlight the problem of
interpreting the above ground structure of the
buildings . 
Rectangular pits with domestic rubbish are
common on early Anglo-Saxon sites . These
grubenhauser had previously been interpreted
as pit dwellings , in part reflecting the view
amongst classically influenced archaeologists
that their inhabitants really were barbaric . 
With increasing knowledge of Anglo-Saxon
carpentry and construction techniques , 
experimental archaeology has developed
alternative models . At West Stow several
versions were constructed over the excavated
features . It is now thought likely that grubenhauser had suspended floors with the rubbish
entering the pit after the building ’ s
abandonment . 
There is also a debate about the internal
decoration and use of buildings . The site , 
which includes a display centre through which
visitors enter a recreation of the settlement , 
addresses these issues and the problem of
multiple audiences in a number of ways . 
■ Several different versions of the buildings
were built on the sites of the originals so
that visitors could enter each and judge
them against the plans in guidebooks and
the visitors centre . 
■ Artefacts are displayed in the visitors
centre with pictures and reconstructions
alongside to show how they were used . 
■ Activity areas allow visitors to see how
artefacts might have been made . 
■ Demonstrations by experts in fields such
as green woodworking are available to
those interested . 
■ Audio tours offer the alternative of a
populist commentary by ‘ a Saxon ’  , which

■ impact : modern interactive displays take up
more room than traditional displays of
exhibits . In a finite space , what would you
have to remove from display ? Visitor
centres and display boards may be useful , 
but will they alter or ruin the visual impact
of a site ? 
■ Accuracy : reconstructions are popular with
the public but may be misleading . It may be
possible to reconstruct the wooden handle
of an iron tool with a reasonable degree of
accuracy but rebuilding a Neolithic
structure from a mass of postholes will be
more problematic . Is it better to show how
something was used , even if it may be
inaccurate , or provide the evidence and ask
people ( who are not specialists ) to try to
make up their own minds ? The websites in

familiar . 
a ) Briefly describe the site and outline the types of evidence available .  ( 200 words ) 
b ) Produce a visual presentation to show how it could best be presented to visitors to the
area .  ( 800 words ) 
Your account should include a justification of your selection of key methods of communication
and use sketches , diagrams and plans where appropriate to illustrate it . Remember to consider

The world heritage site at Lascaux provides a
good example of what can be done with a large

caves was damaging the delicate Palaeolithic
wall-paintings there . The response has been to
close the cave but to construct a copy nearby
for visitors whilst producing an interactive
website to enable virtual exploration of the real
thing .

Part Two
Studying Themes in
Archaeology
The content of archaeology courses can be arranged in many ways . All include methods
but they are selective and often include an element of choice in their areas of archaeological knowledge . Some focus on particular parts of the world , following continuity and
change over time , e . g .  ‘ British prehistory ’  . Others may focus on change but take a
whole world perspective , looking at topics such as ‘ human origins ’ or ‘ the origins of
farming ’  . Some concentrate on particular cultures in more limited periods such as ‘ the
classical world ’ while others , including A Level , are organised around themes . Whichever
course you take you will need to use case studies . In fact the same case studies might be
relevant to all these courses . For example , the Iron Age settlement at Hengistbury Head
could be used to study : 
■ the emergence of elites and trade in Iron Age Britain
■ the development of towns and commercial trade
■ the influence of the Roman Empire
■ settlement function , exchange and manufacturing . 
We have chosen to organise this section thematically partly because it mirrors the A
Level syllabus and partly because an understanding of the themes is more transferable . 
A study of Maya temples may not be immediately useful to a student studying Neolithic
Britain and vice versa , but an introduction to concepts of religion and ritual will be
useful to both . We have included content , but its function is to illustrate . It may well be
in just the right size chunks to put into essays but it is there to provide examples of
archaeological ideas and debates . 

For periods where there are written sources
such as Ancient Greece or medieval Europe , 
archaeologists have tended to use texts as the
means to interpret and understand past belief
systems . For cultures where there are no
written sources , many archaeologists have held
the view that uncovering the nature of past
religious belief from material remains is
beyond their ability . In the 1950s Hawkes
argued that there was a hierarchy of inferences
which archaeologists could make from their
sources . Using material remains they could say
a great deal about technology and economics , 
much less about society and very little about
belief . How can you understand thoughts
from bones , sherds and postholes ? His
argument has become known as Hawkes ’ 
ladder of inference ( see Figure 8 . 1 )  . 
Since the 1960s there has been an explosion of
interest amongst the general public in past
religions , especially those of the later
prehistoric period . The reluctance of many
archaeologists to discuss religion left a gap that
was filled by a range of other explanations , 
which fed on public interest in ancient
monuments . Often these involved projecting
current concerns onto evidence from the past . 
The most famous was Von Daniken ’ s depiction
of god as an astronaut . This view attributed
great monuments from the past to aliens . For
example , the Nazca lines in Peru became alien

Religion and 
Ritual
Chapter 8
YOUR GOALS
You need to understand
■ the key concepts drawn from sociology and anthropology that archaeologists use to help
define and explain past beliefs and rituals
■ the techniques and sources archaeologists use to interpret evidence of religious belief and
practices
■ case studies from your area of study , which illustrate religion and ritual from that period or
culture
■ how to use evidence to support longer pieces of writing . 
landing strips . More recently a New Age
version of prehistory has linked together sites
from various periods as evidence of a universal
cult of an earth goddess . Partly in response , 
archaeologists have borrowed a battery of
analytical techniques and concepts from other
disciplines including ethnography , sociology
and critical theory to explore religion and
ritual . It is now a core element of study for
many periods . A particularly influential idea
has been the fact that for many cultures
religion cannot neatly be separated from social
organisation or even economics . It influences
the way people behave and therefore leaves
traces in their material culture . 
The analytical power of computers is increasingly enlisted in searching for patterns , particularly in the disposal of artefacts and the siting of
monuments . Use of these techniques has in turn
led to criticism of written sources for what they
omit and because they are often ambivalent . 
Archaeology may have much to offer the study
of religion in the classical period after all . 
In this chapter we have tried to explain some of
the more unfamiliar concepts which archaeologists have adopted in depth . We have also
provided examples of the methods and insights
used by archaeologists to tease out clues about
belief and ritual from material remains . 
WHAT IS RELIGION ? 
You are most likely to be familiar with modern
world religions . These are atypical . Christianity , Judaism and Islam , for example , are all
monotheistic ( one god ) religions which provide codes of conduct for life , have permanent
religious institutions and offer life after death
to believers . There have been religions that
have differed on each of these points . At the
other end of the scale from the states ( see 
p . 239 )  , which have promoted world religions , 
are hunter-gatherer societies . They tend to see
themselves as part of , rather than in control of , 
nature and their religion may be simply one
part of their daily life rather than something
done on special occasions . There is far more
variety in those small-scale societies which
survive today than in world religions , and they
may provide better insights into the wealth of
lost belief systems . After all humans have spent
most of history hunting and foraging for food
rather than growing it . 
Giddens ( 1989 ) provides a broad definition of
religion which you may find useful :  ‘ a set of
symbols , invoking feelings of reverence or awe 
.  .  . linked to rituals or ceremonials practised by
a community of believers ’  . These symbols may
be of gods and goddesses , ancestral or nature
spirits , or impersonal powers . Rituals can

Figure 8 . 1 Hawkes ’ ladder of inference ( after
Hawkes 1954 )  . The higher one goes up the
ladder the harder it is to make inferences on
the basis of archaeological evidence
consist of prayers , songs , dances , feasting , drug
taking , offerings and sacrifices . People often use
them to try to influence supernatural powers
and beings to their advantage and to deal with
problems that cannot be solved through the
application of technology . However , there are
some religions without objects of worship . In
Confucianism and Taoism , for example , the
individual attempts to attain a higher level
through correctly following specified principles . 
WHAT IS THE FUNCTION OF RELIGION ? 
Archaeologists are more interested in how
religion affected the people practising it rather
than whether a particular religion accomplished
what its believers hoped . All religions cater to
basic human social and psychological needs . 
Some of these , such as the need to explain what
happens when people die , may be universal if
we are correct in our interpretation of the
archaeological evidence for burial and
associated activities since at least 40 , 000 years
ago . Common functions include : 
■ Explaining the unknown in order to
provide meaning and reduce anxiety . A
belief in a divine force can provide hope
and comfort in difficult times . The death of
a family member may be easier to cope
with if they are believed to exist beyond
death . Ritual at a time of crisis may give
people the confidence to cope with problems , for example , praying before a battle . 
■ Establishing rules and models of behaviour . 
Most religions put divine power behind
definitions of what is right and wrong . 
They may tell believers the ‘ right ’ way to
live . Religion can be used to enforce
obedience to a ruler ( e . g . medieval kings ) or
even to justify rebellion . 
■ The maintenance of social solidarity was
seen as the primary function of religion by
the sociologist Durkheim . His study of
totemism ( see p . 148 ) amongst Australian
aboriginal societies suggested that what was
being worshipped represented society and
its values . By holding collective ceremonies
people reinforce their sense of togetherness
and social cohesion . 
■ Transmitting memory , especially in nonliterate societies , by the learning of oral
traditions and through repetitive rituals . 
The classic example of this is the telling of
creation myths . Myths are explanatory
narratives that rationalise religious beliefs
and practices . Myths invariably are full of
accounts of the doings of various supernatural beings and hence serve to reinforce
belief in them . The building of religious
monuments can literally set collective
memories in stone .

The Temple of Karnak at Luxor
In Egypt , Amun ’ s great temple of Karnak , through the physical symbolism of the building , 
offers key insights into the creation myth , the role of the priesthood and the nature of rituals . 
Every pharaoh felt bound to leave his mark on this temple by lavish construction works of his
own such that over time it extended over an area that would encompass more than a dozen
medieval cathedrals . 
The layout of Karnak was designed as a microcosm of the world at the time of its creation by
the god Amun . Its high walls and huge gates or ‘ pylons ’ excluded ordinary people . Only priests
could enter the temple and they , like all other things dedicated to Amun , had to be pure and
clean . They shaved off all their body hair , bathed daily in the Sacred Lake in the heart of the
temple and dressed in spotless robes . Rituals depicted in hieroglyphics include the journey of
Amun ’ s sacred boat from Karnak to Luxor with attendants singing and dancing . The desire for
the maintenance of order is also featured symbolically in the temple reliefs . Battle scenes show
foreigners as disorderly mobs until they have been conquered and brought within the civilising
influence of Egypt . Then they are shown in neat lines . In the nearby Luxor Temple this contrast
is very clear : the Egyptian infantry and chariots at the Battle of Kadesh are immaculately
organised in geometric squads while the opposing Hittites are in total disarray .

The myth at the heart of
the temple is that of the
original creation of the
world from the waters of
chaos . The ‘ Hypostyle Hall ’ 
represented the ‘ Swamp of
Creation ’ with its forest of
columns whose capitals
were carved in the shape
of plants such as papyrus . 
Amun came into being in
this chaos . He lifted
himself out of the water
and masturbated himself
to produce the two
constituent elements of all
life : wet and dry . From
this act comes the first
land in the form of the ‘ primeval mound ’  ( the temple ) and then the sky and later the first
inhabitants of that Egyptian ‘ Eden ’  : Isis and Osiris . In the hidden depths of the temple was the
cult statue of Amun . The exact nature of the statue is much disputed due to the damage
inflicted on the portraits of Amun in antiquity and the desire of previous generations of
scholars to play down the sexual nature of Egyptian iconography . For the Egyptians this statue
was a house for the god , a place where he could take up residence to interact with mortals . 
Through his divine presence it became ‘ alive ’ in a very real sense . The priests would anoint the
statue , dress it and entertain it each day as they would the pharaoh himself . One relief shows a
group of females playing musical instruments while others clap rhythmically . They are led by a
woman who is identified by the hieroglyphs as ‘ the Hand of God ’  . On a balance of probabilities
scholars believe that the statue of Amun was shown in a state of sexual excitement grasping
his erect penis and that the reliefs are picturing a ritual re-enactment of the original moment
of creation induced by the rhythmic music and hand clapping . The central question here is
whether the ritual was essentially a metaphorical act that happened in people ’ s minds or
whether it had some sort of physical reality enacted by the chief priest of the temple or by the
pharaoh himself once a year .

Detecting evidence of past beliefs and
practices
When examining material evidence a standing
joke amongst archaeologists has been the idea
that anything that can ’ t immediately be
explained must be ritual . While there has been
some overenthusiasm in what is still a relatively
new area of archaeological interpretation , most
studies are based on far more than an odd
shaped building or one figurine . Egyptologists

Zapotec religion
Flannery and Marcus used three key methods in their exploration of beliefs from the Zapotec
civilisation that flourished in the Oaxaca Valley of southern Mexico between 200 BC and 
AD 700 . 
There was evidence of great continuity in local populations from Zapotec times until the
Spanish conquest in the sixteenth century . The archaeologists were able to use what they
termed a direct historical approach ( DHA )  . Spanish priests had documented local ‘ pagan ’ 
customs that were used to form a hypothesis for testing by excavation . The archaeologists
predicted that anything with breath ( pee ) would be sacred and that ancestors would be
worshipped . The burning of copal incense and sacrifices of blood , jade , living things and exotic
goods would be made to petition elemental forces such as earthquake and lightning . They
expected to find evidence of priests who lived in two-roomed houses with sacrifices made in the
inner room and who used drugs to reach ecstatic states . 
Excavations at San Jose Mogote revealed a series of two-roomed buildings with the same
east–west axis superimposed upon them . The inner rooms had been kept scrupulously clean
although there were traces of repeated burning in them . Tiny pieces of debris in the corners
were frequently from obsidian blades or stingray stings , used for bloodletting until historic
times . Buried in the floor were tiny statues , jade beads and the bones of quail ; a bird believed
to be pure . The Spanish hadn ’ t recorded this aspect of religion . Underfloor offerings also
included effigies of the lightning clouds , hail and wind . Research amongst local people revealed
that they called the statuettes ‘ little people of the clouds ’  . Ancestors were also known as cloud
people . 
Through a mixture of historical records , analyses of excavated architecture and artefacts , and
ethnography , Flannery and Marcus were able to reach conclusions about Zapotec reverence for
ancestors and natural forces and the types of ritual practice involved in worship . 

humanorigins / religion . html # zapotec Marcus and Flannery 1994
have the advantage of the Book of the Dead to
draw on but for other cultures different
approaches are required . Analogies drawn from
ethnography have been particularly useful . Not
for direct parallels so much as to demonstrate a
range of possible options and influences and to
prevent simplistic interpretation . It may appear
common sense that a burial with many goods
was that of a wealthy person , yet ethnography
has provided examples where this is not the
case . Studies have often focused on repeated
patterns . These include symbols that recur in
similar places or on specific types of artefact ; 
non-random patterns of deposition of
particular artefacts or animal remains and the
distribution of deposits and monuments across
the landscape . The treatment of boundaries in
the past has been a focus of many studies . 
WHAT KINDS OF RELIGION WERE
THERE ? 
Most known religions include a belief in
supernatural beings and forces through whom
appeals for aid may be directed . For
convenience we may divide these into three
categories : deities , ancestral spirits and nature
spirits . While some societies have only believed
in one of these categories , it has been common
for belief in several or all of them to co-exist , 
for example belief in evil spirits in medieval
Europe . 
Major deities
Gods and goddesses are great and remote
beings who are usually seen as controlling the
universe . If several are recognised ( polytheistic ) 
each often has charge of a particular part of the
universe . Hinduism , the oldest major world
religion , is around 6 , 000 years old and is
polytheistic . Its contemporaries included the
gods of Ancient Greece : Zeus was the lord of
the sky , Poseidon was the ruler of the sea and
Hades was the lord of the underworld and
ruler of the dead . In addition to these three
brothers there were many other deities of both
sexes . Each embodied characteristics seen as
typical of male and female roles ; each was
particularly concerned with specific aspects of
life and the workings of the world , or indeed
universe . Pantheons or collections of gods and
goddesses , such as those of the Greeks , were
also common in non-western states such as
Egypt or the Maya . States that grew through
conquest often incorporated the local deities of
conquered peoples into the official state
pantheon . For example , the Romano-British

Copan
The acropolis of Copan in Honduras
exemplifies the way in which religious beliefs
can be embodied in material culture . The
layout of the city reflects the cosmology of
the Maya in a general sense and some special
buildings have more particular symbolic
meaning . The temple pyramids symbolised
mountains , the surface of the plaza the
waters . Temple interiors were caves or magic
portals to the world of the supernatural and
stone statues of kings ( stelae ) were symbolic
world trees . These depict the kings bridging
the upper and lower worlds . They reveal the
source of the kings ’ authority to be their
power to intercede with the gods and
ancestors on behalf of the people . Glyphs 
( carved reliefs )  , architecture , burial and
iconography all help piece together the beliefs
and rituals of the Maya . 
Structure 22 is a temple building with
commanding views over the whole acropolis
and the valley beyond . Steps rise to its
entrance , which was carved to look like a
mask of the earth monster . The fragments
remaining include the stone fangs of the
monster ’ s lower jaw . Entering here , watched
by his people below , the king symbolically died
and was reborn when he emerged . He would
be wearing an elaborate costume of feathers ,

site at Bath or Aquae Sulis may have been the
centre for a cult combining the local deity Sul
and the Roman goddess Minerva . Specific
deities are identified from repeated images on
buildings or artefacts ranging from mosaics to
statues . 
Belief in gods , goddesses or both , often seemed
to parallel what we know of the gender
relationships between men and women in
everyday life ( p . 245 )  . In societies in which
women have less power than men , the nature
of ‘ god ’ is defined in masculine terms . This is
commonest in societies where the economy is
based upon herding animals or on intensive
agriculture , which would have been largely
male activities . In such societies men must
often have been seen as rather distant authority
figures to their children . Goddesses , on the
other hand , appear more often in societies
where women make the major contribution to
the economy , enjoy some measure of equality
with men and in which men are more involved
in the lives of their children . Such societies

Schele and Miller 1986

Figure 8 . 8 Photograph of a panel from altar Q at Copan . The
iconography seamlessly links history , rulers and the gods
often depend on horticulture or specialised
craft production , which is done by women . 
You might compare the central role of the
production of vegetables to feed pigs in Papua
New Guinea , which underlie the ‘ Moka ’ ritual , 
with the evidence for rich female grave goods
in early Thai society at Khok Phanom Di . The
masculine god figure that replaced various
goddess cults amongst the Hebrews during the
late 2nd millennium BC may have helped
establish gender relationships in which women
have traditionally been expected to submit to
the rule of men . This in turn shaped Jewish , 
Christian and Islamic society . Gimbutas ( 1991 ) 
took up this theme in her book The
Civilisation of the Goddess and argued that
world religions developed to legitimise the
replacement of early agricultural societies in
which women played leading roles . 
Ancestral spirits
A belief in ancestral spirits has its origins in the
widespread idea that human beings are made
up of two parts : the body and some kind of
vital spirit , which in Mesoamerica for example
resides in the blood . For example the Maya
Indians have always maintained that each
person had a ‘ spirit-companion ’ that could
leave the body and move around during sleep . 
The ‘ spirit-companion ’ was envisaged as an
animal . One inscription tells us that ‘ the watery
jaguar is the “ way ” of the Lord ( King ) of
Seibal ’  . Given such a concept , it is only a small
step to believe that the spirit could be freed by
death from the body and have a continued
existence . It has something in common with
recent accounts of ‘ out of body experiences ’  . 
Where people do believe in ancestral spirits , 
they are frequently seen as retaining an active
interest and even membership in society . For
example the ‘ ghost ancestors ’ of the Wape
might either provide or withhold meat from
their living descendants . Like living persons , 
ancestral spirits may be well or badly disposed
towards the living , but they are often
capricious and unpredictable , hence the need to
appease them with offerings . Is this the
explanation behind some of the ritual
behaviour observed in Neolithic societies at
long barrows and causewayed enclosures ? 
Many authorities believe that it is , and recent
ethnographic parallels have been sought in
Madagascar along these lines . 
Whatever the involvement in particular past
societies , belief in ancestral spirits provided a
strong sense of continuity . These beliefs seem
to have been particularly strong amongst early
farming communities . Ancestors may have
linked past , present and future generations and
ownership of particular land . 
Animism
One of the most common sets of beliefs about
the supernatural world is usually referred to as
animism . This centres on the idea that the
living share the physical and spiritual world
with all sorts of spirits . Animals , plants and
people may all have their own individual
spirits , as may springs , mountains , or other
natural features . Roman statues of the rivers
Tyne and Thames exemplify this belief very
clearly . 
People who believe in animism are inclined to
see themselves as being part of nature rather
than superior to it . This includes most huntergatherers , as well as those food-producing
people who see little difference between a
human life and that of any growing plant . 
Gods and goddesses may have created the
world and perhaps provided the main physical
fabric of that world but it is spirits to whom

Neolithic tombs
A range of hypotheses have been put forward
about the nature of the religion of the
builders of the passage graves , cairns and
long barrows of western Europe . Although
these monuments are similar in some ways
there are significant differences in their
contents . In long barrows there was a gradual
change from individual articulated burials to
collections of disarticulated bones as at
Hazleton or re-sorted bones as at West
Kennet . However , this pattern is not universal
and suggests some variety in beliefs . The
tombs that hold the remains of the dead are
often massive while remains of the
settlements of the living are more fleeting . If
a semi-mobile , pastoral economy ( see 
p . 198 ) dominated at the time this may not
be entirely surprising . However , the
importance of the dead is suggested by the
way the location of their remains are
permanently marked on the landscape . Most
writers conclude that there was some sort of
ancestor worship or at least belief in their
spirits . 
Analogies have often been made with the
Merina of Madagasgar who continue to build
and use chambered tombs . While they are
radically different societies there may be
some interesting parallels . The Merinas use a
communal tomb even when they live away , to
emphasis their community and kinship . 
Skeletons are wrapped in the tomb but are
periodically taken out and re-wrapped . This is
an occasion for feasting by the family of the
dead . Passage graves and some barrows could
also be re-entered and there is evidence of
food remains and human remains around
many of them . Perhaps the living and the
dead continued to mix to emphasise
continuity and community . 
Graslund in a comparative study of
Scandinavian tombs from the Neolithic to
Viking periods concluded that settled societies
share a belief in some sort of afterlife and in
souls or spirits . There are two models . The
breath soul leaves the body with its last sigh
and goes to join the ancestors . The free or
dream soul is active when the body sleeps . 
After death it remains with the body until the
flesh is gone . Graslund argued that the
treatment of the body after death corresponds
to the soul belief . Where excarnation or
disarticulation ( see p . 153 ) had occurred
before placing in a tomb it suggested a breath
soul . The tomb served as an ossuary . Where
decomposition occurred inside the tomb it
was a grave . The evidence for this is the
presence of small bones that would have been
lost during excarnation , skeletons in sitting
positions and beads that may have come from
clothing . There are also fatty deposits in the

Figure 8 . 9 A replica of the inside of a
Neolithic tomb with disarticulated human
remains . There is nothing to stop modern
visitors rearranging the bones . A modern
example of taphonomy ! 
one turns for the ordinary needs of daily life
and whom the ordinary hunter may meet
during the hunt or while out roaming the
woods . Many of the indigenous peoples of
North America subscribed to this view of the
world and would pray to the spirits of their 
 ‘ brothers and sisters ’ the animals for success in
the hunt . They asked animals to give up their
lives for the good of people and apologised to
them when they were actually caught . You may
have seen the Hollywood version of this at the
start of the film Last of the Mohicans . 
Totemism is a label sometimes attached to
animistic forms of religion . Here animals or
plants with special powers may be worshipped
or there may be complex rules about their
treatment . Totemism has been used as an
explanation for some of the non-human finds
in prehistoric tombs . Hedges noted that
Isbister Tomb on Orkney contained the
remains of sea eagles while other nearby tombs
held dog or deer bones . However , these may
have been food or in some case scavengers
which entered the tombs independently .

soil in some tombs . For a dream soul the
corpse would have to be cared for as if it
were alive and this would also account for the
presence of grave goods . The shape of passage
graves with their narrow entrances and the
east–west orientation of many ( towards the
sun ) suggest a womb from which the soul is
reborn . 
Those who support the idea of an earth or
fertility goddess have also explored the tombwomb idea . For farmers , fertility is a crucial
issue and reseeding mother earth with the
bones of ancestors may have been a symbolic
gesture to ensure good crops or plentiful
livestock . Other archaeologists have noted the
similarity between some of these monuments
and the longhouses of the first farmers of
central Europe . Although there seems no
direct link between the two groups there 
may be some link in terms of associating
ancestors with a specific place of origin , 
perhaps to establish land rights . Either way , 
the dominant metaphor seems to be of
ancestors . 
The transformation of bodies and the mixing
of bones in many tombs may have other
significance . The disarticulated remains in
some cases are also associated with a variety
of sherds of pottery , often with fresh breaks . 
Perhaps the purpose was to downplay
individual differences and mask inequalities
amongst the living . The remains therefore
could both reflect and reinforce social reality . 
They also offered a symbolic resource both to
the community whose ancestors ’ remains were
held in them and those who were able to
enter the tomb . Some tombs were used for
over 1 , 000 years and beliefs may have
changed over that period . It is also worth
noting that the bones represent a relatively
small proportion of Neolithic populations .

Animatism
Some societies believe in a supernatural power
that exists independently of deities and spirits . 
The people of Melanesia , for example , believe
that ‘ mana ’ exists as a force inherent in all
objects . In itself it is not physical but it can be
revealed through its physical effects . When a
warrior experiences success in battle this will
not be as a result of his own strength but
directly attributable to the ‘ mana ’ carried with
him in the form of an amulet that hangs around
his neck . In much the same way , in farming
societies an individual may know a great deal
about the right way to treat plants , about soil
conditions and the correct time for sowing and
harvesting , but still be dependent on ‘ mana ’ for
the success of his crop . He may build a simple
altar for this power at the end of the field , as
often seen in the rice fields of Bali . If the crop is
good , it is a sign that the farmer has in some way
acquired the necessary ‘ mana ’  . The possession of
objects containing such power may provide the
owner with confidence . For example , in going
into battle . Confidence might then lead to
fearlessness and victory . This would then ‘ prove ’ 
the power of the ‘ mana ’  . The Sioux followers of
the Ghost Dance cult provide a less successful
example . They believed their magical shirts
would stop bullets in their final conflict with the
US army in the late nineteenth century . 
Belief in magic has some similarities with
animatism . Magic involves individuals
influencing events through potions or chanting . 
It can also involve divination , astrology and
curses such as those found at Aquae Sulis and
on the walls of Pompeii . The wearing of
charms to bring good fortune and ward off evil
combines elements of magic and animatism and
has survived in a watered down way in
societies which have been Christian for
hundreds of years . 
Havilland 1994
RELIGIOUS CHANGE
Comparative studies over long periods often
reveal changes in the evidence for religion . This
can be useful as the contrasts often suggest
much about the nature of beliefs . The overlap
between paganism and Christianity revealed in
the changing grave goods and orientation of
bodies from Anglo-Saxon cemeteries such as
Lechlade and Sutton Hoo are well known . 
On Cranborne Chase very different monuments
spanning over 1 , 000 years are oriented or
physically linked to earlier ancestral monuments . This suggests that while the precise
beliefs had changed , ancestors were still venerated although their identity may have been
redefined . The continuing power and importance of earlier beliefs can also be seen 
in the reuse of some religious sites . At
Cairnpapple an open monument associated with
a range of burials was filled with an individual

cairn in the Bronze Age , suggesting that some
people had a better claim on ancestral spirits
than did others . At Stanton Drew magnetometer
surveys have revealed that the stone circles
replaced earlier timber monuments . The nature
of the religious changes of the reformation can
be seen in the study of structural and decorative
changes in churches . This is most evident when
medieval wall-paintings are revealed under
puritan whitewash as at Baunton . The total
abandonment of earlier beliefs appears to be
evident in the way later Bronze Age field
systems cut across earlier monuments whose
faint traces had been respected for over 1 , 000
years , as at Stonehenge . 
Bradley 1998
RITUAL ACTIVITY
Much of the value of religion comes from
religious activities . Participation in ceremonies
enables people to relate to higher forces ; it is
religion in action . Ritual involves repeated
performance of religious activities , usually at a
particular place . It can reinforce the social
bonds of a group and reduce tensions . 
Participants can feel a wave of reassurance , 
security and even ecstasy and a sense of
closeness . Although the rituals and practices
vary considerably , even those rites that seem to
us the most bizarrely exotic can be shown to
serve the same basic social and psychological
function . Anthropologists have classified
several different types of ritual , a major
division being between ‘ rites of passage ’ and 
 ‘ rites of intensification ’  . 
Rites of passage
Rites of passage are ceremonies to mark crucial
stages in the life cycle of the individual . These
might include birth , puberty , marriage , 
parenthood , and advancement to a higher class , 
occupational specialisation and death . 
Anthropological analysis of ceremonies , which
help individuals through these potential crisis
points , has often identified three stages : 
separation , transition , and incorporation . The
individual would first be ritually removed from
the society as a whole , then isolated for a
liminal period and finally returned to society
with a new status . 
Van Gennep ( 1909 ) observed this pattern
amongst Australian aborigines . When boys
were to be initiated into manhood , elders led
them to secret locations in the bush . Women
cried and pretended to resist their removal
while the boys pretended to be dead . In the
bush the boys were taught the culture and
stories of the tribe but also went through
ceremonies including minor operations , such 
as circumcision , to teach them to bear pain . 
During this period the boys were ‘ dead ’ to the
tribe . On returning they were welcomed with
ceremonies , as though they had returned from
the dead . The ceremony highlighted their new
status as adults and reminded existing adults 
to act towards them in the appropriate 
ways . They skipped the ill-defined status of 
 ‘ teenager ’  , which causes problems in western
society . 
In the same way female initiation rites prepared
Mende girls in West Africa for womanhood . 
When they begin to menstruate , they were
removed from society to spend weeks , or even
months in seclusion , usually on the grounds
that their menstrual blood would ‘ contaminate ’ 
that with which it comes into contact . There , 
they are trained by experienced women and
change their appearance , setting aside the
remnants of their childhood and undergoing
surgery to remove their clitoris . Mende women
150 ■ ARCHAEOLOGY COURSEBOOK
returned from their initiation as fully adult
women in control of their sexuality and ready
for marriage and childbearing . 
Rites of intensification
Rites of intensification mark crises in the life of
the group . Whatever the precise nature of the
crisis ( war , disease , etc ) mass ceremonies are
performed to mitigate the danger . Because 
these rites are carried out at a group rather than
an individual level , the effect is to unite people
in a common effort in such a way that fear or
confusion are replaced by optimism and collective action and the natural balance is restored . 
In regions where the seasons differ enough to
force changes in human behaviour patterns , 
annual ceremonies develop .  ( Christmas replaced
midwinter festivities dating back at least to the
Iron Age .  ) Participation in such ceremonies
cultivates the habit of reliance on supernatural
forces through ritual activity , which can be
activated in other stressful circumstances . 
A growing body of evidence from late Bronze
Age and Iron Age sites suggests rites of
intensification . At Flag Fen the building of and
maintenance of a very large structure is
associated with the sacrifice of dogs and
deposition of ritually smashed valuable
artefacts into water . Contemporary evidence of
water sacrifices against the context of environmental change and social conflict suggests rites
of propitiation , perhaps in appeals to a water or
underground deity . The widespread deposition
of metal artefacts in water and the discovery of
apparently ritually killed bodies in bogs in
Britain and Denmark suggest that these
practices and perhaps the associated beliefs may
have been widespread . 
The act of monument building may be
ritualistic in itself . It unites people and their
collective resources in pursuit of a shared , and
subsequently memorable , goal . Recent work on
the Cleaven Dyke in Scotland has revealed that
it was constructed in stages and that the
monument may not have ever been totally
visible . The process may have been more
significant than the monument . 
Funerary ceremonies
Funerals blur this neat distinction . The death of
an individual can also be a crisis for an entire
group , particularly if the group is small . The
survivors must readjust , take up new roles and
work out how to behave towards one another . 
They also need to reconcile themselves to the
loss of someone to whom they were
emotionally tied . This can take extreme forms . 
One of the funerary rites of the Melanesians
was ritual cannibalism . This was felt to be a
supreme act of reverence , love and devotion . 
Funerals offer the opportunity for outpourings
of emotions without disrupting society . They
can also emphasise that the values of the group
outlive the individual . Burials are just one part
of the funerary process but they are the most
archaeologically visible . This does not mean
they were the most important part .

Propitiation
Making offerings or sacrifices to a spirit
or deity . The widespread burials of human
and animal remains in grain pits , as at
Danebury , are often interpreted as such
offerings .

KEY STUDY
The Yaxchilan Lintels
These huge sculptural slabs which once occupied prominent locations above doorways in
temples offer us many insights into Maya belief and ritual , particularly in the area of autosacrifices or bloodletting . Blood was analogous with water and thus vital for the fertility of crops
and for the maintenance of good relations between god and men – a repayment for the
sacrifices made by the gods on mankind ’ s behalf at the time of creation . An example of these
lintels can be seen in the Mexican gallery of the British Museum . It shows Lady Xoc
perforating her tongue and collecting her blood on paper strips to be burnt as an offering . She
is rewarded by the subsequent appearance of one of their ancestors in the form of an armed
warrior dressed as the ‘ Vision Serpent ’  .

Mortuary rituals
The treatment of the dead can overlap with
funerals . The dead may be prepared in advance
for funerals and their remains may need further
ritual treatment afterwards . Much has been
learnt from studying the treatment of the
corpse , particularly its final disposal . There is a
range of possibilities . 
Inhumation ( burial ) is a deliberate setting of
the dead outside the world of the living . Where
this occurs it may be indicative of attitudes to
the dead . Roman and Christian cemeteries are
placed apart from the living while some Upper
Palaeolithic burials , as at Franchthi Cave , were
kept close to the living . The orientation and
position of the body – flexed , extended or
contorted – may be significant . For example , 
foetal positions may indicate some belief in
rebirth . 
Cremation is more complex . Funeral pyres can
leave several kilos of charred bones . The fire
may destroy the body and release the spirit but
these remains may have to be dealt with in a
secondary ceremony . This can involve burial . 
Excarnation is also likely to be part of a
process . It involves exposing the body for
scavengers and the decay process to clean the
flesh from the bones . Parsees practise ‘ Sky
burial ’ today and there is increasing evidence of
excarnation from Neolithic times . The human
bone evidence at Hambledon Hill was particularly persuasive . Cleaned bones may be used
in other rites or stored in an ossuary .

RELIGION AND RITUAL ■ 153
Figure 8 . 12 A pot being excavated from grave 5 at Empingham . Were grave goods such as these the
possessions of the dead , offerings to them or the gods , or food for their journey to an afterworld ? 
Mummification is often an elaborate process , 
which can involve removing some parts of the
body . It may be believed that the body can be
used by the person ’ s spirit in another world or
the future . The use of certain types of coffin or
funeral vaults that may slow down natural
decay processes may reflect similar beliefs . 
Parker-Pearson 1999
Sometimes the dead are hard to find . This may
be because they are totally consumed . The
Yanomano grind the cremated remains of their
dead to a powder that they then drink . The
dead thus remain in the living . There are also
ethnographic examples of bones of ancestors
being worn by their descendants . Bruck ’ s 
( 1995 ) study of human remains on Iron Age
sites revealed that bones occurred in many
locations not necessarily thought of as ritual , 
including huts and pits . Again , relics may have
been a part of everyday life . 
Funerary monuments and grave goods
Both of these categories may tell us more about
the mourners and society than they do about
their religious beliefs ( see Chapter 11 )  . 
However , elaborately decorated tombs such as
those in the Valley of the Kings or the reliefs
carved on Maya tombs may provide detailed
information about both beliefs and rituals . 
Gravestones provide many insights for a
variety of cultures , not least about the setting
aside of respected areas for the dead . Goods
buried with the body or which were consumed
in a funeral pyre are suggestive of an afterlife
but this is not necessarily the case . Goods may
be placed in the grave by mourners as tokens
of affection or because they belonged to the
deceased and are considered unlucky or taboo . 
Tools used to prepare the dead , such as razors
or tweezers , may fall into this category . There
may also be important offerings of food or
organic materials that have not survived . The
absence of grave goods doesn ’ t mean that there
was no belief in an afterlife . It may suggest a
belief in an afterlife where people are equal and
provided for or it may reflect an idealised
picture of society that masks differences in
wealth . 
IDENTIFYING RITUAL AND RITUAL
SITES
Most essays on this topic rarely stray from
Renfrew and Bahn ’ s list of indicators . In most
cases their key points – focus of attention , 
boundary zones , symbols or images of the
deity , and participation and offerings – can be
ticked off . Tombs and temples are obvious
places but one can also apply the list to
monuments such as henges and ghats . 
However , there may be exceptions . Their
indicators work best for communal rather than
individual ritual acts , many of which leave no
154 ■ ARCHAEOLOGY COURSEBOOK
Figure 8 . 13 The Pyramids . Probably the best
known funerary monuments in the world
traces . They also rely on there being a distinct
area set aside . Even if it is in a dwelling special
zones can be identified . For example , the altar
or ‘ lararium ’ mounted on the wall of the 
 ‘ House of the Vettii ’ in Pompeii , which depicts
the gods of the house , where small offerings
would be made as a daily ritual to ensure their
continued favour and protection . However , 
there are societies today where there is no clear
demarcation between ritual and the everyday . 
The layout and structure of houses as far apart
as Bali and the Amazon jungle are determined
by religious beliefs . Their orientation , where
domestic activities occur and the direction
particular people can move around them are 
all subject to religious rules . This kind of
ethnographic insight has led archaeologists of
the Neolithic in particular to question whether
what were thought to be houses are domestic
or at least partly ritual sites . Detailed study has
revealed that many are associated with unusual
artefacts , for example Ballygalley , and the
structures do not look domestic . The massive
timber house at Balbridie appeared to have a
screen just inside the door , which would have
made the inside dark and restricted access . 
Another at Balfarg is unlikely to have been
roofed and held finds of grooved ware ( often
associated with ritual ) which contained traces
of narcotic substances . 
Darvill and Thomas 1996

intro . htm
The orientation of sites also suggests that the
ritual and the everyday may be intertwined . 
The orientation of some major monuments
towards the rising or setting sun , phases of the
moon or particular constellations has been
widely studied . In some cases this can clearly
be established , for example the ‘ lightboxes ’ in
tombs at Newgrange and Crantit . 

These may link ancestors with the heavens . 
However , some domestic sites also had very
patterned orientation . Hill ’ s ( 1996 ) comparative
study of Iron Age sites revealed a tendency for
houses to face south-east . This may have been
to do with light , although in Britain south is
the best direction to face to maximise daylight
entering a hut . Light cannot have been a factor
with enclosures . These tend to face south-west
even if local topography and defensive considerations might suggest other directions . It may
be that there was a ‘ right ’ direction from which
to enter or perform activities . 
Identification of objects with known religious
links such as votives provides powerful clues . 
Objects cannot be seen as ritual simply because
they are exotic . However , the form and find
sites of particular artefacts have been used to
suggest ritual objects for most periods . In some
cases the material is important . Amber is
associated with burials from the Mesolithic

Figure 8 . 14 Ritual monuments such as
Rievaulx Abbey are found throughout Britain . 
A visit provides a good opportunity to test out
the indicators of ritual sites
onwards . Its colour of blood and fire with
slight magnetic properties perhaps marked it
out . Pottery vessels with particular designs
such as beakers or grooved ware are often seen
as ritual artefacts . In some cases these have
been repaired but not sufficiently to make them
useable . Figurines and statues such as the 
 ‘ Venus figurines ’ of Palaeolithic Europe and
non-functional artefacts such as copper axes are
more ambivalent unless their context can link
them with other indicators . 
Feasting falls into a similar category . The
sharing of food is a powerful social unifier and
is likely to feature in many rituals , but it can
also be secular . The great halls of most castles
were places of feasting for social rather than
religious purposes . However , where there is
other evidence , the remains of feasts can help
identify ritual functions . 
Evidence of other apparently waste material
has also been used to suggest the embedding of
ritual in the everyday . Hill ’ s ( 1996 ) statistical
analysis of the relationship between different
classes of material culture in pits from Iron
Age Wessex revealed patterns of structured
deposition that are non-random and therefore
deliberate . These are possibly ritualistic . Similar
analysis has been undertaken on middens from
several periods . In particular Scottish and
Danish middens from the Mesolithic with their
deposits of artefacts and human remains may
not have been simply rubbish heaps . Even
apparently economic sites such as flint mines
may have had some ritual function . In the past
the distinction between ritual and practical may
have been irrelevant . Actions may have been
informed by belief .

Identifying ritual sites
This is a simple exercise designed to get
you using and applying the terminology of
ritual . List Renfrew and Bahn ’ s ( 1991 ) 
indicators of ritual sites down one side of
a piece of paper . Visit two different local
centres of religion such as a church or
mosque and see how well the indicators
apply . Jot down what you find against each
point . Next take studies of two archaeological sites from your area of study and
apply the same test . You may find that this
gives you almost enough material to
support an essay on the subject . 
KEY STUDY
The West Kennet timber enclosures
Whittle ’ s ( 1998 ) excavations revealed two
massive egg-shaped enclosures . They had
comparatively short lives and there seems
little doubt that they were places of ritual . 
There was extensive evidence of feasting
such as a large number of meat bones that
had been discarded without being fully
processed . There were considerable
amounts of grooved ware , a pottery type
associated with ritual sites . The circles
were located very close to other ritual and
funerary monuments and the boundaries of
the site had been given special attention . In
particular , the entrances had non-random
deposits of grooved ware , bone and
artefacts . These features have been noted
at other timber enclosures throughout
Britain .

The Temple of the
inscriptions at Palenque
The stone temple-pyramids
at Palenque , in north
central Mexico advertised
the special magical
authority of the reigning
king . The Temple of the
Inscriptions has stucco
figures on the outside
showing the child king
Chan-Bahlum ( SnakeJaguar ) as a child
inheriting power from his
ancestors , including Pacal whose body lies in
the tomb below . The child king has a
prominent umbilical cord that links him to his
famous ancestors and echoes another feature
of the temple known as the ‘ psychoduct ’  . 
Other carvings show captives who were
sacrificed when the new heir was presented to
the people or later when the building itself
was dedicated . The costumes worn by Pacal
and his relatives are full of symbolic elements
such as the net skirt that shows that Pacal
personifies the ‘ First Father ’  . 
Inside , a passage covered with inscriptions
and a staircase lead down to the burial
chamber of Pacal . The floor of the passage
contains the remains of five sacrificial
victims . The chamber is almost filled by a
huge stone sarcophagus , decorated with 
Figure 8 . 15 ( above right ) The templepyramids at Palenque
Figure 8 . 16 ( right ) A Mayan ritual
stairway carved with hieroglyphics . 
Structure 26 at Copan
Art and symbolism have also provided
indications of ritual . Some such as the example
of Palenque are undoubtedly ritual , others are
disputed . Palaeolithic cave art and the swirling
abstract patterns of Neolithic rock carvings
have been particularly hotly debated . Other
approaches to ritual symbolism have focused
on repeated patterns including pairings such as
left / right , male / female , in / out . This technique
has been drawn from media and critical theory . 
Recent examples have been studies of the
colours of stone used to construct cairns . 
On Arran red boulders were chosen to face the
setting sun with white granite facing the rising
sun . Red , the colour of blood , flesh , ochre and
amber and white ( bone and flint ) are often
associated in graves . 
The sequential nature of the buildings at
Palenque and Copan provides a good
opportunity to study the continuity of ideas
over time . Here one ritual structure would be
ceremonially decommissioned and another
structure , which was physically and
iconographically related to its predecessor , 
would be built on top . The same rich
symbolism in these temples is also found in
graves below household patios , which connect
commoners with the ancestors and the great
cycle of heaven and earth . 
LANDSCAPE RITUAL AND BELIEF
A combination of the development of
landscape archaeology and a growing awareness
from ethnography of the ritual significance of
landscape has led archaeologists to look

portraits of Pacal ’ s parents and ancestors . 
The body is dressed in exotic costume items , 
many of jade , which is associated with water
and life , and maize , which represents rebirth . 
The central scene on the lid of the
sarcophagus shows Pacal falling backwards at
the moment of death into the mouth of the
earth monster , which symbolises death . 
Underneath the king is a ‘ bowl of sacrifice ’ 
with its bloodletting equipment , which the
Maya believed to open up a portal into the
other world . A smoking axe , a symbol of
divinity , pierces Pacal ’ s forehead and he is
wearing the jade net skirt , which tells us that
at the moment of death he had become the 
 ‘ Maize God ’  . Behind Pacal rises the World
Tree or Wakah Kan ( see p . 139 ) which
connects the three realms of Underworld , 
Mortal World and the Heavens . The moment
that the tree was raised aloft signifies the
moment of creation to the Maya . The
branches of the tree are shown as a doubleheaded serpent symbolising the serpent of life
and death , the Milky Way and the sceptre of
kingship held by the Maya Divine Lord . 
Snaking into his coffin and extending all the
way up the side of the staircase to the temple
above is the ‘ psychoduct ’  , a tube which
allowed the king ’ s spirit to travel abroad at
night in the form of his ‘ spirit familiar ’  , 
usually a jaguar . It also allowed the priests to
communicate with Pacal now that he had
joined the ancestors .

The Clava Cairns
This group of
monuments
illustrates many of
the different features
of ritual sites . Two of
the cairns are
aligned on the
midwinter sunset so
that when viewed
from the passage of
the north-eastern
cairn the dying sun
disappears over the
south-western cairn . 
The rays of the
setting sun fall on
reddish boulders while the rising sun would
have sparkled on white quartz . The kerbstones
of the cairn were carefully graded in height
from the south-west . Rock carvings both
inside and outside the cairns follow the same
conventions as others in Britain and Ireland . 
The monuments also seem to represent a
change in ritual practice . Excavation by
Bradley revealed low platforms covered in
seashells and flat stones surrounding the
cairns .  ‘ Rays ’ or ridges of stones led out
through the platform to standing monoliths . 
Excavation showed that these were all
integral to the cairns rather than add-ons . 
These monuments seem to have been a
midway stage between ordinary passage
graves , where the views of mortuary rituals
would have been very restricted , to stone
circles , where ritual may have been much
more public and perhaps on a larger scale . 
Bradley 2000a
Figure 8 . 17 View of the Clava Cairns looking down the main
alignment . Note the way the internal kerbstones in the first cairn have
been graded
Figure 8 . 18 View of a standing stone linked
by its ‘ ray ’ to the platform of a cairn at
Clava . This integral relationship could only
be established by excavation
beyond burials and individual monuments . 
Studies from Australia , for example , reveal that
to the aborigines the whole landscape had a
mythical dimension and they in turn inscribed
it with meaning , including the use of rock
carvings . 
The term ‘ ritual landscape ’ to denote a whole
block of land dedicated to gods or spirits was
first coined for Cranborne Chase where the 
7-mile long cursus monument was the focus
for burials over several thousand years . Fieldwalking has revealed more exotic artefacts and
less sign of everyday activity the closer you get
to the cursus . Similar observations have been
made for other Neolithic and Bronze Age
complexes . The way in which many monuments make reference to much earlier ones is
also often very evident . At Ballynahatty a
cluster of monuments around the Giants Ring
appear to be focused on one small passage
grave . 
Green 2000

At Dorchester later monuments respect the line
of the cursus and are aligned on it even though
it would have been barely visible when some of
them were built . Loveday ’ s ( 1998 ) work on
Dorchester suggested that the cursus itself
might have been aligned on a natural feature : a
twin peaked hill known as Mother Dunche ’ s
Buttocks . This illustrates the point that
Neolithic monuments may have related to
places that already had special meaning in
Mesolithic times . The discovery of traces of
earlier structures underneath barrows , as at
Hindwell , adds weight to this idea . 
The study of sacred geography involves
examining the relation between monuments
and landscape and the ways in which the
building of monuments affects the way in
which people may have moved around or
viewed the landscape . Amongst the range of
techniques are studies of intervisibility , which
examine whether monuments were sited in
view of each other . This has been assisted by
the use of GIS and has been particularly
applied to rock art and barrows . Attempting to 
 ‘ read ’ the way monuments structure experience
of the landscape borrows from the sociological
approach known as phenomenology and has
been pioneered in case studies in Britain by
Tilley ( 1994 )  . This approach has led to a
reappraisal of linear monuments . These clearly
structure movement in a particular order and
direction but may themselves be permanent
inscriptions of earlier movements or
processions . Barnett ’ s ( 1998 ) study of the stone
rows on Dartmoor noted how many lead from
the valleys onto the moors , perhaps marking a
route for spirits or the dead . Similar
suggestions have been made for Avebury and
Stonehenge with pathways linking ritual areas
for the living and those of the ancestors . A
powerful concept increasingly used in many
discussions of ritual is liminality . It has been
particularly used in relation to boundaries and
evidence of concentration of ritual activity on
entrances and the margins of settlement areas . 
Tilley 1994
RELIGIOUS SPECIALISTS
In all societies there are certain individuals
especially skilled at contacting and influencing
supernatural beings and manipulating
supernatural forces . They assist or lead other
members of society in their ritual activities . 
160 ■ ARCHAEOLOGY COURSEBOOK
Their qualification for this role may be certain
distinctive personality traits or they may have
undergone special training . A body of myths
may help explain how and why they are
different from those who lack such powers . 
Priests and priestesses
Priests and priestesses are found mostly in
complex societies that can afford to support
full-time specialists of all kinds . He or she will

organisation and given a rank or office similar
to those held before by others . They interpret

Liminal
A boundary , space or time which is literally
between two worlds . It may be between
land and water as at Flag Fen or between
the living and the dead . Liminal areas can
be dangerous and therefore are likely to be
marked by ritual . Most well known ritual
sites have well defined boundaries . 
Figure 8 . 19 Aerial view of the Roman Temple at Uley . The distinctive shape of the main ritual building
on the right with a number of buildings , possibly used as accommodation for pilgrims , beyond it
their wishes or commands for other people but
may also appeal to deities on behalf of
believers . This may be for a fee or for payment
in kind . The priest and recently the priestess
are a familiar figure in western society . Priests
may be recognised archaeologically through
objects placed in burials , through special
equipment and clothing , through literary and
epigraphic evidence and through artistic
evidence of persons involved in ritual activity
such as Shield Jaguar and Lady Xoc 
at Yaxchilan . Their presence could also be
inferred from the structure of monuments from
Stonehenge to medieval churches . In most cases
monuments physically divide people into those
who are in and those who are out , those at the
head of a procession and the followers . 
Shamen
There have been societies without full-time
occupational specialists for much longer than
those in which one finds priests and priestesses . 
However , there have always been individuals
who have individually acquired religious
power . This often happens in isolation and may
involve bodily deprivation , even self-torture , to
try to induce shamanistic visions . It can also
involve trances induced by hallucinogenic
drugs or repetitive dancing and chanting . 
Through contact with a spirit or power , or
visits to the land of the dead these persons
acquire special gifts , such as healing or
divination and the ability to deal with
supernatural beings and powers . When they
return to society they are frequently given
another kind of religious role : that of the 
 ‘ shaman ’  . Faith healers and some evangelists in
our own society are similar in some respects to
this definition of the shaman . 
Definitions of shamanism vary . Some writers
reserve it for Siberian culture but it is widely
applied , particularly to herding , hunter-gatherer
and mobile horticulturist societies . Shamen are
sometimes characterised as magicians rather
than religious leaders . In some situations they
may coexist . Unlike the priest or priestess who
represents deities on earth the shaman is
essentially a religious entrepreneur , who acts
for their client . Sometimes shamen are paid in
kind but usually the increased status that their
activities bring is sufficient reward . 
A shaman in action may put on something of a
show . Frequently shamen enter a trance-like
state in which they can see and interact with
spirit beings ( Lewis-Williams 1988 )  . The
shaman enters a dangerous contest to impose
his or her will on those spirits , as in faith
healing or exorcism . In many groups trancing
is accompanied by conjuring tricks , including
the use of elaborate masks ( for example in the
Pitt-Rivers Museum ) and ventriloquism . 
Shamen know , of course , that they are tricking
people , but at the same time most shamen
really believe in their power to deal with
supernatural powers and spirits . 
The drama of the shaman ’ s performance
promotes a feeling of ecstasy and catharsis 
for the individual members of society . 
Psychological assurance is the key to the 
role of shamanism in society . The shaman 
may claim to be able to manipulate supernatural powers , and promise such things as
protection from enemies , success in love , 
or a cure from some illness or mental 
affliction . This treatment may not be 
effective in any medical sense that we would
acknowledge , but the state of mind induced 
in the patient may nevertheless playa large 
part in his recovery . The shaman may also 
help to maintain social control through the
ability to detect and punish evildoers . This 
can backfire on the shaman . If they are 
162 ■ ARCHAEOLOGY COURSEBOOK
believed to work evil as well as good , or are
unsuccessful , shamen may be driven out of
their group or even killed . 
In societies without iconography shamen are
most likely to be detected through burials . 
Siberian examples have been buried face 
down , tied up and covered with rocks . 
Prehistorians have tried to identify shamen
from burial goods . The Birdlip burial had a
mirror and various amulets including some
made from amber . Originally this was 
classified as a woman ’ s grave but some
researchers have suggested that these goods
may be shamanistic . The Upton Lovell 
burial in Devizes Museum is another such
instance . The goods here include some that 
are similar to those of goldworkers . However , 
metalworking involved ( magical ) transformations and its practitioners are linked 
to divination in many cultures , including 
that of Gypsies .

KEY SKILL
Developing an argument in longer pieces of writing
When faced with an open-ended question it is useful to break it down into manageable chunks . 
A title such as ‘ How far is it possible for archaeologists to identify ritual for your period of
study ?  ’ provides a good example . First , you might want to distinguish between periods that
have written sources and those that do not , although it is a good idea to ask about the
reliability of sources . For the rest , you could subdivide using sub-questions based on the ‘ 4 Ws ’  : 
■ What : can we identify the kind of ritual , which took place ( for example , feasting , 
sacrifice )  ? 
■ Where : can we identify places where ritual took place , how , what evidence and examples ? 
■ Who : can we identify who was involved ( for example , individuals , groups of pilgrims )  ? 
■ Why : can we identify the purpose of the ritual ( ancestor worship , rite of passage , etc .  )  ? 
In each case you will come up with an answer somewhere between yes and no depending on
the techniques used and the quality and survival of evidence . This provides you with a structure
and , taken together , the basis of an argument about the extent to which it is possible to detect
ritual . 
In writing up each section you need to argue . If your tutor keeps writing ‘ assertion ’ on your
work then you are not doing this . You must support each point you make with evidence from
relevant studies . There are several models or gambits for integrating supporting material : 
■ Using authorities to support statements :  ‘  .  .  . as Prior ( 1991 ) demonstrated at Flag Fen ’  . 
■ Cross-referencing :  ‘ The possibility of the Dorset Cursus being used to structure movement
was enhanced by Green ’ s ( 1990 ) discovery of avenues of postholes leading from it to later
round barrows . Analysis of the Stonehenge landscape by Parker Pearson ( 1998 ) also
suggested movement along the avenue between the zones of the living and the ancestors .  ’ 
■ Using evidence to choose between competing versions :  ‘ Renfrew ( 1978 ) suggested that long
barrows might have been territorial markers . Recent studies by Tilley ( 1998 ) and Barnett 
( 1998 ) suggest otherwise . They found that .  .  .  ’ 
■ Juxtaposing evidence to assess it :  ‘ Deposits of cattle bones and smashed pottery near many
entrances may suggest feasting but similar evidence inside is more ambivalent . Is it debris
from feasting , gifts to the ancestors or the remnants of food the dead took with them ?  ’ 
It is useful early on in your course to build up a vocabulary of link words and phrase such as 
 ‘ however ’  ,  ‘ for example ’  ,  ‘ on the other hand ’  . These will prevent you from becoming repetitive
and remind you to always back up your statements . 
Finally you need to conclude . You should revisit the conclusions of each sub-question and see
what the balance of your argument was . Use this to make a tentative ( try to avoid certainty ) 
judgement in response to the main question . 
WHAT DOES THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF
SETTLEMENT COVER ? 
Whether you are studying a range of different
cultures or following a thematic course , 
settlement is likely to be a central topic . 
However , the term itself can mean several
things . 
Today , when we think of settlements we
usually mean cities , towns and villages . 
However , for most of human history none of
these existed . For periods when the population
was mobile rather than sedentary humans
created a range of temporary camps and sites
for processing raw materials and food . 
Sometimes caves or rock shelters were
repeatedly used for occupation and rich
deposits remain . Other sites consist of scatters
of flakes from stone tool making ( debitage ) or
animal bone remains from a butchery site . It is
likely that these people identified with an area
of the landscape , through which they may have
moved on a seasonal basis , rather than living in
one fixed place as we do . 
For many past societies , off-site areas that we
sometimes detect as flint-scatters or field
systems were as important as the ‘ sites ’ which
archaeologists have tended to excavate . The
work of Binford in particular demonstrates that
individual sites can provide a rather biased

KEY TERM
Site
A broad definition is useful here . The term is
applied to field monuments , such as round
barrows , to concealed evidence , such as
cropmarks on aerial photographs , and even to
towns . 
A site is any place where traces of human
activity are found . Usually these traces
include artefacts but depending on the period
studied they might include remains of
structures , faunal remains or modification of
the landscape such as a quarry . Boundaries
make it easier to define sites , but many sites
appear as unenclosed scatters of material . The
recent emphasis on the significance of natural
places in the ritual life of past peoples in the
works of Bradley ( 2000b ) and Tilley ( 1994 ) 
stretches the definition still further . The
duration of use of a site might range from a
few hours for a hunting site to centuries for a
village or town . A settlement is just one type
of site . The specific forms of site will vary
according to period : kill-site , barrow , motte , 
mill , etc .

picture of activity in the past and that there is a
need to consider the whole settlement ‘ system ’  . 
Settlement archaeology , therefore , includes the
study of both permanent and temporary sites
and the interaction of humans with their
landscape in order to understand how they
adapted to it . Human impact on the landscape
from forest clearance to division by boundaries
into territory is therefore a vital part of
settlement study . Archaeologists also try to
understand the ways in which people in the
past understood their landscape through ideas
such as ownership , territory and status . To do
this they need to identify and explain the
spatial distribution of past human activities . 
This might mean understanding the location of
sites within a landscape or the placing of
structures or other features within a settlement . 
At a micro level it includes studying activities
within a room or living floor . The key
questions asked usually revolve around identification of functions or the reasons for patterns
in their distribution . Artefacts , ecofacts and
features are the key evidence base in studying
of distribution of ancient activities .

THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF SETTLEMENT ■ 167
KEY TERM
Sedentary
Essentially sedentary means living in one
place . It used to be thought that huntergatherers were mobile or nomadic and that
people ‘ settled down ’ with the advent of
farming . Evidence from archaeology and
anthropology suggests that the reality is
more complex . Many cultures have existed
whose settlement pattern lies somewhere
between the two poles of mobile and
sedentary . A wealth of terms such as semisedentary , radiating or tethered mobility
have been used to describe these patterns . 
KEY STUDY
Nunamuit ethnoarchaeology
Binford ’ s ( 1978 ) classic ethnoarchaeological research project amongst the
Nunamuit Eskimo examined the dynamics
of their settlement pattern through
seasonal movement from an archaeological
perspective . His studies revealed the huge
range of territory covered and the variable
factors that influenced the location and
timing of campsites . Specialist camps were
established for hunting , carcass processing
and sexual liaisons while non-residential
sites included caches of meat and deadfall
traps . While careful not to draw direct
parallels between Nunamuit and
Palaeolithic hunters , Binford was able to
argue convincingly that since humans do
not confine their behaviour to identifiable
sites , we should study sites as part of a
wider context . Drawing an analogy with
the parts of a car engine he showed that in
order to understand the activities of a
mobile society we need to fit all the parts
of the system together to see the whole
picture , from hunting stands to skinning
sites . Within the sites he put great
emphasis on the spatial relationship
between lithic and bone evidence . 
168 ■ ARCHAEOLOGY COURSEBOOK
KEY TERM
Feature
The term feature is used to describe traces in
the soil of human activity . Sometimes these
are obvious , such as the foundation trenches
of a building or a surviving built structure
such as a kiln . Often the traces are more
fleeting and less easy to interpret . Confusing
masses of postholes and pits are found on
many sites from the Mesolithic onwards . 
A distinction can be made between : 
■ constructed features which were
deliberately built , such as a fish trap or
the postholes of a roundhouse
■ cumulative features , which are the
accidental result of repeated human
activity . The shallow gullies known as drip
rings , which encircle houses , are good
examples , as are holloways . 
Figure 9 . 2 Sites contain , and are made up of , features . This stone-built feature is a kiln or grain dryer

environments , archaeologists hope to
understand how sites developed and were
abandoned , and how people adapted to their
surroundings . To do this , archaeology uses
intensive regional surveys that borrow from
geology , biology and environmental science . 
The land surface
Today ’ s landscape has been shaped by human
and natural activity on top of a geological base . 
Observing the morphology ( shape ) of the
modern landscape is the starting point for
research . Major investigations will also use GIS
to produce digital maps and 3D models of past
environments , for example that of Roman
Wroxeter . 

Projects / BT / default . htm 
However , while the ( post-glacial ) topography
and mineral resources may be similar , much
else is different . Today ’ s environment has been
shaped by many sequences of human activity
on top of a geological base . For the Palaeolithic
and Mesolithic , understanding of geological
changes is essential . For example , sea levels and
the courses of rivers were often radically
different . At Elveden in Suffolk geophysical
survey was used to track ancient river channels
running west-east through a series of narrow
gorges . Today the land is flat and drains northsouth . For most periods , data on soils is
essential both to understand the environment it
may have supported in the past and to track
changes in its composition due to human
activity ( see p . 67 )  . For example , the soils of
many upland areas , including Dartmoor , show
that they were once wooded but that clearance
and agriculture in the Bronze Age contributed
to degradation of the soil and the formation of 
 ‘ iron pans ’ which have prevented their use for
crops since then . Studies of eroded layers of
soil from the highlands of New Guinea around
Kuk Swamp enabled Baylis-Smith ( 1996 ) to
identify the start of slash and burn agriculture
in the surrounding forests . 
The environment
Climatic data can be obtained from
international studies of deep-sea cores , varves
and ice cores . These methods involve the
examination of annual layers , which reflect
climate at the time . In the case of sea cores the
tiny organisms trapped in sediment were
sensitive to contemporary oxygen levels . Strata
of ice laid down at the poles reflect the
temperature and salinity of the ocean at that
time . Varves are layers of sediment at the
bottom of lakes . Their thickness reflects the
extent of annual thawing and the length of
summer . Local climates can be inferred from
ecofacts including animal bones , invertebrates
and plant remains . Pollen is the most widely
used ( see p . 76 )  . Living trees and the type of
plants growing on specific soils can also
provide evidence of past microclimates , for
example , bluebells and oxlips indicate where
ancient woodland stood . 
For more recent periods a wider range of
evidence becomes available . The texts by
Aston , Fleming and Muir in the bibliography
provide a wealth of examples . Their research
has revealed that earlier patterns of land use are
often fossilised within today ’ s pattern of fields
and woods . Some boundaries may date back to
at least Roman times and the hedges that mark
some of them may be almost as old . The names
of fields also provide clues to what the land
was used for . For example , assart refers to land
cleared from woodland , wick and chester to
settlements .

THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF SETTLEMENT ■ 169
Seasonality
Ecofacts have been used on many transitory
sites to identify periods of occupation . The
settlement patterns around the Palaeolithic sites
of Ambrona and Torralba were identified by
the bones of migratory birds while occupation
periods of the Mesolithic midden at Cnoc Coig
were estimated from the ear bones or otoliths
of fish . These methods are not without
controversy . The antlers found at Star Carr
have been used to argue for its use in almost
every season . 
IDENTIFYING HUMAN USE OF THE

The term ‘ cultural ecology ’ has been used to
describe the relationship between people and
landscape . Humans are part of the ecosystem
like other living organisms and climate ,

Hayley Wood
Rackham ’ s ( 1990 ) study drew on estate
documents from the fourteenth century
onwards and fieldwork to show how this
ash and hazel woodland was managed as a
renewable crop . Timbers were felled and
replanted on a thirty-year cycle and
coppiced on a seven-year rotation . His
work demonstrates the range of evidence
available to the woodland archaeologist
including monuments , banks and the trees

they live . However , unlike that of other
mammals , human movement around and use of
the landscape cannot be explained solely in
terms of biology and the physical environment . 
Humans adapt to their environment through
the use of cultural technology . They can extend
the range of resources and territory they
exploit beyond their natural biological limits
by , for example , harvesting sea fish through the
development of boats , traps and nets during the
Mesolithic or using irrigation to farm arid
areas . To understand the dynamics of human
adaptation , archaeologists need to understand
both the environment of the area studied and
the technology available to the people living
there . Humans can also modify their
environment . Human fertility is not just
determined by the carrying capacity of the land
as the modern world demonstrates . However , 
the relationship is complex as archaeology can
demonstrate . The collapse of the Mesopotamian
civilisation at Mashkan Shapir provides a classic
example . The city prospered in a desert area
through the development of irrigation and the
construction of a network of canals . At one
time the city was also a port . Unfortunately
irrigation contributed to the rapid salination of
the soil . Crop yields collapsed and the civilisation crumbled . This process of human change
provoking environmental change is referred to
as feedback . Flannery ( 1976 ) identified an
example of positive feedback in his study of the
Oaxaca Valley in Mexico . His study showed
how mobile foragers had encouraged the
spread of a type of grass , which was to develop
into maize . Maize flourished and as the average
size of maize cobs grew , it became a major
component of human diets . Maize was able to
support a higher density and more sedentary
human population than previously . Eventually
this meant that there could not be a return to a
foraging existence and dependency on maize
agriculture increased .

Site catchment analysis
In the 1970s archaeologists interested in
understanding how humans exploited their
environment and the extent of settlement 
 ‘ territories ’ borrowed a range of analytical
techniques from economic geography . 
Prominent amongst these was site catchment
analysis . This assumes that settlements were
not located randomly across the landscape , but
were sited to maximise efficiency and minimise
effort in gathering resources . By walking and
analysing the area around a site , archaeologists
tried to identify the resources its inhabitants
would have been able to exploit and therefore
understand its location . Ethnographic studies
of site exploitation territories were used to
determine the distance people might travel for
subsistence resources . For instance , foragers
such as the ! Kung bushmen of the Kalahari
rarely walk more than 10 kilometres ( about 2
hours walk ) from their base with a range of
20–30 kilometres to other sites with whom
they traded and areas they occasionally visited , 
for example for building materials , clay or
summer pasture . Studies of peasant farmers
suggest that their normal limit is just 5
kilometres . Although models tend to feature
circular territories around sites , in reality they
would reflect local topography . This was the
case with pioneering studies of early farmers in
coastal Palestine . 
Site catchment analysis can help understand the
economic potential of a territory and perhaps
generate ideas about population levels by
estimating the carrying capacity of the land . It
also provides a model , which can be compared
with archaeological evidence such as food , 
remains , pollen and artefacts . Human remains

can also provide some dietary information as to
which resources were particularly exploited 
( see p . 72 )  . Similar ideas can be used to
understand settlements in the historic period . 
Mick Aston ’ s study of Ashington in Somerset 
( 1985 ) uses the idea of site catchment to
illuminate the way the settlement and others
like it in Somerset organised its exploitation of
the local environment . Resources needed on a
daily basis were produced in or close to the
settlement with less frequently needed
resources located further out . Aston ’ s book
Interpreting the landscape also shows how the
landscape can be used as a text to read off past
activities and relationships . 
Plants are good indicators of local environments because we know the conditions that the
various species can tolerate . Analysis of plant
samples from sites can provide insights into the 
 ‘ catchment area ’ beyond the immediate locality
with people introducing plants into the site
through plant collecting or cultivation or by
accident . For example , Otzi the Ice Man was
found to have cereal grains adhering to his
grass cape . To have value the archaeologist
must study very carefully the formation
processes that led to the creation of the deposit
which contains the plant remains under consideration . A good example of this sort of study
was the analysis of weed seeds in the plant
remains at Danebury . Weeds , like food crops , 
prefer specific soil conditions , such as wet
lowland valleys or higher chalk pastures . From
the types of weed present archaeologists were
able to infer the soil conditions in which the
main crops were grown before being brought
into the hill fort . This information meant that
the catchment area of Danebury in terms of
agriculture was more clearly understood and
future research could be focused on the soil
types contributing to this overall assemblage . 
However , site catchment analysis has serious
limitations . It depends on accurate
reconstruction of ancient landscapes , which is
difficult since traces of changes in much of the
flora and fauna may not have survived . It
assumes that people in the past were aware of
and could access the resources we can identify
today . It also assumes that their behaviour was
economically ‘ normal ’  . That is , they sought to
maximise returns for the least effort . Finally , it
is a rather deterministic model of human
behaviour . It may well be that spiritual , cultural
or political considerations were as important
factors in decisions about site placement as
economics . Even so , the method is valuable in
exploring potential site use and in forming
hypotheses to be tested against archaeological
data . 
Studying spatial distribution
The distribution pattern of sites and
settlements across a landscape has the potential
to tell us a great deal about the interaction
between people and environment and the
nature of social organisation . The first stage is
to plot known sites of similar dates on a map
and then add aerial and surface survey results if
they are available . The distribution can then be
analysed for signs of patterns , clustering , and
relationships between larger and smaller sites . 
GIS is particularly useful here . Once the data is
inputted , queries can relate sites to a wide
range of factors including soils , water and
intervisibility . 
Describing the pattern is easier than explaining
it . Various types of cluster analysis have been
used to test archaeological site distribution
against geographical models of distribution .

THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF SETTLEMENT ■ 173
KEY STUDY
Ethnoarchaeology of modern camps in the Kalahari
Kent ’ s ( 1989 ) ethnoarchaeological study of modern sites in the Kalahari tested the importance
of site catchment in determining difference in size , complexity and period of occupation
between different settlements . She compared the camps of different groups of farmers and
foragers to see whether ethnicity or a major source of subsistence was critical , and was able to
talk to the people themselves about their behaviour . There was a marked variability of data but
it could largely be explained by social factors , for example the layout and range of features
was determined by how long people expected to remain at the site . 
KEY STUDY
Mesolithic hunters of the
Trentino
Clark ( 2000 ) examined the
connection between site
location and subsistence
strategy in the mountains of
Northern Italy over a long
period . Animal bone and lithic
tools from well-preserved
deposits in rock shelters were
used to determine the type of
hunting practised . In the early
Mesolithic summer hunting
sites at high altitude had been
used to catch ibex and
chamois with hunting bands
retreating to lower rock
shelters in the winter . 
In the late Mesolithic the high level sites were abandoned and a range of resources were
exploited in the lower woods and river valleys . Bone assemblages suggested whole carcasses
were being brought to the shelter rather than selected joints removed in the field . This decrease
in hunting territories coincided with an increase in forest cover which reduced the high level
pasture . Human adaptation included a shift in prey and the adoption of a range of tools suited
to forest hunting .

Central place theory ( CPT ) based on the
modelling of Christaller assumes that as the
landscape fills up , settlements will be spaced
evenly throughout it . Where settlements are
more or less of equal size this reflects a fairly
equal society . Where there is considerable
variation in size it reflects a hierarchical society
and one where the larger places perform central
functions and provide a wider range of goods
on behalf of a cluster of smaller satellite
settlements . These will also emerge at regular
intervals across the landscape . The most
efficient pattern of spacing is a hexagonal lattice
so areas for each central place are modelled by
drawing hexagons around them . A study of
medieval English market towns found that they
fitted this model quite well . Each town was 4–6
miles from its neighbours and served a cluster
of satellite hamlets and farmsteads . Thiessen
polygons have been used in similar ways . 
These are created by joining up the midpoints
between settlements , to form irregular shaped
zones of influence and exploitation . 
These methods can be used to generate
hypotheses to test about territory or
catchment . CPT could also be used to suggest
where there might be undiscovered sites . Such
models have been used in a variety of regional
studies including predicting the influence of
Roman towns and changing social organisation
in Iron Age Wessex . Cunliffe ( 1995 ) noted that
a wide distribution of hill forts gave way to
fewer , larger hill forts later in the first
millennium . He interpreted this as representing
a wider scale of social organisation with the
development of tribal chiefdoms . A similar
approach was used by Renfrew ( 1973 ) who
interpreted the distribution of long barrows on
Arran as reflecting the territories of groups of

THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF SETTLEMENT ■ 175
KEY STUDY
Early medieval settlement in the
Cotswolds
Between the decline of Roman towns and
villas and the emergence of known villages by
the eleventh century , settlement patterns are
hard to detect . The absence of dateable
ceramics from the archaeological record
means that fieldwalking ’ s contribution is
unusually limited and there has been no major
excavation of a village . Reece ’ s ongoing study 
( 1998 ) focuses on the possibility that
hedgerows may be indicative of past
settlement locations . They would have been
used to separate arable land from pasture
and trackways and would be expected to
occur along tracks and within a doughnutshaped zone around settlement . Through
examination of the species in hedges Reece
has found that periods in which hedge
management lapses will lead to domination by
a few species and the elimination of some
which grow more slowly . So the Hooper
method may underestimate the age of the
oldest hedges . He has used evidence of
particular species such as wayfaring tree and
guelder rose to suggest which might be the
oldest hedges . Comprehensive mapping of
richer ( older ) hedges may help identify lost
settlement . 
pioneer farmers . He found that the areas of
land involved were similar to the holdings of
modern crofts . 
These idealised models tend to minimise the
contribution of social and cultural influences
and the influence of topography . CPT fits all
known sites into one of the categories in a
hierarchy of sites , which may not be realistic . 
A single pattern of settlement may be the
physical expression of many different social
systems . Belief , social relations and political
considerations can be significant . For example , 
the distribution of Roman towns could reflect
administrative areas for tax and law and order
as well as the influence of markets . Some 
small sites may also have a social or ritual
importance , which means they are of major
importance in their region . One has to be
confident that all the plotted features are
related ( for example contemporary ) and also
that no significant ones have been omitted . 
If not , the analysis is of the results of archaeological discoveries rather than of decisions
made in the past . The key point is that these
are models . Their primary function should be
in helping generate questions and hypotheses
that can be tested against archaeological data
rather than fitting data to a model . 
The social landscape : territory and
boundaries
Of course , many social territories include many
sites and are not obviously shaped by
geography . Spatial distribution is of little use in
explaining the British Empire of the nineteenth
century although another geographical model , 
world systems theory , is useful in helping
understand its workings . For state societies , 
written records often exist which help to
identify centres and their territories . Roman
inscriptions and the stone stelae of the Maya
have both been used in this way . For some
states the extent of political control is indicated
by physical boundaries . Hadrian ’ s Wall and the
Great Wall of China are well known from the
ancient world but during the twentieth century
fortified borders became the norm for nation
states . The ruins of France ’ s Maginot Line and
the ‘ Iron Curtain ’ dividing East and West
Europe provide classic examples . Less certainty
surrounds the purpose of early medieval
earthworks such as Offa ’ s Dyke or Wansdyke . 
Artefacts of administration also provide clues
to territories and the influence of central
authorities . These include clay seals , emblems , 
standard weights and measures and coinage . 
However , influence and territory are not
identical . Well-recognised currencies were used
in the past outside their area of issue just as the
US dollar is today . The evidence may be

Bronze Age zones of influence in
Wessex
Most sites known from late Bronze Age
Wessex are small farmsteads . However , 
there were also several large hilltop
enclosures such as Rams Hill . Ellison ’ s 
( 1980 ) study examined the distribution of
a range of artefacts across southern
England to see whether the patterns
related to these sites . She found that they
were positioned on the edge of the distribution of two or more types of finer
pottery and seemed to be central to the
distribution of metal ornaments . She
concluded that they were centres for
exchange and probably also for a
developing social and political hierarchy .

KEY SKILL
Using case studies effectively
Case studies are detailed examples that will
provide the evidence that supports your
answer . The key sites and key studies used
throughout this book are case studies and
indicate the amount of detail you may
eventually need to use . To reach the higher
levels in any mark scheme you must use case
studies . They are often the difference between
a grade D and grade B response at A Level . 
It is a good idea to build up a portfolio of
case studies throughout the course , covering
each of the major topics . 
Finding case studies
Your teacher will provide you with a base set
of case studies but you should supplement this
through your own research . There are many
rich sources of additional material including
television , museums and newspapers , as well
as the sort of texts and websites listed in this
book . Whatever your area of interest in
archaeology there will be case studies
available . 
How to note case studies
The main points here are to avoid copying
down large chunks of information and to keep
in mind your purpose . You are likely to find
case studies as you research one piece of
work , but need to consider what other
questions you might be asked in the future
which they could also help with . It is sensible
to adopt a thematic approach as used in the
Stellmoor example on p . 204 , breaking the
study up into components . There are many
ways to do this from simple highlighting of
the original or sets of keywords and concepts
to elaborate cross-referenced , illustrated and
colour-coded separate notes . You should use
whichever system you find the most effective
for retaining useable data . Experience has
shown that the following work well : 
■ Condense the factual content to one third
or less of the original , emphasising
keywords and concepts that will trigger
recall of data in an examination situation . 
■ Extract phrases and quotations but keep
them punchy and brief . 
■ Use illustrations and diagrams when they
convey a concept more effectively than
you could do with words . 
■ Use the ‘ list ’ or ‘ brainstorming ’ method 
( see p . 193 ) to give consistency and
information at a glance . 
■ Use highlighters sparingly in your own
notes and never on the original ! 
■ Use colour to code for methodology and
for each of the big themes , perhaps six
colours in all . 
Managing case studies
As your folder grows it is easy to lose track
of material . You should track this material 
by using a grid such as the one below . Enter
the name of each site in the left-hand column
and then indicate key aspects of the site
which relate to the themes you are studying
and which you may be examined upon . The
grid is set up for the AQA course . This grid
could usefully function as an index in your
folder and help you to make links between
themes . 
contradictory in other ways . Zones of pottery
and coin distribution have often not matched
up . For early periods there may have been
markers of territory which have not survived . 
These might have included totems or the
appearance of peoples themselves . 
On a local level , the landscape can also be used
to explore power and status . The position of
powerful social institutions such as churches
and country houses are often prominent in the
landscape . The traces of deserted villages on
land cleared for sheep pasture in the sixteenth
century or for deer parks in the eighteenth
century provide insights into local control . 
Studies such as that at Shapwick ( see p . 15 ) 
have revealed the way that the apparently
natural distribution of villages nestling in the
countryside was often a medieval creation . 
Powerful estate owners reorganised the
landscape , creating nucleated villages from
scattered farmsteads to maximise control and
profitability . Modern field patterns strongly
reflect the enclosure movement of the early
nineteenth century , which was pursued for
similar reasons .

IDENTIFYING THE FUNCTION ( S ) OF
ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITES
Archaeological sites are usually categorised by
function . Generally this is a matter of
determining the primary function since most
sites have several . A castle is primarily
defensive but may also have a domestic , 
economic and political function as well as being
a status symbol . The same point could also be
made about individual buildings . 
Archaeologists therefore try and identify what
activities were carried out and whether there
are any significant patterns in the evidence that
might indicate that those particular spaces 
( areas , buildings or rooms ) had specific
functions . For example , was food preparation
separated from storage ? Taken together these
enable the functions of the site to be described

and assessed to determine their relative
importance . 
Evidence of human activities varies widely
according to period , degree of preservation and
the resources available to the excavators . If a
site is from a historic period there may be
written accounts , artistic depictions , plans and
for the last few centuries maps , photographs , 
film and even living people ! This is clearly not
the case with much of prehistory . While there
are cave sites and rock shelters with deep
deposits of cultural material that have been
sheltered from erosion , these sites are not
typical . Most Palaeolithic sites have been
subject to the ravages of a full range of
transformation processes ( see p . 95 ) and any
interpretation has to take these into account . 
The main evidence for most sites will come
from the archaeological record resulting from
excavation or reconnaissance survey . 
Archaeologists will then try to recognise and
explain patterns in the data . This relies on the
comprehensiveness and accuracy of excavation
recording ( see p . 43 ) for its validity . 
How are different types of activity
identified on archaeological sites ? 
Boundaries such as internal and external walls , 
fence alignments or ditches are usually
intended to separate different activities . This
applies equally to a room , a farm or a town . 
Clear demarcation with boundaries makes
detecting patterns of finds or space and
comparing finds and features in different areas
easier than on open sites . Where boundaries are
identified , their shape , size and orientation can
provide indications to their use although
analogies will be needed to interpret them . 
Certain shapes and patterns ( for example 
 ‘ four-posters ’ or ‘ church shapes ’  ) may occur
frequently . This enables interpretation of
features on new sites with reference to
identified examples from known ones ( for
example , comparing Roman features with 
well-preserved examples from sites such as
Pompeii )  . Shapes of buildings and patterns can
also be detected from detailed aerial
photographs or by remote sensing . Archaeologists use their experience and data from
excavation reports to identify connected groups
of features . For example , a particular group of
holes might be suggested as the postholes of a
house from similarities in size , depth , fill , date
and because the archaeologist recognises their
pattern . Other evidence will be examined to see
if the interpretation can be corroborated . 

silchester / 
Association of artefacts and other finds with
particular areas is the most common archaeological method . Detailed three-dimensional
plotting of the distribution of finds across
entire excavations enables patterns of activity to
be identified . Examples include clusters of hide
or bone working flints or the association of
particular artefacts with particular features such

KEY STUDIES
Interpreting Iron Age hill
forts
Early studies of hill forts
often started with classical
sources and looked for
evidence to support those
historical accounts . Caesar
had described chiefs and the
warlike nature of the Celts . 
Hill forts with their massive
defensive earthworks and
evidence of violence at some
of them , for example Hod
Hill , looked to many like the
strongholds of powerful
chiefdoms . Cunliffe ’ s
excavations at Danebury
seemed to support this view . 
The large number of storage
pits and possible ‘ four poster ’ granaries could be interpreted as evidence of foodstuff stockpiled
by a chief for redistribution or exchange . Other research has called this view into question . 
Danebury is still an impressive site today and undoubtably the resources that went into its
construction would have given it a special status . However , there does not appear to be
evidence of high status housing . Sharples ’ investigation of Maiden Castle also found little
difference in size or artefacts between the mass of huts concentrated inside its massive
earthworks . In many respects it is just a large farming community . 
Hill ( 1996 )  , in a series of attacks on Cunliffe ’ s view of the Iron Age undertook statistical
analysis of the ratios of finds to cubic metres of soil excavated on a range of Iron Age sites . 
While Danebury produced more finds , more soil was trowelled to produce them than on other
sites . Comparison of the ratio of finds to volume of spoil suggested that Danebury was
unexceptional in its density of craft tools . Several farmsteads such as Winnall Down produced
higher densities of many finds . Hill used this kind of data to argue for a less hierarchical Iron
Age . He also focused on the unenclosed and often ‘ richer ’ sites of the nearby Thames Valley to
question the warlike nature of the period . Collis ’  ( 1996 ) work provides a further insight . He
views hill forts principally as enclosures and sets them into a tradition of special hilltop
enclosures in southern England stretching back to the early Neolithic . Nobody is suggesting
that they were never used for defence and never occupied by a powerful leader , just that those
may not have been their sole or principal functions . 
Figure 9 . 7 Aerial photograph of the massive ramparts of

and complex entrances look defensive , but they may have had

as loom weights in a hut doorway . However , 
one has to be careful not to assign function on
the basis of a few finds . 
Computers make sophisticated density analysis
possible such as comparing ratios of finds to
area or volume of earth excavated . This can
suggest which areas were most used for
particular activities and may counter the bias
created by large finds or raw numbers of finds . 
Similar analysis has been used on pits to
suggest that they were not used solely for
refuse disposal . 
Areas with few finds present more of a
challenge . The apparent deliberate clearing or 
 ‘ purification ’ of an area can be a signature of
ritual activity ( for example the ditch at
Avebury or the Zapotec temples of San Jose
Mogote )  . However , absence of finds alone

KEY STUDIES
Palaeolithic assemblages
For the Palaeolithic , assemblages of
artefacts and faunal remains are often the
key to determining function . The ‘ living
floors ’ of Olduvai Gorge and Koobi Fora in
East Africa with their dense concentration
of stone tools and animal bones have been
much debated . Archaeologists who took
these assemblages at face value tended to
see these as kill sites or base camps where
groups of hunters butchered carcasses or
shared meat from their prey . This idea has
been challenged on the grounds that the 
 ‘ sites ’ were unsafe for humans and that
microscopic analysis of the bones suggests
that humans scavenged the bones after
other predators had processed them . 
Further studies have questioned whether
we should consider these as ‘ sites ’ at all . 
Taphonomic studies of bone distributions
from predator kills and experimental work
on site formation processes affecting tools
and bones in the region suggest that the
sites might be palimpsests , that is , 
accumulations of material from different
times caused by natural forces as well as
human activity .

KEY TERM
Signature
To help identify features and their
functions , archaeologists use mental
templates for common activities in the
period they are studying . There will be
certain recurring patterns at sites , which
have already been studied , which are
associated with particular activities . For
example , fires or hearths usually colour the
earth reddish-orange while smelting or
metalworking leaves slag and other waste
products . 
Alternative inferences can be made
through the use of analogies drawn from
experimental archaeology , ethnography and
ethnoarchaeology ( see p . 102 )  . 
THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF SETTLEMENT ■ 181
should not be taken as proof of ritual purification ! 
Analysis of soils or other environmental
evidence has been used successfully on some
sites to determine activity . Phosphate or heavy
mineral analysis can indicate where animals
have been penned and there is some suggestion
that different animals may have different
chemical ‘ signatures ’  . Other environmental data
including the remains of invertebrates with
specific habitats can also provide clues . For
example , grain beetles were used to identify
particular buildings as granaries in Roman
York . 
The immediate context of a site can also
provide clues to its general function and the
activities that may have occurred there . A site
surrounded by arable fields is likely to have
had areas for processing and storing crops
while evidence of watercourses may help to
identify the remains of a building as a mill . 
This is least easy to do in towns where a
picture of overall patterns can only be built up
over a long time through a series of ‘ keyhole ’ 
excavations . 
There are , of course , limits to the conclusions
that can be drawn about any site . 
Archaeologists are usually investigating at the
end of lengthy post-depositional processes and
need to understand the impact of these on the
evidence . For example , is it a site or a
palimpsest ? Partial survival , partial recovery , 
accuracy of find identification and the quality
of sampling will also influence what is there to
be studied , for example not all excavations will
have recovered environmental evidence . 
Beyond this there is the quality of the insights
and interpretations of the archaeologists . While
the above provide clues , other insights will be
needed to interpret them and test ideas . 
Analogies can be drawn from experimental
archaeology , ethnography and
ethnoarchaeology ( see p . 103 )  . Studying
patterns of deposition from known activities
may reveal signatures , which can help unravel
evidence from the past . Conclusions will also
reflect the values and assumptions of the
archaeologists as well as their skill and
knowledge . This is even more significant if one
hopes to identify areas associated with
particular gender , status or age groups .

THE USE OF SPACE ON
ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITES
The reasons why sites within the same area
differ in their internal layout have been
explored by archaeologists drawing on ethnoarchaeology . Binford ’ s work with the Nunamiut 
( see p . 167 ) provided insights into the
complex reasons for differences . He showed
that it was wrong to expect the same group of
people to produce homogeneous sites . Sites
differed due to their role in the overall
settlement system . For example , hunting and
residential sites used space differently , but even
hunting camps might differ widely . The site of
a successful hunt might generate many additional activities to the site of an unsuccessful
one . 
Ethnoarchaeology has identified some of the
problems that can occur if the distribution of
artefacts and features on a site are interpreted
as a direct record of economic decisions and
activities . Site maintenance , the practice of
disposing of rubbish , may create misleading
patterns in the archaeological record . Different
materials are treated differently , some being
thrown aside while others are recycled or
deliberately taken to dumps . Some activities are
deliberately sited to be near heat and light
while tasks that require a lot of space are rarely
in areas where people socialise . In Clarke ’ s 
( 1972 ) study of Glastonbury Lake Village he
used artefactual evidence in relation to spaces
marked by boundaries to identify a series of
zones which went beyond economic activity . 
Distinct compounds for carpentry , leather and
iron working were identified and interpreted as
male working areas while zones for spinning
and baking were interpreted as female areas . 
Clarke also identified some differences in the
value of artefacts in different huts , which he
saw as evidence of a ranked society with
differences in wealth . 
The distribution of activities can be most
clearly seen where buildings remain . Distinctive
features such as ovens , drains and traces of
fixings provide important clues . Decorative
features , the size of the room and the nature of
doors and windows provide hints to both

KEY TASK
Linking signatures to sites
To familiarise yourself with these concepts
and the issues relating to identifying
settlement function for the period ( s ) you
are studying , produce your own version of
the signature diagram ( Figure 9 . 8 )  . This
will provide a useful aide-memoir for when
you write evaluative essays on this topic . 
■ Insert three or four additional , relevant
categories in boxes , for example
military site , port , extraction site and
high status site . 
■ Enter one or two sites from your study
in each of the boxes , for example
Boxgrove as an example of a butchery
site . You may find that some sites fit
several categories . 
■ Around the box list indicators of
function which could serve as
signatures from these sites . 
■ Finally , try to identify any problems
you have encountered such as contradictory or ambivalent evidence . For
example , some archaeologists have
identified Neolithic houses as dwellings , 
others as ritual structures . It is
possible that they had several
functions . 
function and status . Surviving buildings also
enable greater exploration of the social use of
space than on excavated sites . This involves
analysis of what the use of space meant and
how social relations were structured by the
architecture . For example , the household is the
fundamental organisational unit for most
known societies but there are exceptions where
more extended social groups live under one
roof . Physical space between clusters of huts
may represent social distance while a building
that physically dominates others may be the
home of a social leader . The architecture of the
houses reflects this differentiation . This type of
analysis has been applied to the search for
ritual specialists ( see p . 161 ) and investigations of gender relations . Gilchrist ( 1995 ) has
suggested that the layout of domestic areas of
medieval castles reflects and reinforces contemporary views on the differences between men
184 ■ ARCHAEOLOGY COURSEBOOK
KEY STUDIES
The Mask site and Pincevent
Binford ’ s observations of behaviour and
the use of space around a hearth by
Nunamuit caribou hunters at the Mask site
have been particularly influential . He
identified an irregular doughnut-shaped
distribution of material . He divided this
into drop and toss zones according to the
way the hunters disposed of rubbish . For
example , larger pieces of debris were
thrown behind the hunters or across the
fire . He was able to detect differences in
distribution patterns caused by differing
numbers of hunters . He also noted that
hearths tended to be spread by people
searching for food in the ashes and that
when the wind changed direction , the
hunters would turn around and start
another hearth . Binford contrasted this
behaviour with observations inside
structures where hearths and resulting ash
are usually surrounded by stones to
prevent the spread of fire and to provide
working surfaces . People also tend not to
throw rubbish over their shoulders indoors . 
Binford ( 1983 ) used these insights to
challenge Leroi-Gourhan ’ s ( 1978 ) interpretation of the Upper Palaeolithic site of
Pincevent . Excavation here had revealed
rings of stone associated with a number of
hearths . Leroi-Gourhan had interpreted
these as tents with the stones used to hold
the edges of the tents down . Binford
suggested that it was an open-air site with
the stones used to hold down hides for
working on . People built new hearths in
response to changes in wind direction . 
KEY STUDY
Black Patch
Drewett ’ s ( 1982 ) excavation of part of
this Bronze Age farmstead drew on
ethnography and detailed analysis of
different categories of finds to suggest the
functions and social organisation of the
site . The largest hut , which had its own
compound and pond and contained finer
pottery and evidence of a loom , was the
home of the headman . The smaller huts
were for food preparation , storage and
accommodation for the rest of the
headman ’ s extended family . Detailed study
of finds within the huts was related to
likely sources of light to identify areas for
weaving , leather working and storage .

Gurness
Brochs are double-walled , drystone tower houses surrounded by clusters of other buildings . 
Recent studies of this Iron Age broch on Orkney by Historic Scotland have challenged the idea
that it was simply a defensive site . The great tower of the broch dominated the settlement and
the smaller houses were ranged either side of the single passage leading into the broch itself . 
The architecture controlled movement around the site and constantly drew attention to the
tower . The broch provided a home to a chieftain and protection for his followers . However , it
also made his dominance of the people and the area visible . In helping to build it and living
under its shadow the local people accepted his authority .

and women . In the analysis of space , 
boundaries are of particular importance and
archaeologists are careful not to see ditches and
entrances as simply functional . 
On a larger scale the differing size and
elaboration of buildings may suggest a
stratified society while controlling elites might
be inferred from settlements structured along
gridlines or with fixed orientations . The layout
of Teotihuacan in Mexico is an example where
the existence of a directing elite can be substantiated from other evidence . 
The status of different sites is also determined
by examining patterns . Elite sites or buildings
are expected to be larger and richer in finds and
decoration than humbler versions . Key features
such as unusually large storage facilities and

KEY SITE
West Heslerton
Around AD 450 a typical Romano-British settlement which had been joined by distinctive
Anglo-Saxon grubenhaus was abandoned .  ( see p . 132 ) A short distance away a large , new
settlement replaced it . This too combined Romano-British and Anglo-Saxon elements but was a
very different settlement . It included post and plank built buildings and a long hall . The whole
site was laid out in an ordered way with distinct zones for farming , housing and industrial
activity . The evidence of buildings and pottery suggested much continuity of population but the
planning and Scandinavian origin of the larger buildings suggested that the site had new , 
foreign leaders . 
Figure 9 . 13 Wooden structures rarely survive . They have to be ‘ constructed ’ from traces left in
the earth from their construction . This grubenhaus from West Heslerton illustrates this point . 
Experiment ( see p . 102 ) will be needed to interpret the superstructure of the building
exotic finds are also indicators of status . The
Minoan capital Knossos provides a good
example of this . Extensive permanent storage
and valuable finds from throughout the eastern
Mediterranean testify to its importance . 
UNDERSTANDING STRUCTURES
Many of the points made in relation to sites
and features also apply to structures , but you
also need to understand how archaeologists
interpret structures from buried traces . Key
questions revolve around why particular
designs were selected and the technology and
materials used to construct them . Structures
range from traces of a windbreak around a
hearth or stakeholes from a tent through to
recent industrial or military buildings . Faced
with pits , slots and postholes , archaeologists
have to make imaginative leaps to reconstruct
buildings from the past . Early examples
reflected modern perceptions of people in the
past or were drawn from ethnography .

laboratory for testing ideas about Iron Age
technology including farming and the
effectiveness of tools . Its buildings are
designed according to the floorplans of
excavated sites . The walls , beams and roof
itself are the product of experimentation
based on knowledge of Iron Age carpentry
and engineering . Building roundhouses has
enabled the exploration of ideas about roof
slope , light , efficiency of fires and whether
a smoke hole is needed . It has also
answered questions about how long a
roundhouse might last and the amount of
woodland needed to build and maintain it . 

Figure 9 . 15 An Iron Age roundhouse at
Butser Ancient Farm .  ‘ Constructs ’ such
as this have been immensely valuable in
exploring many aspects of past buildings
including roof shape , potential function , 
construction techniques and useful
lifetime
The development of experimental archaeology
has been particularly important in investigating
structures from prehistoric and medieval times . 
While ground plans can be estimated from
hearths and postholes or foundation trenches , 
the walls and roofs are problematic . However , 
we have developed an understanding of
building and materials from sites with unusual
preservation . Woodworking capabilities from
the Mesolithic onwards have been informed by
finds at waterlogged sites such as the Sweet
Track in Somerset . They have provided insights
into construction techniques , tools and the type
of wood used and have hinted at the extent of
woodland management . Experimental
structures such as those at West Stow ( see 
p . 131 ) and Butser Ancient Farm have used this
information to test hypotheses about the design
and materials used to make the walls and roofs
and then about the use and function of the
buildings . It is important to remember that
while everyone refers to these buildings as
reconstructions they cannot be reconstructions . 
We cannot be entirely sure what an Iron Age

THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF SETTLEMENT ■ 189
Figure 9 . 16 Reconstruction of Central European mammoth bone house . A number of sites have been
excavated in central Europe and the Ukraine dating from the Upper Palaeolithic with large quantities of
carefully arranged mammoth bones . Although there is some controversy over the nature of possible
structures , the dominant interpretation is that modern human hunters used the tusks , long bones and
skulls of mammoths as substitutes for wood in contructing huts . Skins were probably tied over the bones
to provide weatherproof shelter . If accurate , this provides a classic example of human adaptability in
harsh climatic conditions . It may also indicate a very specialised economy
roof was like , so modern versions should
properly be called constructs or models . 
Similarly we cannot know if the house was
decorated or whether people slept on the
ground or on platforms that lay across the roof
beams . Experiment can only show what might
have been and then test it to failure . 
Experimental archaeology is , of course , 
weighted towards technological understanding . 
There may be social or religious reasons for
particular designs and materials being used
which reconstructions cannot directly address . 
Therefore other sources of analogy and analysis
of the symbolism of designs are also studied . 
The predominant orientation of Bronze and
Iron Age roundhouses and enclosures towards
the south-east may be such a case . Experiment
has shown that a southerly orientation would
maximise light . The choice of south-east or
west may reflect beliefs linked to the rising or
setting sun . 
Where archaeologists are investigating standing
buildings a wide range of insights can be gained
into the technical skills , communications and
prosperity of the societies and individuals that
created them . For instance , petrological
examination ( see p . 62 ) to identify the
sources of building stone used for Roman villas
or medieval cathedrals tells us about contemporary geological knowledge and hints at the
nature of markets for materials and the
transport system necessary to move them .

Planning successful archaeology essays
For essays in any subject the same essential rules apply . Accurate statements well linked to the
question and supported by relevant and detailed examples lead to success . Essays are generally
marked according to ‘ levels-of-response mark schemes ’  . This means that the markers will have
a hierarchical series of statements that describe essays . Each statement or band has a range of
marks allocated to it . Generally , speaking , the first third of the mark range are for descriptive
accounts or essays that argue but provide no evidence . These are fails . The second third
combine the two and are low-level passes . The top level requires arguments well supported with
case study material . Often the mark awarded within a band is influenced by the amount of
relevant detail . The commonest reasons for underperformance are not supporting your
statements and being irrelevant . To avoid this , most successful students plan their essays . 
A plan can help you to : 
■ focus on what you need to do
■ make sure you include all key points
■ avoid wasting time on irrelevant points .

The three stages of essay planning
Skeleton Muscles Flesh
Basic structure Paragraph content Depth and detail
Order of points Major ideas Content from case studies
Levels of importance Links backward and forward Theoretical concepts
Having planned what you need to
include , you then need to write up
the essay with a logical and
appropriate structure . There is no
single right way to do this . You will
need to vary your response with
different types of question . 
Archaeology essays follow three
broad patterns : 
■ List-type essays that ask you to
focus on a process or methods . 
For example , what can archaeologists learn from human soft
tissue remains ? 
■ Evaluative essays , which ask you
to weigh up how far something
can be supported by evidence . 
For example , how far is it
possible to identify settlement in
the Mesolithic ? 
■ Discursive essays ask you to explore all sides of an issue and reach a conclusion . They are
often posed as a quotation followed by the instruction ‘ Discuss ’  . You can respond to these
with an argument but you do need to consider other interpretations as well as your own . 
While these require different structures in the body of the essay , there are several common
points , which you could use as a checklist . 
1 Introduction
■ Define terms mentioned in the title . 
■ Outline types of sources to be used . 
■ Make a statement about the issue in the question , even if it is pointing out that there are
several dimensions to it . 
Model A : Compare the evidence for complex settlement
from two areas that you have studied

differences

2 Main body of the text
■ Generalised answers are not appropriate and will not score high marks in essay questions . 
You must root your response firmly in archaeological contexts , selecting specific data and
explaining how it is relevant to the original question . 
■ Link your answer to relevant theory . 
■ Do not be afraid to use anthropological or geographical terms and concepts where
appropriate , for example Christaller , kinship , reciprocity . 
■ Explain conflicting or opposing theories which account for the same phenomenon where
appropriate . 
■ Select the relevant parts of some of the bank of case studies you have at your disposal . 
■ It is usually better to use fewer case studies in depth than to attempt a broader approach , 
which runs the risk of being superficial . 
■ Length is important – it is difficult for your ideas to develop sufficiently or for the
examiner to be able to reward you fully if your essays are very brief . You should aim for at
least three sides of A4 for a 25-mark question in a formal essay . 
3 Conclusion
■ Don ’ t just repeat what you have already said . 
■ Sum up your main arguments . 
■ Express a view where appropriate . 
■ Answer each part of the question . It is acceptable to give different responses to different
aspects of a question . Most conclusions will be a variation of ‘ to some extent ’  . 
List-type essays
There are many ways of producing plans . The models you select will suit your style and the
amount of time you have available . These three examples are all in response to the same listtype essay :  ‘ How does material culture change over time ?  ’ 
Example 1 : a detailed plan

■ Franchthi Cave ( long time depth and transition from hunting to farming ) 
■ Stone tool development from Oldowan to Neolithic ( links to evolution , innovation and
environment )  . 
■ Upper Palaeolithic spearpoints ( focus on one period , links to economics and functional
efficiency )  .

Discursive essays
Different types of essay can be planned using similar methods although their structure may be
different . Here is a plan for a discursive essay . Rather than expecting a list , the examiner is
allowing you to range widely for content but to structure it tightly in response to the following
question :  ‘ The majority of material from the past is archaeologically invisible ’ Discuss . 
Evaluative essay
All essays require some evaluation . Some , however , particularly focus on the evaluation through
comparison of strengths and weaknesses of a number of competing ideas . The trick is to
identify good material that allows you to demonstrate your grasp of the ideas and use it to
support judgements about which arguments you find most persuasive . For example consider the
question ‘ How far have archaeologists been able to establish whether environmental or human
factors best explain major change in the period you have studied ?  ’ 
This has some similarities to the task on farming ( see p . 209 )

Improving your essays
Experiment with the detailed plan and the
structure outline above with your next
assignment . If style has also been an issue
for you , also check p . 227 . 
Although material culture and economics are
different themes , there is considerable overlap
in relevant case studies . Economics is
concerned with how people manage the
cultural and natural resources available to them . 
Material culture is concerned with the things 
( in their broadest sense ) that people made and
what they signified . 
Material learnt for one theme can usually be
applied to the other . There are also strong links
with the post excavation analysis covered in
Chapter 3 . You need to link your grasp of
methods to your case studies in order to be
able to appraise their strengths and weaknesses . 
Other major links include interpretation 
( Chapter 5 )  , particularly the use of
ethnographic and experimental analogies , and
the use of geographic models to interpret
distribution patterns and site function ( p . 178 )  . 
SUBSISTENCE : HOW DID PEOPLE IN
THE PAST FEED THEMSELVES ? 
This is a fundamental question in most periods . 
Many writers have assumed that the type of
economic system used largely determines the
nature of society . Indeed , archaeologists define
many societies according to how they acquired
their food . If your course is thematic , you need
to ensure that you have case studies from a
range of societies .  ‘ Hunter-gatherer ’ is a label

used to cover a wide range of societies across
over 90 per cent of human history . For the
earliest period humans were not hunters at all . 
Hunting developed following a lengthy period
of scavenging and gathering . Archaeologists are
divided about when hominids began proper
hunting . Estimates have ranged from over 1
million years ago to about 100 , 000 years ago 
( p . 000 )  . The Mesolithic saw diversification into
a broad range of animals , fish and marine foods . 
In most parts of the world this was followed by
agriculture which provided the economic basis
for life up to the Industrial Revolution . Societies
that herd animals are called pastoralists . 
Rearing animals for food is also known as
animal husbandry . Sedentary farmers are 
usually associated with societies from the last
10 , 000 years . In some regions they were preceded by mobile horticulturists whose pattern 
of farming was very different to those of arable 
( crop ) agriculturists of historic times . 
Direct human exploitation of animals takes
many forms . Hunting may be random ( you kill
the first animal you encounter ) or selective

Intensive hunting may also include human
manipulation of the vegetation environment to
make conditions more favourable for a
particular species . Pastoralists may herd the
animals and exercise some control over
reproduction by selective culling of the stock . 
Finally , they may control all aspects of an
animal ’ s life , dictating where it feeds ( by the
creation of fields )  , dictating its mate ( by
creating single sex herds ) and so on . Wherever
an economy lies between hunting and stock
rearing it will leave slightly different signatures
in the archaeological record . Interpretation of
this will depend on an understanding of local
taphonomic processes . 
The direct contribution of animals to human
economy takes four main forms : 
■ as a source of food products such as meat , 
blubber , fat or marrow
■ as a source of secondary food products such
as blood , milk , cheese , butter
■ as a source of raw materials for artefact
manufacture , light and fuel including antler , 
bone , skins , grease , dung , hair and wool
■ as a source of traction , haulage and
transport . 
Primary products are all those which require
the killing and butchery of animals such as
meat or bone . Secondary products include all
those that involve utilising the products of
living animals such as dung and wool . 
Identifying the nature of exploitation
The interpretation of the contribution of
animals to the economy of a site is dependent
upon the recovery of a sufficiently representative sample of the animal population and the

KEY TERM
Material culture
At a general level , this term is applied to
the artefacts and structures produced by a
given people . They can be studied in a
biographical way , for example , what raw
materials were used , how they were
obtained and worked and how the finished
products were used . However , increasingly
material culture is used in a second way . 
This is based on the idea that the beliefs
and values of a culture are expressed to
some extent in the material things it
produces . People operate according to
particular beliefs , ideas and knowledge and
these in turn shape or structure everything
that people do . Studying material culture
involves ‘ reading ’ the symbolic meanings
embedded in artefacts and structures 
( see p . 183 )  . At university level you will
need to understand some of the debates on
this topic . Below undergraduate level you
just need a basic outline . In essence , 
archaeologists study the context material
things are found in and look for repeated
patterns between them . For example , 
similarities in design have led some
archaeologists to argue that Neolithic
tombs symbolised houses . They also explore
the way symbols in material things may
have , in turn , structured the way people
thought and interpreted their world . For
instance certain artefacts may be used to
express social identity . Pottery ( for
example beakers ) has been particularly
studied in this respect . 
identification of its age and sex structure ( see
p . 69 )  . Kill ratios are indicative of particular
strategies . Catastrophic profiles of the age and
sex of dead animals , where whole herds were
killed , suggests unselective hunting , for
example using stampedes . Over-representation
of particular animals provides evidence of more
selective hunting . The type of damage caused
to animal bones by hunting tools can help
corroborate this . Natural predators tend to
pick off the old , young and sick and early
human hunters were probably similar . This
does not endanger the survival of the herd and
creates an attritional bone profile . More
sophisticated hunters will manage herds , 
producing indistinguishable patterns of kills to

evidence
many farmers , for instance culling young males
but not the females needed to reproduce the
herds . Amongst pastoralist peoples , a predominance of older female bones may indicate
dairying . The presence of very young or
migratory animals provides clues to seasonal
patterns of exploitation . 
Bone assemblages also provide insights into
preferred food sources , although the archaeological record has a preservation bias towards
larger bones . Fish and bird bones in particular
are under-represented in the archaeological
record as are invertebrates . Inferences about
their importance can be made from the remains
of fish traps , specialist fowling tools or even
art , as in Egyptian tomb paintings . Isotope
analysis of human bones and teeth can indicate
the proportion of diet from animal , marine and
plant sources . Modern excavation techniques
have also added to our knowledge . Animal fats
have been recovered from Upper Palaeolithic
cave sites and phosphate analysis has been used
to identify stalls and paddocks . Tools , once
they have been interpreted , are used to make
inferences about hunting and processing
animals . Use wear marks ( see p . 65 ) and
traces of blood on tools can also be examined .

capability of tools and provide insights into the

also indicate how the animal was processed
through comparison with modern butchery
practice and experimental observation of
scavenged carcasses . Cut-marks near the joints
may indicate butchery for meat while smashing
the mid-section of long bones suggests marrow
extraction . Similarly , angled cut-marks on
animal skulls may indicate skinning . The
assemblages comprised of particular meat
bearing bones possibly indicate storage . Their
absence on sites suggests that consumption
occurred away from the butchery site . 
Tracing developments in human
exploitation of animals
Hunting or scavenging ? 
There has been continued debate amongst
archaeologists about when hunting began . 
Evidence from hominid bones suggests that
more protein was needed as brains enlarged . 
On the other hand , the long digestive tract in
humans is not suited to meat processing and
we are slow and lack cutting teeth . This does
not point to a long adaptation to hunting . 
Other clues to humans consuming meat include
bones and tools found next to each other on 
 ‘ living floors ’  . Even when the site is not a
palimpsest , association does not prove whether

from human butchery are distinctly ‘ V ’ shaped

from Olduvai Gorge suggested that hominids

A growing body of evidence supports
unselective hunting by the Middle Palaeolithic . 
A series of sites , such as Combe Grenal , that
feature the butchered remains of large numbers
of animals have been excavated . The
catastrophic bone profiles suggest stampeding
or similar forms of mass slaughter . The
discoveries at Boxgrove ( see p . 224 ) and
recent finds of spears in Germany appear to
provide evidence of hunting technology . 
Selective hunting
Modern human hunts are more persistent than
the charges of predators and involve human
culture . Hunters often work together , exchange
information and share food in base camps . 
Knowledge is needed , for example how to
create balanced , aerodynamic spears and where
to penetrate large animals to kill them . This
requires communication and the debate about
modern hunting is closely linked to debates
about when human social attributes developed . 
The evidence for selective hunting includes
specialisation . On some Upper Palaeolithic

KEY SITE
La Cotte de St Brelade
La Cotte is a Middle Palaeolithic site in
Jersey dating to around 150 , 000 years ago . It
has produced some Neanderthal teeth and
some stone tools , but its main interest lies in
possible evidence for hunting of large
mammals . The site is on a promontory close
to the sea but during its earlier occupation
the sea level was lower . Then it faced onto an
open plain leading down to the sea . The
archaeological material was found during the
excavation of a gully behind two isolated 
 ‘ stacks ’ of rock , at the foot of a sheer cliff . 
Apart from the human remains and tools
there was a considerable quantity of faunal
remains mostly consisting of mammoth and
woolly rhino bones of both adults and
juveniles . Some of these bones seem to have
been deliberately arranged against one wall of
the gully in at least two separate episodes . 
The excavator ’ s explanation was that the site
functioned as a ‘ drive site ’ for hunting , in that
the animals would have been carefully herded
into position on the slope leading to the cliff
and then stampeded to their deaths in the
gully below where they could be butchered at
leisure . There is a considerable body of
ethnographic evidence for similar practices
involving bison in North America such as at 
 ‘ Head smashed in ’  . This suggests a very
organised and concerted group effort perhaps
using firebrands to frighten the animals and
groups of people or stones as guide lanes to
steer them towards the cliff . The end result
would have been large quantities of meat to
be processed and the arrangements of large
parts of skeletons against the gully wall may
suggest storage practice in the form of a
cache .

sites in the Dordogne 99 per cent of the bones
are from reindeer . The kill profile is more
attritional while specialised artefacts indicate
sophisticated hunting technology . Spear
throwers , blades , bows and a variety of traps
for fish were all developed during this period 
( see also p . 225 )  . Humans used material culture
to transform their position in their
environment . Some aspects of this may be
reflected in their art ( see p . 232 )  . Sadly , no
mammoth traps of the type pictured in
children ’ s archaeology books have ever been
found . 
Broad spectrum foraging
Humans have been hunter-gatherers for most
of their existence although this was rarely
studied until quite recently and , even today , 
hardly at all below university level . In the
1960s attempts were made to explore hunting
through ethnography . A surprising finding was
that even in hostile environments , huntergatherers spent much less time working than
did farmers . Although some have questioned
the romantic view of hunter-gatherers as the
original affluent society ( they were time-rich
whereas we are rich in consumer goods )  , sites
with good organic preservation have revealed
that they often had rich diets and rich cultures . 
Where a diverse range of food resources were
exploited , many archaeologists now use the
term foragers to describe the economic
strategy . Foragers are not usually nomadic , 
tending to move around a defined area to
maximise resources . Mobility is a strategy to
minimise the risk of seasonal shortage rather
than being random . However , not all foragers
need this mobility .

KEY SITE
Stellmoor
This site on the North German Plain dates from the last ice age of 9000 BC and was occupied
briefly by groups of hunter-gatherers who specialised in hunting reindeer with bows and arrows . 
Their hunting method is known as an intercept strategy ( see also p . 174 )  . Reindeer travelled
along a regular path on their seasonal migration to the northern tundra to graze vegetation
during the brief ‘ arctic summer ’  . Excavation produced well-preserved organic material
including arrow shafts . An extensive range of stone tools was recovered including arrowheads . 
The arrows appeared designed to cause maximum damage and blood loss to enable a quick
kill . Analysis of damage , or lesions , caused by the arrows to the reindeer bones suggested a
pattern of arrow shots which concentrated on the vital organs , avoiding the ribs . Analysis of
the sex and age of kills provided evidence for selective culling of young males . This indicates a
very purposeful and organised approach to hunting in this period , and knowledge of the
animals ’ behaviour that is perhaps to be viewed as a stepping stone towards domestication . The
huge quantities of bone dumped in a nearby lake margin suggest the hunters were processing
more meat than they could consume . Ethnographic analogy suggests storage practices could
have included caching , drying or making pemmican . 
Herding and the domestication of animals
It used to be thought that domestication could
be identified from morphological ( shape ) 
changes in animals such as smaller horns . 
Domesticated animals were also smaller and
their bones less thick than their wild ancestors . 
However , climate can produce similar changes
and in any case the changes take place slowly . 
Where archaeologists have dated domestication
from changes in the size of animals or certain
features such as horns , they may have underestimated the date at which farming began . 
Herding was probably the end point of a long
period of parasitic herd management during
which humans acquired knowledge of animal
behaviour . 
For areas where domesticated species were not
native the dating of farming practices is easier . 
However , care has to be taken that a few exotic

KEY STUDIES
Baltic foragers of the late Mesolithic
Sites in Denmark and Scania ( southern
Sweden ) have produced remarkably wellpreserved evidence of foraging peoples . 
Continuity in flint technology and skeletal
shape suggests stable populations , while site
density and the absence of much disease from
human bones suggest that they were well
nourished . Their ‘ broad spectrum ’ foraging
economy drew on many different resources . 
Quantities of nuts and water chestnuts and
residues of porridge made from seeds testify
to the importance of plant food . However , 
isotopic evidence from human bone and a
range of specialised equipment suggests an
intensification in focus on marine foods . 
The submarine site at Tybrind Vig included
traps , nets and hooks along with a canoe with
an on-board hearth . This was possibly for
nocturnal eel fishing . Specialist prongs for eel
have been found elsewhere , as have fish-weirs
and harpoons . Remains of whales and sharks
in coastal middens may indicate offshore
fishing although they could represent
strandings . The faunal assemblages on some
sites suggest some specialisation , possibly on
a seasonal basis . They may have hunted seals
for their fat . Large numbers were killed and
sites often had exotic artefacts that may have
been traded for seal oil . Other sites such as
Ringkloster included the processed bones of
fur-bearing animals such as pine martens . 
Analysis of faunal assemblages indicates
selective hunting of deer , pig and aurochs , 
possibly even herd management of smaller
species . 
Quantities of data were sufficient for Mithen 
( 1990 ) to use computer analysis to compare
real assemblages with predicted assemblages
based on different models of hunting
behaviour . His research suggested that hunters
were being highly selective in animals they
stalked and killed and were under little
pressure to bring back meat from every trip . 
The key sites such as Ertebolle , Vedbaek and
Skateholm had hearths , pits , various
structures and their own distinctive pottery . 
Some even had cemeteries . They could afford
to become semi-sedentary and develop a rich
culture because their subsistence strategy was
so successful .

KEY SITE
Tell Abu Hureyra
A tell is an artificial mound up to 60 metres in height composed of mudbricks from
generations of houses combined with domestic rubbish . This tell in northern Syria was
excavated in advance of the building of the Tabqa Dam . Faunal remains were used to explore
hunting strategy and to trace the shift to pastoral agriculture in the region . Specialised hunting
had focused on ambushing the Persian gazelle that migrates in herds along predictable routes . 
They were herded into ‘ desert kites ’  , landscape features used as traps , and then dispatched with
spears . After several thousand years of this activity the numbers of gazelle being caught
decreased dramatically . Sheep and goats took their place . These two species are often lumped
together and referred to as ‘ ovicaprids ’ since it is difficult to distinguish between their bones at
this early stage of domestication . This change in the bone evidence coincides with a period
known by archaeologists in the region as PPNA ( see p . 207 )  . Later morphological changes in
ovicaprids such as shape of horn changing from curved to curly make the distinction much
easier . The gazelle of the region would never have been domesticated through specialist hunting
because they lacked traits of behaviour which made the ovicaprids more manageable .

food or sacrificial imports are not mistaken for
farming . The same applies to cereal grains . 
Post-domestication studies focus on what
purpose the animals were exploited for . The 
 ‘ secondary products revolution ’ is used to refer
to rearing animals primarily for purposes other
than food . This can be difficult to detect even
in the bone record . Fleece , for example , rarely
survives and leaves no physical trace on the
skeleton . Deformity from use in traction can
provide a useful indicator , but not always . 
Identifying human exploitation of plants
For foraging peoples , research has focused on
identifying which plants they used from plant
remains and specialised artefacts such as
digging sticks and grinding stones . Site catchment analysis has been used in conjunction
with environmental data to suggest possible
resources . Glimpses of the range of non-food
uses of plants have been obtained from sites
with exceptional preservation . Nets , boats 
and clothes ( Otzi the Ice Man ’ s grass cape ) 
have been recovered from later prehistory and
probably represent only a fraction of plant
uses . With the development of pottery , twisted
cord was used for decoration , suggesting that
the use of rope was well known . In the historic
period , the economic importance of agricultural
produce means that there is considerable
historical documentation of various sorts and
artistic sources that provide information on
techniques , organisation and productivity . 
Most attention has centred on the transition to
agriculture because of the impact it has had on
social development . Almost all civilisations
have been based on wheat , barley , millet , rice , 
maize or potato . 
Identifying the change to food production
Much early research on farming tried to
identify where the first domesticates appeared . 
The Near East is generally acknowledged to
have been the first , with wheat , barley , 
goats / sheep and cattle as its staples . However , 
it seems that a number of ‘ hearths ’ appeared in
different parts of the world based on a different
range of crops including maize in Mesoamerica
and rice in East Asia . Horticulture involves
modifying the growth cycles of plants , most
simply by weeding , to increase productivity
and usefulness . Arable agriculture is associated
with a specialised and systematic approach to
crop production , ultimately including fields . 
However , in its early stages agriculture
involved minimal changes in the toolkit of late
Mesolithic peoples , which makes its detection
difficult . Most of the evidence comes from seed

MATERIAL CULTURE AND ECONOMICS ■ 207
KEY TERM
Neolithic
The first descriptive blocks of time used by
archaeologists were based on changes in
material culture , for example Iron Age . 
Further refinements added sets of
economic and settlement criteria . The
Neolithic ‘ package ’ includes domesticated
crops and animals , sedentary ‘ village life ’  , 
agricultural tools such as grinding stones
and polished stone axes , and pottery . 
However , reality is rarely clear . At Near
East sites such as Jericho layers revealed
settled villages with domesticated animals
but no pottery – hence the term PrePottery Neolithic Age ( PPNA )  . The Danish
sites on p . 206 featured foragers with
some ‘ Neolithic ’ artefacts but not
domesticates . 
crops , which can give a somewhat distorted
view . Cereals are genetically malleable and
domestic varieties eventually became morphologically different from wild varieties . For
example , domestic maize cannot disperse its
seeds . The way they were processed meant
there was more chance of grains being
preserved through carbonisation than other
plant foods . Furthermore , other crops such as
legumes ( peas and beans ) seem to have changed
more slowly while root crops are almost
archaeologically invisible . The spread of arable
farming is easiest to track in regions where the
species were not native as long as original
distributions are known . 
In Britain and Ireland there was a lag of
hundreds of years between the appearance of
the first sign of arable crops and evidence of
widespread farming . Most of the early finds 
of cereals and cattle come from ceremonial
sites , suggesting that economics may not have
been the main reason for importing them . 
Relatively few settlement sites have been
excavated for this period which has led many
writers to suggest that the population was
mobile rather than sedentary and that wild
resources were still important . 
Once arable agriculture was established , its
traces are relatively easy to detect archaeologically , particularly through changes in pollen
sequences . Field and irrigation systems , storage
pits and specialist equipment from ploughs to
sickles become common from the late Bronze
Age . Interest then shifts to the productivity
and use of agricultural products . For classical
civilisations , art and written sources have
provided data on consumption and types of
crops . For other areas , experimental
archaeology has been valuable . Butser Ancient
Farm has demonstrated the kinds of yield
possible with ancient crops and explored their
response to a range of growing conditions . 
Detailed analysis of plant assemblages to
examine weed types and ratios of weeds to
grain and grain to chaff enable archaeologists 
to identify whether crops were grown and
processed on-site and suggest where the fields
were . 
Identifying the causes of domestication
For 70 years , since Childe labelled it the
Neolithic revolution in the 1930s , archaeologists have competed to explain the
development of agriculture . Most of the
theories seem plausible but all have limitations
and exceptions to the rule . 
Most works on the origins of agriculture make
the assumption that a sedentary , farming life
was superior to foraging . Certainly the wave of
pioneer farming which spread ( diffused ) 
through south-eastern and central Europe at a
steady rate seems to support this view . 
However , recent work on successful foragers 
( see p . 205 ) provides an opposing view . For
up to a thousand years the Mesolithic peoples
of north-west Europe did not adopt farming in
what is termed the ‘ Neolithic standstill ’  . There
were farmers to the south with whom they
occasionally traded so the ideas and crops were
available , but they chose not to adopt them . 
Why should people give up economic strategies
that produced a wide variety of foodstuffs and
other resources and may have provided
surpluses ? Farming is hard work and would
have produced a monotonous diet . 
Harris 1996
Eventually agriculture did spread and this
raises another question , why then ? Theories
include environmental change , the prestige
attached to cattle and grain and the possibility

KEY TASK
Contextualising the domestication debate
1 Take each of the seven explanations below . 
2 List them in the first column of a three-column table . 
3 For your area of study insert evidence that supports each theory next to it in the second
column and evidence that contradicts it in the third . 
4 Use this to rank the explanations for your area . 
5 Your analysis and evaluation would provide a skeleton for an essay ( see p . 191 ) on this
topic . A problem with each argument appears in italics . 
Agriculture developed : 
a ) when climatic changes led to humans and future domesticates being concentrated in
particular areas . Climatic data does not support this idea
b ) as increasing knowledge of plants and animals led via a series of stages to domestication . 
This doesn ’ t explain why it happened in some areas and not in others
c ) in areas that were rich in the right resources where people had time to innovate . This
doesn ’ t explain why it didn ’ t happen in all the ‘ right ’ areas or , if wild resources were so
good , why people should bother with farming
d ) in areas where there was population pressure and less wild food . Farming develops to
minimise risk . Population levels do not appear to have been high enough to force this
e ) in areas where foragers had been successful and become less mobile . Agriculture and
storage are developed to reduce risk in lean periods . Again , this does not happen in all
successful areas
f ) when successful broad-spectrum foragers in good areas spread into more marginal regions . 
Food production began in these regions to supplement foraging . As population levels were
raised farming spread . Eventually the environment was changed so that there could be no
return to foraging . This positive feedback model works best with maize and beans in
Mesoamerica but is more difficult to fit with evidence elsewhere
g ) when hierarchies developed in successful foraging societies . They turned to agriculture to
produce surpluses for trading and prestige reasons . This may work best with the adoption
of agriculture rather than its initial development

STORAGE
Figure 10 . 9 The archaeology of storage
of conversion . What is clear is that the
transition to farming was not a simple process
and that a variety of economic strategies were
selected by people according to social
requirements as well as ecological pressures . 
Increasingly , archaeological studies have
examined the social significance of different
models of food acquisition including gender
relations and social structure . 
STORAGE
Archaeologists study both the methods of
storage and the social and economic reasons for
it . Storage can be part of a wider economic
strategy . It may be used to overcome fluctuations in supply or to collect a surplus to use in
exchange . Storage can be linked to social power 
( see p . 244 ) and could be used by an elite to
control the distribution of resources to gain
prestige or power . The concept of storage can
be used to include energy , information , and
even the dead . 
Direct evidence of storage comes from the
containers or other features used to hold
produce . The central granaries of ancient civilisations such as the Roman military granaries at
Housesteads or the circular , ventilated warehouses for freeze-dried potatoes at Huanuco
Pampa may still be intact , as are many more
recent tithe barns . Sometimes they contain
traces of their former contents or illustrations
on their walls . Dumps of raw inorganic
materials such as coal or stone will also leave 
at least small traces of minerals in the topsoil . 
Similarly , features such as pits or silos of arable
farming communities are frequently recognised
and contain pollen or carbonised grain to
indicate their uses . On a smaller scale , storage
vessels including pottery and glass can be
examined in the same way for external decoration or residues of former contents . There may
also be written or artistic sources that illustrate
storage , including tax records and tomb
paintings . 
Other traces of storage need greater interpretation . Drying racks and off-ground structures
will only be represented in the archaeological
record by postholes . Analogies and experiments
were needed to interpret as raised granaries the 
 ‘ four posters ’ common on Iron Age sites such
as Crickley Hill . 
Landscape features may be ambivalent or even
represent different types of storage . Millponds , 
for example , may be stores of power , fish and
water . Dense clusters of posts or ditches may
represent corrals or stockyards for storing food
on the hoof . Phosphate analysis is useful in
confirming their function ( see p . 15 )  . If one
approaches storage in terms of energy , one
could also see herds of animals as a form of
storage in themselves . It is important to
remember this because there is a tendency to
associate storage with sedentary societies , yet

Knossos
The civilisation of early Bronze Age Crete was
based on several large ‘ palaces ’  . Each seemed
to have functioned as a collecting centre , 
which redistributed the goods and food
supplies produced in its hinterland . The
palaces themselves are complex groups of
buildings . They often include a central
courtyard , areas that have been identified as 
 ‘ royal suites ’ and a large number of long , 
narrow rooms often referred to as 
 ‘ magazines ’  . These served as storerooms . 
Some of them have stone-lined containers set
into the floor and huge ceramic jars up to 2
metres tall , called ‘ pithoi ’  , ranged along them , 
which would have held surplus amounts of
food and other imported commodities . 
Clay tablets with writing in Linear B , 
generally recognised as the earliest form of
Greek , contain lists of commodities flowing
into and out of the palace . The amount of
storage capacity at Knossos reflects both its
function as a redistribution centre at the
heart of a large and fertile area and its
status as a wealthy and prestigious palace . 
At Knossos power was exercised , craftsmen
worked and exotic goods were traded from all
round the eastern Mediterranean .

KEY SITE
Danebury
The Iron Age hilltop fort of Danebury shares many characteristics with Knossos , not least its
huge storage capacity . This took the form of bell-shaped pits a metre wide and up to 2 metres
deep , cut into the solid chalk . They had capacity of over 2 tonnes each and carbonised grains
have revealed that they were used to hold einkorn and emmer wheat , staple crops of the Iron
Age in Britain . Excavation and magnetometer survey revealed a large number of pits at
Danebury . A magnetometer survey of the nearby hill fort of Woolbury contained very few . 
Cunliffe ( 1995 )  , the excavator , used this evidence to support his idea that Danebury was a high
status site with a redistributive function . 
Reynolds ( 1979 ) tested the effectiveness of pit storage of grain through experimental
archaeology . Excavation had suggested that the pits had been sealed and covered with a
basketwork lid so that their contents would last over the winter . How they did this without
rotting was unclear . Reynolds argued that the carbonised remains of seeds found in the bottom
of some of the pits help explain how they worked . A small sample of chalk from the base of a
pit together with carbonised seed remains was analysed in a laboratory . Dr Simon Hillson
conducted a micro-excavation on the sample , removing and counting the seeds layer by layer
until he reached the chalk at the bottom of the pit . Hillson demonstrated that there were more
germinated seeds at the bottom , close to the pit wall . Using this information Reynolds dug a
pit and filled it with grain . Instruments were inserted to measure humidity , temperature and
gas exchange . The pit was sealed with chalk rubble and an airtight layer of clay . The results
were impressive . 
The grain in the pit gradually used up the available oxygen and produced carbon dioxide
creating an anaerobic environment The grain around the edges , especially when it was in
contact with the chalk , began to germinate and produced shoots until the point where oxygen
was used up and germination ceased . Provided the seal remained intact the grain lay dormant
and survived the winter in good condition . When the pit was opened the majority of the grain
could be used except for grain around the edges , which was full of mould and fungi . This
unusable grain had to be disposed of . Reynolds suggested that it was burnt ‘ in situ ’ in the pit , 
thus cleaning the pit to be ready for its next use . This would account for the carbonised grain
at the bottom . It also suggested that the grain was taken out in one go , perhaps for sowing or
trading , rather than used as a larder for food . 
This is an elegant example of the way that excavated evidence , experiment , analysis of plants
and geophysics can be woven together to produce a consistent set of ideas to be tested . 
Together they tell us a great deal more about life in the Iron Age than one piece of evidence in
isolation . 
Cunliffe 1995
ethnography has shown many examples of
storage practised by mobile pastoralists . 
Other forms of storage leave only indirect
evidence . Salting is often traced through
distinctive containers , known as briquetage , 
used to transport it . On some sites inferences
can be drawn from the nature of the food
remains . The restricted range of bone types at
La Cotte de St Brelade suggested the ‘ caching ’ 
of meat . At Stellmoor the sheer quantity of
meat was indicative of pemmican making . 
Insects associated with particular foodstuffs
also provide clues , for example grain beetles
from Roman York . 
Symbolic forms of storage are visible in the
archaeological record from later prehistory . 
Instead of raw materials themselves being
stored , they are exchanged for something
which is widely accepted as symbolising a value
in those materials . Coins are a particularly
sophisticated method of symbolically storing
value . They can be converted into goods at a
later date . They have the advantage of being
easily transported and concealed . Jewellery and
cowrie shells have been used in a similar way . 
The concept of social storage should also be
considered under this heading although it is
much more difficult to recognise archaeologically . This is where one person stores value in
others . In simple terms , if I give you a gift of a
cow , at some point in the future you will give
me something of at least equal value . In
practice , social storage is often highly complex
and can encompass marriages , feasting and
military alliances . Social storage blurs
economics with social and political affairs . 
However , for most of human history these
areas have probably been inextricably linked . 
Finally there are forms of storage which leave
little or no trace . Woodpiles constitute one of
the commonest types of stores but are usually
archaeologically invisible . Organic containers
such as baskets and skins only survive in
exceptional circumstances . The same is true 
of some agricultural produce , particularly
tubers . 
INTENSIFICATION
In a general sense intensification can describe
any strategy which re-organises economic
activity to increase production . It could be
applied to the development of traps and weirs
for fishing or the use of two-piece moulds to
speed up the manufacture of bronze axes . The
greatest physical impact of intensification can
be seen in evidence for increasing control over
the productive capacity of the land . It is often
associated with population pressure or social
control . 
The first traces of intensification of the
landscape can be detected from the soil and
pollen evidence for forest clearance and pioneer
farming . The intensity of production including
the exploitation of stock animals resulted in the
construction of elaborate field systems and land
divisions such as the Dartmoor ‘ reaves ’  . 
Environmental evidence can often establish the
ebb and flow of human impact . For example , 
around Avebury cycles of forest clearance and
later regeneration in association with fluctuations in the intensity of agricultural
exploitation have been traced . Medieval
attempts to intensify production by extending
the area of arable land can be identifed through
place names and earthworks such as strip
lynchets where hillsides were ploughed . 
Manuring to increase yields is generally
recognised from the halo of pottery scattered in
the fields around settlements ( see p . 14 )  . 
The countryside has also been the scene of
other forms of intensification , particularly
214 ■ ARCHAEOLOGY COURSEBOOK
extraction . Traces of quarrying , smelting and
mining can often be seen , particularly in upland
areas . 

Some of the most dramatic evidence of intensification comes from areas of the world where
artificial ways of supplying rainfall to crops was
needed to raise yields . Tomb paintings supplement the archaeological evidence for irrigation
schemes in Ancient Egypt . Here , canals had
been used to extend the area watered by the
annual floods of the Nile and so intensify
production . Records survive of the technology
developed to lift water from canals to fields
including the shaduf and later the Archimedes ’ 
screw , an early bronze version of which may
have been used to water the famous ‘ Hanging
Gardens of Babylon ’  . In the Oaxaca valley of
Mexico , field survey at Arroyo Lencho Diego
located 20 metres of sediment which had
accumulated behind a vanished dam . The
inhabitants had used the dam to irrigate the
whole of the valley in an area of otherwise
unpredictable water availability . The canals and
terraces that watered the fields supplying the
major town of Monte Alban still survive as
landscape features . Sometimes irrigation
schemes are not immediately visible . In the third
millennium BC a network of canals supplied
water from the rivers Tigris and Euphrates to
the fields and the port of the Mesopotamian
desert city of Mashkan Shapir . Today they are
buried under sand but were detected by satellite
imaging ( see p . 23 )  . In other instances there
was too much water for successful cultivation . 
At Kuk Swamp in New Guinea a huge network
of drainage ditches was first revealed by aerial
photography , showing as lines several kilometres long in modern tea plantations . Excavation
revealed that early farmers had built them to

Pulltrouser Swamp
The Aztecs developed a system of intensive
agriculture based on floating gardens or 
 ‘ chinampas ’  . Floating rafts were covered in
weeds and lake mud and anchored to the
lake bed in rows , with canals left between
for access . In time as more and more mud
was dredged onto them and the root
systems of trees bound the mass together , 
the rafts became fertile islands . They
produced two to three crops a year
especially of flowers and vegetables . The
system is still used in some parts of
Mexico . The remains of Aztec chinampas
have been revealed at Pulltrouser Swamp . 
Elsewhere , Aztec control over water is
revealed in the elaborate canals and
aqueducts around the capital Tenochtitlan , 
which supplied fresh water and separated
saline water . The tax demands of the Aztec
capital led to intensification of production
elsewhere in the region . At Cuexcomate , 
surveying has revealed terracing used to
maximise production of cotton . The
importance of water to the Aztecs is
underlined by the nature of their central
religious buildings and the imagery
associated with the god Tlaloc , which
occurs all over the main plaza at the heart
of Tenochtitlan . 
drain the swamp in order to intensively cultivate
the fertile soil and grow taro and other crops .  
( Bayliss-Smith 1996 ) 
Communications
One aspect of economies , which generally
develops in conjunction with intensification , is
transport . The remains of permanent tracks and
roads such as the Sweet Track or Roman and
Inca road systems can indicate increasing traffic
on routes . Intense use of these features can
sometimes be inferred from wear such as
rutting and evidence of frequent repairing . 
The development of vehicles can be traced
from burials , such as the four-wheeled carts in
burials at Ur or the ‘ chariots ’ from Garton
Slack , and through art and figurines . Evidence
for the use of animals for riding and draught
purposes can sometimes be determined by bitwear marks on teeth or artefacts associated
with harnesses . Artistic sources and shipwreck
evidence ( see p . 221 ) provide evidence of the
evolution of shipping . 
TRADE AND EXCHANGE
Early archaeological studies tended to largely
interpret the movement of artefacts and
materials as trade or the movement of peoples . 
Ethnographic examples have provided a much
wider range of options with which to interpret
archaeological evidence . There has also been
recognition that exchange does not just involve
goods and that its aims are often social rather
than economic . Often the relationship is of
more value than what is exchanged , for
example Christmas cards . The exchange may

Figure 10 . 13 Artistic sources are valuable for
providing some idea of what ancient vessels
may have looked like . Not all the evidence
provided by this mosaic from Ostia would be
recoverable archaeologically
also involve social obligations which help bind
society together . 
Exchange in its widest sense includes any
transaction between people . This can include
exchange of information , services and people . 
For instance , the spread of bell beakers
throughout Europe and North Africa in the
third millennium BC was due to exchange . 
Archaeologists have been divided over the
mechanism for this exchange , whether it was
through movement of people or the spread of
ideas , drinking culture or religion . Trade is just
one form of exchange . 
Three main categories of exchange have been
adopted by archaeology from ethnography . 
These are reciprocity , redistribution and
market exchange . 
Reciprocity
This involves transactions where a gift from
one person creates an obligation to return
something at a later date . We do this when we
buy a round of drinks . Many societies have
used it as the basis for social stability . In some
cultures marriage involves payment of
bridewealth from the husband ’ s family to the
bride ’ s family . This is to compensate for their
loss of a fertile worker . Payments may be in
goods and may take place over time . Such
exchange also cements the relationship between
the two families . Feasting and the sharing of
food with others are often a powerful example
of reciprocity . It creates an obligation to return
the favour at a later point . It can also be seen 
as an exchange of food for social prestige . 
A popular example for archaeologists has been
the Big Man feasts of highland New Guinea
where status is acquired by throwing huge
feasts at which party-goers are given generous
gifts of meat or livestock . A related concept is
social storage . Here a gift or favour is given
which stores up future gifts or assistance for
times when they will be needed . Extreme
examples of this are provided by ethnographic
accounts of the Potlatch and Kula Ring 
( Orme 1981 )  . Reciprocity can involve an equal
exchange ( balanced reciprocity ) but can also 
be positive or negative if one partner does
better . Ethnography once again warns against
imposing our values on the evidence . Islanders
on Yap in the Caroline Islands used to gain
prestige by spending their savings on huge
stone discs , which they then buried under their
homes . 
Historical sources such as Homer and Egyptian
tomb paintings have provided insights into
prestige goods exchange . High status
individuals establish and cement relationships
through reciprocal exchanges . This continues at
a more symbolic level amongst leaders of state
today . These exchanges used to involve
marriage partners and exotic goods or
creatures . Archaeologically this sort of
exchange may be recognised where special
artefacts such as gems , amber , jade and ivory
move long distances . In these cases archaeologists have talked of ‘ prestige goods chains ’  . 
A classic example is the movement of amber
from the Baltic to Mycenae during the Bronze
Age and some of the fine metalwork that
travelled in the opposite direction from central
Europe . Grave goods and special votive
deposits have often been the source of such
material for archaeologists . The rich graves 
at Varna contained bracelets of spondylus , a
Mediterranean shellfish . One interpretation is
that these were exchanged for gold from
sources close to Varna . However , some prestige
goods such as furs , slaves , silk and feathers may
be archaeologically invisible .

MATERIAL CULTURE AND ECONOMICS ■ 217
Redistribution
This model involves a central authority
collecting together resources and then
redistributing them . Our welfare state is a giant
version of this , while harvest festivals
symbolise it . In the past redistribution tended
to be operated by individual rulers to whom it
gave both prestige and legitimacy . 
Ethnographic studies have tended to emphasise
this as a role of chiefdoms , particularly in areas
of economic diversity . Redistribution shares
out particular resources to areas that lack them , 
for example fish to farmers and crops to
fishers . Historic accounts such as Celtic
histories suggest that rulers would use redistribution to reward their followers with weapons , 
cattle and exotic goods in order to secure their
loyalty . As with reciprocity , the social aspects
of the exchange may be important and , as
before , feasting may be the vehicle for the
exchange . 
Archaeological evidence includes sites with
central stores as at Knossos ( see p . 212 )  . 
Some interpretations of hill forts such as
Danebury ( see p . 180 ) have reached similar
conclusions although there is less agreement on
this . Patterns of distribution where valuable
goods have been widely distributed are also
potential evidence of redistribution to local
leaders from a central chief . The distribution of
Bronze Age swords may be such a case . The
clearest evidence comes from those sites where
records have been recovered as at Knossos and
Pylos . 
Market exchange
In its simplest sense ‘ a market ’ suggests a
recognised place where bargaining takes place . 
The easiest to identify are those where defined
areas or buildings exist . The agora of Greek
towns is an example . Another signature is the
development of mechanisms to regulate
amounts or to make exchange flexible . The
discovery of weights and coinage are the most
obvious examples . Of course , not all market
exchange happens in a fixed place and not all
currencies are archaeologically visible . Blankets
and carpets have been used as standards against
which value can be measured . Identifying these
instances of trade in perishable goods is
difficult . The well-preserved Pazyryk ‘ Ice
Maiden ’ from the Altai Mountains provided

Figure 10 . 14 Some types of exchange
identified by archaeologists
such a clue . Pazyryk tribes were known to
have trade links with China . When silk in her
clothes was analysed it was expected to have
been made of yarn from cultivated Chinese
silkworms . To the experts ’ surprise it turned
out to be characteristic of wild Indian silk . This
indicated that the Pazyryk traded to the south
as well as in China . 
Concentrations of artefacts from many areas
would be expected at a port or market . The
Iron Age settlement at Hengistbury Head , 
with its modified harbour and apparently
defensive wall , may be such an example . Finds
included imported pottery , glass and figs , with
evidence of metals and perhaps hides and corn
being exported . However , in some cases the
pattern of finds could equally represent a
religious or high status site . The many interpretations of Neolithic causewayed enclosures
typify this sort of ambivalent evidence . 
Although markets today are almost entirely
about buying and selling , they too have had
social functions . Ethnographic studies have
noted their role in information exchange , 
tax collection and as places for social
gatherings . Historic and artistic sources are
again useful . Spanish accounts of the use of
quetzal feathers and cacao beans in Mexico are
supported by the images of merchants and their
backpacks from the rather earlier site of
Cacaxtla . 
Identifying the signatures of different
modes of exchange
The origins of materials used in exchange are
tracked using characterisation studies ( see 
p . 62 )  . For example , lava millstones found
across England in the Saxon period have been
traced to quarries in the Eiffel Mountains in
Germany . Roman documentary sources tell us
very little about trade , but amphorae are very
common finds on excavations and in
shipwrecks . The fabrics of the millions of
Roman amphorae that were traded all over the
Empire have responded particularly well to
petrology , with the result that we now know
where most types were manufactured . As a
result it is possible to study the sources and
distributions of important agricultural products
such as Italian wine , Spanish fish sauce or
North African olive oil . Seals or other marks
on the objects themselves may indicate their
place of manufacture . For example , many
Roman amphorae have potters ’ stamps and
some even have handwritten inscriptions , 
written in black ink , giving details of their
contents and origin . Artistic sources can
provide considerable detail . Some Egyptian
tombs from the second millennium have
pictures of Minoans bearing goods from Crete . 
Distribution patterns of artefacts from their
place of origin are plotted on maps to see
whether they match models for particular types
of exchange . For example , clusters of Lava
quernstones at centres of manufacture and
ports such as Dorestadt and Ipswich have
enabled the trade to be traced . 
Trend surface analysis turns plots of finds on a
map into contours to smooth out distortion
caused by chance finds . This has been used to
map the distribution of Neolithic stone axes
from their source . 
Fall-off analysis is used to examine the rate at
which finds diminish the further one gets from
the place of manufacture . A sharp fall suggests
very local exchange , a smooth decline suggests 
 ‘ down the line ’ trade while a pattern with
several blips in the curve indicates secondary
trading or exchange centres . This technique has
been used to identify the nature of trade in
copper , obsidian and pottery .

MATERIAL CULTURE AND ECONOMICS ■ 219
The context in which particular artefacts are
found provides some clues . Shipwrecks provide
insights into the nature and scale of exchange
and who was trading what . Hoards may also
provide such evidence although the motives for
deposition could be more varied . A deposit of
axe heads could be a votive offering , a store of
scrap for manufacturing or a cache of trade
goods . 
Problems with exchange
Despite all these tools the nature of the
movement of artefacts or exchange is not
always clear . Not all of the possible types of
transaction leave clear traces in the archaeological record and different processes can look
remarkably similar in their spatial distribution . 
Sometimes only one side of an exchange can be
found . The fourth-century site at Gudme in
Denmark has revealed many hoards of gold
which originated in the Roman Empire . 
Whether these represent tribute , booty , 
mercenary pay or religious offerings is unclear . 
There are also cases where there was no
exchange . In some cases people moved , taking
artefacts with them . More commonly , people
collected local materials themselves . This is
thought to be the case with the movement of
obsidian from Melos , which has been found in
nearby settlements . 
STUDYING MATERIALS
Many of the methods used in studying
materials have been discussed in Chapter 3 and
they should be referred to for further detail . 
This section provides some additional pointers
for various stages in the use of material . You
need to be familiar with a range of materials , 
particularly metals , ceramics and stone , and
how they were used for the periods you are
studying . This should include at least one
example of diachronic change and the
development of technology . For example , the
production of bronze axes from initial flat
types to later socketed axes or the gradual
improvement in the efficiency of stone tools
from Oldowan pebble tools through Acheulean
and Mousterian types to the ‘ creative
explosion ’ of the Upper Palaeolithic . 
Acquisition of materials
Extraction of clay , stone and metal ores up to
the point where the material is ready to be used
are most frequently studied . Aside from
sourcing materials the remains of extraction
sites such as mines and quarries provide
insights into technology and scale of
production . Waste material also provides a
signature for particular processes whether it is
chippings from roughly dressed stone or slag
from smelting iron . Waste can be subject to
microscopic and analytical procedures similar
to those for artefacts . The distance materials

Three Mediterranean shipwrecks
Three wrecks excavated in one
region of the Mediterranean over the
last forty years provide a glimpse
not only of trade patterns of the
ancient world but of how
shipbuilding techniques changed over
time in response to social and
environmental factors . 
Kyrenia , Cyprus c . 300 BC
This wreck was a small merchant
vessel with a cargo of amphorae
from the island of Rhodes , identifiable by their seal stamps , and
millstones . There were very few
personal possessions , only a few
bone eyelets from a sandal and
some fig seeds . Underneath the hull
a collection of concretions were
recovered . When opened and used to
produce resin casts they proved to
be iron javelins , some of them bent
from impact on the hull . Since
there are no natural hazards in the
area , this evidence led the
excavators to believe that pirates
may have sunk the Kyrenia . The
vessel had settled down onto the ocean bed , and gradually became covered in silt . As its mast
and rigging rotted away , the lower part of the hull was forced outwards by the weight of the
cargo and broke apart . 
Protected by the silt , which choked off oxygen and killed the marine worms that infested it , the
remains of the hull were preserved . The ship was built in the traditional way of the classical
Greeks , which is ‘ hull first ’  . Planks are carved by eye to fit along a keel , with timber selected
for its natural curvature as appropriate to different parts of the vessel . The sculpted planks
were held together along their edges by thousands of mortise and tenon joints which gave a
very strong hull braced only with frames at a later stage . This process wasted 70–80 per cent

of the wood used and required a high standard of craftsmanship from the shipwright . It would
only be possible in a society which valued craftsmanship , where raw materials were abundant
and where time was no problem . The man who built the Kyrenia was probably a slave and his
time was his master ’ s . 
Yassi Ada , Turkey c . AD 625
This wreck was dated by coins recovered from the wreck to the reign of the Byzantine
Emperor Heraclius . An elaborate ‘ steelyard ’ with the head of a boar at one end and a sliding
bust of Athena at the other declared itself to be the property of ‘ George senior , sea-captain ’  . 
Historical documents suggest he was one of a growing class of merchants who financed their
own ventures and often captained their own ship . The vessel itself was partly constructed in the
old classical ‘ hull-first ’ style , with logs sculpted to fit . However , this time the mortise and tenon
joints were less carefully executed . They were fewer in number and often nails were driven
through them once the plank was located . The upper section of the hull was built by the new 
 ‘ frame-first ’ method . Many flat planks were cut from a log and twisted against internal frames
as they moved forward along the hull . This more economical use of materials and time suggests
that social conditions had changed from the time that the Kyrenia was built . The Byzantine
shipwright was a free man contracted to do the job . His employer would have been concerned
to save time and timber and therefore money . Byzantine society still used slaves but only in the
household and not in an industrial context . 
Serce Limani , Turkey
This medieval Arab merchant vessel was found to contain a cargo of glass . Eighty intact pieces
from the ends of the ship possibly represented personal possessions or items of merchandise
but the centre of the ship held several tonnes of raw and broken glass . The raw glass or ‘ cullet ’ 
would have been added to new batches to improve quality and the broken glass seems to
represent the sweepings from a glass factory . Many of the pieces were twisted or malformed in
the process of blowing or moulding and had been discarded . The excavators classified the
millions of pieces of glass by sorting them according to attributes such as colour , pattern and
location on original vessels , for example rim sherds . By following this process meticulously a
large number of pieces were eventually re-assembled . The cargo demonstrates craft specialisation and the technology of production , but the fabric of the ship itself is equally rewarding . 
The Serce Limani ship was built entirely by the ‘ frame-first ’ technique . First the keel was laid
down . Frames were attached to it and planks bent around the frame to form the hull . The
technique is still used in shipyards around the Mediterranean and gives a strong hull while
being economical in use of wood . Many hull planks can be cut from a single log . This
development clearly happened between the building of the Yassi Ada and the Serce Limani

wrecks in the early medieval period when historical scholars tell us that there was considerable
conflict between the expanding Arab world and the Byzantine Empire . Historical records
describe massive losses of ships through warfare . It is easy to visualise a cycle of forest
clearance to feed an ever-increasing demand for ships creating a situation where there was
pressure to budget-build new ships . The Serce Limani vessel shows signs of compromise on
quality and it was also ‘ armed to the teeth ’  . In addition to the glass , large numbers of spears
and a cache of fine swords were discovered . These three wrecks demonstrate diachronic change
in technology over a thousand-year period and a range of economic specialisation ( see 
p . 227 )  .

Boxgrove
Boxgrove was occupied by hominids of the type Homo heidelbergensis around 500 , 000 years
ago . It was a beach backed by sea-cliffs . Microwear studies of tools and animals bones
produced interesting results . In one case fragments of flint were visible in a ‘ knife-cut ’ where
they had broken off a tool during butchery . In another case , the bone of a rhinoceros , it was
clear that human butchery marks lay under the tooth marks of a scavenging carnivore . In other
words , the human had got there first . Hunting evidence came in the form of a horse scapula
with a very neat circular perforation on the outside and a splintered ‘ exit wound ’  . This
suggested a high velocity projectile , perhaps a fire-hardened wooden spear such as the ones
discovered at Lehringen . The find of an ‘ antler hammer ’ potentially provides a new perspective
on human mental capacity and behaviour for this period . It suggests a degree of planning , 
forethought and ‘ curation ’ that was believed to be beyond the capacity of hominids at this stage
in evolution . The hammer also provided corroborative faunal dating evidence . The antler came
from a giant elk which became extinct around 500 , 000 years ago .

have travelled can be significant . Materials
which have travelled far from their source and
which are relatively rare in the context they are
found in are often referred to as exotics . This
term also often implies a high ‘ value ’ for the
material in the eyes of the people using it and
consequently its possession may suggest high
status . Such materials include gold in burials , 
for example Bush Barrow , Roman amphorae in
Late Iron Age burials . Exotic materials often
have their own inherent symbolism . 
Manufacture
Analysis of materials and finds of tools and
processing features such as kilns are vital in
understanding production . Our understanding
of Bronze Age metallurgy combines chemical
and physical analysis of ores , interpretation of
moulds and finished artefacts , and analogies
drawn from ethnography and experimental
archaeology . Similar approaches have been
applied to stone tool manufacture and ceramics
production . 
It is not only finished artefacts that provide
interesting sources of information about raw
materials . A wide range of techniques may be
applied to sites as different as the scatter of
stone fragments discarded by a prehistoric
hunter-gatherer making tools in a temporary
camp in East Africa ( for example refitting )  , or
the ruins of a nineteenth-century lead mining
complex in northern England . Many details 
of the very recent industrial past either went
unrecorded or the relevant documents have not
survived . Scientific excavation and the recovery
of carefully chosen samples for analysis will
help to clarify both types of site . Our understanding of these processes has to be balanced
by awareness of the differential survival of
materials . Our knowledge of ancient woodworking , for instance , largely comes from
exceptional wet sites ( see p . 51 )  .

KEY STUDY
Late Ice Age hunting technology
Knecht ’ s ( 1994 ) study of the evolution of
Upper Palaeolithic projectile points has
shown in detail how people adapted to the
ice age environment and to the animals
available for hunting . It has also
demonstrated advanced conceptual abilities
among these people and an acute
awareness of the physical properties of the
raw materials that were available . Knecht
was able to illustrate technological
progress towards more efficient , flexible
spears . Another major consideration in the
gradual changes in material and design
was the ease of repair whilst away from
camp . She also carried out experiments
using a goat carcass to test the velocity
and efficiency of the spearpoints as hunting
weapons . Her findings corroborate those
from Stellmoor . Flint points propelled by
bow , spearthrower or unaided human
muscles were formidable weapons , capable
of penetrating animal tissue and bone . The
hunting of large , dangerous prey could be
carried out effectively and more safely
from a distance .

The Sweet Track
The only areas of higher ground on the area of peat wetland known as the Somerset Levels are
slight sandy knolls . These have been used for settlement since the Neolithic . Prehistoric people
faced the problem of ensuring effective communication between settlements and they solved it
by constructing sophisticated trackways . They invested considerable communal effort into
ventures that in some cases lasted only a few years . The ‘ Sweet Track ’ has been dated to the
Neolithic period around 4000 BC , which makes it earlier than most of the megalithic
monuments . Its construction reveals considerable woodworking skill and woodland
management . The planks of the walkway were split from tree trunks using wedges , and other
components were made from coppiced wood from oak , hazel and alder . This implies sustainable
management strategies and forward planning . Items found alongside the track , such as jadeite

spiders and rodent-gnawed hazelnuts provided much detail about the surrounding wetland . 
Dendrochronological dating of the timbers suggest that the Sweet Track was built fairly quickly
and only lasted some eleven years before going out of use .

SPECIALISATION
Specialisation is often used as an indicator of
social complexity . It demonstrates a degree of
interdependence within a society and often
between that society and others . The more
complex a society becomes the more interdependent its members become . If the production
of artefacts is concentrated in the hands of a
few people it also implies skills are not
available to all members of society . It may
indicate age and gender differentiation . There
are two main types of specialisation : 
■ Attached specialists are craftsmen who live
in close proximity to a high status person . 
They may be part of their extended family
and related by birth or marriage . 
■ Independent specialists produce goods to
market for their own profit . They are not

Improve your style ! 
A comment frequently seen on student reports and returned work is ‘ your style could be
improved ’  . It is often difficult to work out what this means and harder still to do something in
response . Sometimes the comment actually refers to structure and sometimes to written
English . Generally speaking it is about how you knit the essay together . Here are three
mechanical things you can do to help yourself in your next piece of work : 
1 Use words and phrases which lead you to consider several pieces of evidence and
reach judgements
Include all of the following at least once : 
for example however therefore an alternative
potentially extent on the other hand nevertheless
2 Gobbets and gambits
One way of looking at your notes is that they represent lots of chunks of knowledge . These are
your gobbets . In writing a response to a question you need to join these together as seamlessly
as possible . The linking phrases which join up explanations or examples are gambits .  ( see 
p . 164 .  ) 
3 Vary your sentence length
At secondary school you may have been encouraged to use longer words and more complex
sentences . Sometimes this can lead to rather turgid writing . To make your work more ‘ punchy ’  , 
experiment with alternating sentence length . Short sentences can give your work more impact
and are often clearer . Never use a complex word if a simpler one does the job just as well . 
controlled by anyone else but may still be
interdependent . For example , the hundreds
of specialists working in the leather trade in
Fez , Morocco . Each worker specialises in
one of the many stages involved in turning
raw , uncured skin into finished products , 
selling them and transporting them . All of
these people are craftsmen in their own
right . All depend on others in the chain for
their business to survive . 
IDENTIFYING SPECIALISTS IN THE 
ARCHAEOLOGICAL RECORD
Very often archaeology concentrates on the
finished products as evidence of craftwork , for
example mosaics , figurines , swords or ships 
( see p . 221 )  . However , manufacturing debris
can also be important , as can the very names 
of locations where craft workers concentrated , 
which may have survived , albeit in altered
form , over time . Both of these sources are
illustrated in Viking York where there is much
waste material from leather working and trial

Burial evidence has often been interpreted as
evidence of specialisation , where particular
tools are found in graves . The Sutton Hoo
burial contains several examples of craftsmanship from all over the Anglo-Saxon world , 
in particular a tiny pyramidal jewel that had
been originally attached to a sword hilt . Each
face is a plate of gold with tiny ‘ cells ’ built up
on it with gold wire in the technique known as
cloisonné . Each cell is fitted with its own
individually cut prisms of garnet and some are
provided with chequered metal foil underneath
to enhance the glitter of the stones . The
precision and exquisite craftsmanship of the
worker at such a small scale is breathtaking . 
That so much time and effort was lavished on
what is really a tiny detail of the king ’ s burial
goods is also a testament to his status . 
ART
This term is applied to images and objects 
( often produced for non-utilitarian purposes ) 
which show appreciation of aesthetic qualities . 
It may include decoration on functional objects
or decoration that forms part of a system of
iconography . The meaning of art is culturally
embedded and may prove difficult to access . 
It is most relevant to the themes in Chapters 8
and 11 . Studies of art under material culture
should concentrate on the technology of their
execution rather than on interpretation . Thus if

Copan
A fortuitous earthquake buried a craft workshop in this Maya town very quickly . Tools of the
trade were left on the workman ’ s stone bench in a ceramic bucket . The craftsman had worked
precious stone such as jade into items of jewellery and inlays for teeth . There were no metals
in this society so his tools included antler drills , sand paste and bladelets of obsidian , probably
mounted into a wooden haft to act as a saw . Such painstaking and time-consuming work was
largely directed towards producing prestige items for a wealthy lord . This was an attached
specialist who was not working for himself and was not part of any market system . His time
was his lord ’ s , a man to whom he was almost certainly related and in whose patio he lived . 
Also in Copan , a burial demonstrates that craft specialisation was not restricted to the lower
ranking members of a complex society . The body lay in an elaborately decorated chamber at
the heart of the acropolis . The floor of the tomb was littered with decomposed pieces of bark
codices – the books of the Maya . Rich grave goods and the sacrificed body of a young slave
had also been provided . It was clearly a royal burial but whose was it ? The ages at death of
the kings of the appropriate era did not match the skeleton . Ceramics in the tomb provided
clues . Some of them were clearly associated with painting . Indeed one carried a human
portrait of a man wearing a special monkey headdress and with scribes ’ brushes in his mouth . 
He represented the patron god of scribes . The body was probably a son of King Smoke-Imix , a
royal scribe whose duty was to paint the books containing the history and mythology of his
dynasty , and who performed a vital role in sustaining his family ’ s power and status .

The Basse-Yutz flagons
A pair of bronze flagons , now in the British Museum but originally from Alsace , can be used to
make a number of points about the nature and role of craft specialists . They are from the Iron
Age and yet they are made of bronze in common with most decorative objects from that
period . They were decorated with inlaid enamel and coral that must have come from the Red
Sea . The artist linked Celtic mythology with classical ideas in the iconography of the pieces , 
combined with a sense of humour . Ducks appear to swim down the stream of liquid as it is
poured from the spout . These jugs were almost certainly used to serve wine , a novel drink in
central Europe at this period , which was imported from the classical world to the south . The
mixture of native and classical ideas in the art shows clearly that classical culture was having
a great impact on the Celtic world long before the Roman conquests . The Celtic craftsman
exploited exotic materials and iconography to enhance a vessel used to serve an exotic drink at
an institution which classical writers tell us was central to Celtic society – the feast . We have
to imagine the gleam of polished bronze , lifted high to pour the dark red wine in a glittering
stream into the goblets of rival chieftains . The ability to procure the fashionable wine and
outface others who still relied on the old beer or honey mead was a powerful way to mark
status . 
In Celtic society craftsmen were regarded as part of the elite . They were on a par with bards
and druids , in view of the ‘ magical ’ processes that they controlled , turning dull ores into
functional objects like chariot fittings or superb works of art like these flagons . They had a
much wider social role than the purely functional at a time when kings began to advertise
themselves through coinage and the iconography it carried .

the context of study is Palaeolithic cave art , the
focus should be on skills of draughtsmanship , 
paints used and the techniques of painting . 
Higher levels of study will require you to
grapple with definitions of art and material
culture . Pottery provides a good example of the
sort of issues you might want to consider . 
Ethnographic studies suggest that both the
production and the form of pottery are often
determined by cultural rather than purely
material considerations . A pot can be
functional in terms of its ability to hold its
contents and withstand heat but other aspects
are more to do with its social use than its
functionality , in particular decoration and
colour . Beliefs and values determine the ‘ right
way ’ for things to look even when that way is
not the most functional . In Middle Saxon
Southampton , imported pitchers became
popular . They were more functional for
pouring liquids than existing pots , yet local
potters did not copy them . Instead they
continued to turn out traditional vessels . 
Another instance where symbolism may have
outweighed practicality was the use of flint as
temper in some prehistoric pottery . There are
usually alternative tempers available and flint
would be painful to work in .

Palaeolithic cave art
A common misconception is that Upper Palaeolithic cave art in Europe consists of ‘ hunting
scenes ’ which we can interpret through our imagination . Nothing could be further from the
truth . In most cases we cannot be sure which images on a particular wall were painted at the
same time , never mind whether they ‘ go together ’ in any meaningful way . Images of animals
predominate but not usually in proportion to their importance as a food source . For example , 
reindeer were one of the most common prey species but they were not the most frequently
painted . Images of human beings tend to vary hugely between schematic at one end of the
scale , as at Cougnac and Lascaux , or intensely realistic , as at La Marche . In addition to the
main images there are also many ‘ signs ’  , which have been interpreted literally as spears , nets , 
traps and houses . A different approach , pioneered by Lewis-Williams and Dowson ( 1988 )  , sees
these ‘ signs ’ as ‘ entoptic ’ or geometric shapes that are ‘ hard-wired ’ into our central nervous
system as humans . We project them over the top of images from everyday life when in an
altered state of consciousness such as a trance . These geometric shapes are shared by all
modern peoples and therefore by the people of the Upper Palaeolithic . Similar analysis has
been carried out on the Neolithic rock art of Britain and Ireland . 
A second example of the range of interpretation concerns an image from a lesser-known area
of Lascaux cave . It consists of a bison on one side , which may or may not be related to the
rest of the image . The bison appears to have its entrails hanging out and to be pierced by
several feathery ‘ spears ’  . Both of these features could be interpreted in other ways . Opposite is
a figure of a man with a staff below him topped with the image of a bird . On closer inspection
the man is seen to have an erection . His hands and feet are rather like those of a bird with

four toes , his face is elongated , ending in a beak and on top of his head is a crest . A recent
interpretation of these images has suggested that the human figure is a shaman in a trance
state . Shamans in Bushman groups
often describe themselves as feeling
weightless and elongated . The shaman
is being transformed into his animal
spirit companion , in this case a grouse
as suggested by the crest on the
figure ’ s head . We are invited to imagine
the man dancing and imitating the
movements and sounds of the bird as
part of his performance , probably
dressed in a bird costume and carrying
magical artefacts such as the staff
below him . Ethnographic rituals such
as this were described among the
native Americans of the north-west
coast in the nineteenth century and
some of their elaborate masks and
ritual equipment can be seen in the
British Museum and Pitt-Rivers
Museum . On the other hand , the staff
may be a spearthrower . 
As a result of the many interpretations
of meaning , there are almost as many
interpretations of the function of these
images . Several writers have suggested
a religious aspect to the work , such as
totemism ( see p . 148 )  , or magic
related to hunting or fertility . Others
have suggested that their function may
have been educational , transmitting
knowledge about animals or belief and
culture , perhaps as part of rites of
passage . Many of the paintings are not in easily accessible areas . Of course they may have had
several functions , perhaps changing over time including art for art ’ s sake . 
We can be more certain about the techniques of cave art . Research has discovered the use of
ferrous and manganese oxide for paint , chewed twigs and fingers as brushes and stone lamps

Writing evaluative essays on concepts
These are often the types of essay which students find hardest . Questions on this theme often
take the form ‘ To what extent can archaeologists recognise X ?  ’ X could be status , gender , 
chiefdoms or war . Whichever it is , you need to deploy several relevant case studies to explore
the concept and its archaeological visibility . The nature of the topic means you need to be very
aware of bias in interpretation and of the strengths and weaknesses of models , particularly
ethnographic ones , which archaeologists have employed . You need to be comfortable with the
terminology and to construct a complex argument . 
The following exercise includes examples from different periods . To produce your own version , 
replace these with your own examples . 
Q : To what extent can archaeologists recognise territoriality ? 
1 Discuss what territory is . Is it the same as site catchment or the hunting ranges of
Mesolithic foragers ? 
2 Discuss modern notions of territory , which is static and rooted in ideas of the sovereignty of
nation states . This is marked with physical borders , coinage distribution , flags and other
symbols . 
3 Discuss some possible archaeological examples of territory : 
■ Bronze Age : land divisions on Dartmoor or Fengate – territories , ranches or a bit of
both ?

5 Conclusion : in which of your examples is there the strongest evidence and why ? For

it to do with survival of evidence ? Use these points to explicitly address the ‘ how far ’ 
element in the question . 
Hawkes ( p . 138 ) identified the archaeology of
past social systems like that of ritual as a
difficult topic for archaeologists . Despite this , 
most archaeologists have written with
confidence on the societies they have studied
and used a wide range of models ( particularly
from ethnography ) to help interpret their
sources . 
WHAT IS SOCIAL ARCHAEOLOGY ? 
Social archaeology can usefully be divided into
three main subsections . How societies organise
themselves ranges from the basic units of
family , kin and bands to the political organisation of states . Divisions within society
include different treatment based on age or
gender and also stratification according to
wealth , power or status . Finally there is social
action and change . This can include phenomena
like warfare or how and why societies changed
in the past . 
When studying this topic , an anthropological
or sociological textbook ( for example Giddens
1989 ) is a useful source of help with terms . 
Since this is the last thematic chapter of this
coursebook there is danger of repetition . 
Where possible , we have cross-referenced issues
here to studies in earlier chapters . We have also
tried to include critical points in each
subsection to help you write evaluative essays .

YOUR GOALS
You need to 
■ understand the main concepts used
■ use case studies to apply and test the key concepts
■ grasp the strengths and weaknesses of the techniques used by archaeologists to reconstruct
society from physical evidence
■ develop your ability to write evaluative essays . 
For non-literate societies , archaeologists have
relied heavily on evidence from burials to
understand social organisation . Burial evidence
has also supplemented historical records for the
classical period . In addition , information has
been drawn from settlement patterns , artefacts
and art . Since the strengths and weaknesses of
these sources are similar for each topic , we
have tackled them more fully for status and
gender and avoided repetition on the other
topics . Where you are writing evaluative pieces
you should ensure that you refer to status and
gender in your reading . 
FORMS OF SOCIAL AND POLITICAL
ORGANISATION
Archaeology developed in the earlier part of
the twentieth century when evolutionary ideas
were being applied in the social sciences and
when much of the world was directly ruled by
colonial powers . It is understandable then that
evolutionary models of social development
were applied to the past . As societies became
increasingly ‘ advanced ’ and ‘ civilised ’ they were
expected to develop along similar paths . Much
archaeological research sought to trace this
development and identify reasons for particular
regions being more advanced than others . 
Although western ideas of superiority have
been challenged in recent decades , what are
now termed neo-evolutionary models of social
development are still commonplace . 
All of the terms used to classify social organisation conceal considerable variation . However , 
we do need to use such concepts as the starting
point for comparing and contrasting social
groups and talking about them . 
Bands are self-sufficient groups of a few
families . Leaders are likely to have emerged
because of experience or personal qualities and
to have been temporary . Bands may have been
fluid , with families or individuals moving to
join other groups . They may also have only
lived together during particular seasons . The
term is most frequently used in archaeology for
the Upper Palaeolithic and Mesolithic . To some
writers bands looked like an egalitarian society
although ethnographic research has shown that
inequalities exist in many modern bands .

Figure 11 . 1 Terms used in social archaeology
Tribes are larger than bands with kinship
linking the group together . Leadership may be
fluid . Tribes often have activity leaders who are
recognised as having skill and authority in
particular areas such as hunting or ritual . 
Potentially most adults may be leaders in some
areas and therefore none may stand out overall . 
Of the models of political organisation and
leadership that have been borrowed from
anthropology for tribes , the most influential
has been the Bigmen of New Guinea . These
are individuals who rise to prominence through
their skill in key areas of economic and social
life such as herding or hunting . Their position
as Bigmen allows them to conduct trade and
alliances on behalf of their group of several
hundred people . Their position is cemented by
their ability to provide generously for their
followers . They accumulate wealth , usually pigs
or another food source , and redistribute it at
major feasts . The position is not hereditary and
others who are better placed to dispense
generously often replace Bigmen . 
Both bands and tribes are sometimes referred
to as segmentary societies . This is where
society is made up of lots of similarly sized
groups with little difference in wealth , status or
power between them . This contrasts with the
more ranked and unequal chiefdoms and states . 
Chiefdoms are more formally organised and
ranked than tribes . Within ethnographic
literature there is a huge range of different
forms of chiefdom with numbers of followers
ranging from around 1 , 000 to 10 , 000 , so we
must assume the same is true of the past . 
Chiefdoms are usually hereditary , although the
role may alternate between a group of families
rather than remain in just one . As a result in
most cases chiefs are viewed as different from
the rest of the social group . They usually have
an important ritual role as well as redistribution , law giving and leadership roles . Their
permanent position and high status may result
in other differences including more marriage
partners and more or different possessions . 
Social ranking in chiefdoms can be very
elaborate . 
In some instances kings differ from chiefs in
terms of scale . Kings will usually preside over
several social groups , each with their own subking or chief . The term was used for
nineteenth-century Africa as well as for the
classical and medieval worlds so variation is
considerable . The position is hereditary with
some , although not all , being seen as divine .

They are likely to have a larger than usual
household and may have permanent social and
economic organisations based close to them , 
for example a permanent guard . Their need to
display their position through exotic goods and
provide gifts to supporters may mean that their
household includes attached specialists . 
States are political systems where permanent
institutions develop independent of individual
leaders . There are likely to be formal laws , 
weights and measures and specialists associated
with justice , warfare and taxation . Many
kingships will also be states , although not all . 
All modern societies are nation states . 
Key features are likely to include permanent
borders , uniform currencies and centralised
authority . Developed states tend to be very
complex with a tendency to increasing
specialisation . 
There are also many ways of organising society
which don ’ t fit neatly into a hierarchy . The
most basic unit is the family or household , 
which exists in all societies . Kinship is another . 
The significance of blood or marriage ties
varies considerably . In the past they may have
been the most important form of social organisation , for example the Scottish clan system . 
Although their relevance in modern western
society has declined there are still exceptions , 
notably the Mafia . Other divisions , which may
cut across simple group definitions , are age or
moiety-based groups . Their existence means
that individuals may have several different
affiliations . It is worth noting that bands , tribes
and chiefdoms still exist in different parts of
the world . 
Identifying social and political
organisation in the archaeological record
It is likely that the forms of organisation that
have ranking and permanent institutions will be
most strongly represented in the archaeological
record . Chiefdoms and kingships where status
is ascribed ( see p . 241 ) may have permanent
high status buildings as well as symbolic
artefacts . Bigmen are less likely to be visible in

The translation of such scripts was a triumph
of early archaeology . However , this has tended
to reinforce the idea that we can only
understand those societies from the past which
have a written culture . Writing systems have
also been used as a marker of advanced
civilisations . This too has been used in a
negative sense since by extension societies
without writing have been seen as ‘ uncivilised ’  . 
Archaeology has done much to correct this view

with adult males in their prime . By old age
they may have redistributed their wealth so it
may not even appear in their graves . The
affiliations of individuals may not all be

While pottery that carries emblems of
particular groups may survive , clothing , tattoos
or tribal scars will not . In life the latter group
may have been more important . 
Settlement size provides a clue to social organisation . In general , societies composed of lots of
small settlements are associated with bands and
tribes . The development of henges and hill

Ages has been used by some archaeologists to
trace the emergence of chiefdoms and

tended to be evidence in the grave goods . 
In addition , while rank may be concentrated in particular age and sex groups in
the population it is more archaeologically
visible than horizontal divisions which are
more equally distributed . Horizontal social
divisions based on clan , moiety and age
tended to be archaeologically invisible . 
From the historic accounts it was clear
that some of these identities had been
celebrated during the funerary rituals while
a person ’ s ranking had not been
emphasised . This may indicate that the
horizontal divisions were more significant
in life . It also tells us that we cannot hope
to read all status from burials . 
KEY STUDIES
Later Bronze Age Britain and Ireland
A succession of writers have examined
landscapes and the settlement patterns
within them for evidence of increasingly
hierarchical societies . The extension of food
production has been linked with evidence
of exchange in exotic goods over very long
distances . The implication is that powerful
individuals were amassing surpluses to
trade on behalf of their communities . 
Contemporary evidence from Greece , which
was at one end of the European ‘ prestige
goods chain ’  , provides a model for this . 
The heroes of Homer ’ s epics often derived
their wealth from agriculture and spent it
on war and on gifts for their kin , followers
and allies , including fine weapons and
feasts . Many studies have pointed to
increasing control over the land during the
Bronze Age through the building of
boundaries , for example Fleming 1988 . 
There is also evidence for increased craft
specialisation and intensification of
production , particularly of weapons as at
Runnymede . Grogan ’ s ( 1999 ) regional
study of Irish hilltop enclosures showed
that these very visible , but not always
defensive , settlements were established at
regular intervals across the landscape . 
Artefacts suggest that these might have
been the bases of local chiefs . 
of crafts or bureaucracy has also been used in
this respect . Models from Egyptian tombs
show many specialists at work and there is a
fine collection of them in the British Museum . 
POWER AND SOCIAL CONTROL
Power , the ability to make others do what you
want , can be approached via status or via
evidence of social control . This can be inferred , 
but not proved , from the apparent organisation
of labour for large communal monuments such
as the henges of Neolithic Wessex . In some
cases such as Egypt or the Maya the religious
control exerted by the Pharaohs or Maya
shaman-kings is illustrated in art on artefacts
and temple walls . 
Typically the more powerful figures are larger
and wear more elaborate costumes . Their
subjects , or those they have defeated , are
smaller and sometimes depicted naked and
bowed or lying face down . For example , most
Egyptian temples have ‘ smiting scenes ’ on their
walls . These show the pharaoh holding a mace
in his upraised right arm with which he is
about to dash out the brains of captives held by
their hair in his left hand . The captives are
shown in submissive poses and are usually
clearly identified as racially distinct from their
Egyptian captors . At Edfu the pharaoh
Ptolemy XII Neos Dionysos is shown grasping
his prisoners by their topknots about to slay
them . However , he is not known to have
actually waged any wars . The subject matter of
the relief is purely conventional . 
THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF RANK AND
STATUS
These terms are often used interchangeably but
do have slightly different meanings . Status is
associated with social prestige ; rank implies a
position within a hierarchy . Both status and
rank may be inherited or acquired during life
by an individual . Ascribed status is where an
individual inherits social position , usually at
birth , for example being born into royalty . 
Achieved status is where the individual earns
or obtains position due to efforts during their

life , for example qualifying as a doctor . Rich
burials of children are often interpreted as
evidence of ascribed status . 
Archaeologists employ a number of sources of
evidence in their attempts to recognise status in
past societies . In a few cases such studies are
text-aided but in general they have to rely on
material culture to provide answers . All of the
main approaches try to isolate particular
variables that will allow differentiation between
sectors of a society and between individuals : 
242 ■ ARCHAEOLOGY COURSEBOOK
KEY STUDY
The Palette of Narmer
This cosmetic artefact excavated at the Egyptian city of Hierakonpolis dates from 3000 BC , 
the period just before the First Dynasty when the rules and icons of kingship were being
established . It is considered a classic example of the manipulation of iconography in support of
an individual ’ s status . 
The king ’ s name is written in hieroglyphs at the top , surrounded by a frame which is
reminiscent of the architecture of the royal palace . The catfish ( Nar ) and chisel ( mer ) spell out
the Horus name of the king , Narmer . He is depicted below in a standard pose . The king stands , 
left hand clasping the topknot of a kneeling captive , with a mace in his right hand . The
hieroglyphs tell us that the prisoner ’ s name is ‘ Wash ’  . The design immediately above him shows
a falcon on papyrus plants pulling back the head of a figure who looks remarkably like Wash
and is to be identified with the Nile delta . The main figure is wearing the white crown of Upper
Egypt and a flywhisk , early symbols of kingship . Below are defeated enemies and a sign that
represents a fortified town . We are clearly being told that the king has won a victory over an
enemy in the north , the delta . 
On the right-hand side of the palette the king , carrying the mace and flail , and this time
wearing the red crown of Lower Egypt , is explicitly labelled and accompanied by standard
bearers called ‘ The Followers of Horus ’  . They march within a panel that represents the gate of
the royal palace , towards two rows of bound and decapitated prisoners . The dead prisoners are
now powerless and reduced to order , compared with the figures on the other side who have
spread-eagled limbs . This may be symbolic of the Egyptian concept of order . In the central
panel are two mythological beasts with their long necks entwined to symbolise harmony and
perhaps the unification of the two lands of Egypt . This is echoed by the two crowns , which
would later be incorporated into the ‘ Double Crown ’  , indicating that the pharaoh was ‘ The Lord
of the Two Lands ’  . At the bottom right is a raging bull , representing the king ’ s anger , trampling
a man and a walled city . There is a balance in the composition , with harmony offsetting the
violence , but the message is abundantly clear . The enemies of Narmer can have been in no
doubt as to what lay in store for those who defied him . 
Kemp 1993
Burial evidence
Personal status is often suggested on the basis
of grave goods . Rich burials of individuals such
as those at Sutton Hoo , Varna and Bush
Barrow are usually interpreted as being the
graves of high status individuals . Sometimes
there is additional evidence to confirm this , as
in the cases of Tutankhamun and the royal
scribe burial at Copan ( see p . 230 )  . The latter
was identified from its central location , rich
grave goods and human sacrifices and from the 
 ‘ health ’ of the skeleton , which had little sign of
wear . This burial , on a balance of probabilities , 
represented the royal scribe and son of Copan ’ s
greatest king , Smoke Imix . 
In the Royal Cemetery at Ur , mortuary
practice involved the sacrifice of attendants
with royalty . The grave of Pu-abi included a
40-year-old woman who is identified as a
queen on a sealstone buried with her . She was
accompanied by exotic objects , including a lyre
with a golden bull ’ s head decoration , gold and

silver vessels , a magnificent headdress of golden
leaves and rosettes and twenty-three of her
courtiers . These ‘ victims ’ seem to have gone to
their deaths willingly as there was no sign of
coercion . Human sacrifice to accompany the
dead may be aimed at establishing the power
and status of an individual . Equally there are
many instances where such behaviour is a ritual
full of meaning for the whole community in
terms of the fertility of the earth or the
continuity of cyclical events . 
However , we need to take care that we don ’ t
impose our values and assume that certain
materials held the same value and prestige in
past societies as in our own . In some cases
symbolic associations may be an equally
important factor in the choice of raw material , 
such as jade in Mesoamerica . Even the gold at
Varna ( see cover ) may not be what it seems . 
Some of the richest graves there are empty 
 ‘ cenotaphs ’  . It may be that the gold represents
offerings from the living rather than the
belongings of the deceased . A further complication occurs with vessels such as beakers . Their
contents may have been the material of greatest
value rather than the pottery . Other organic
materials such as textiles , food or wood may
have been placed in what to us appear to have
been ‘ poor ’ graves , but these rarely survive . 
Parker-Pearson 1999
Status is only likely to be represented in death
where the person held that status at death . In
cases where status or rank did not stay with the
individual for their whole life it may not be
visible . Similarly , where beliefs dictate that
people should appear equal in death ( as in
Christian burial )  , indicators of status may be
absent . In general , ascribed status is more likely
to be visible than achieved status . The position
of burials , their orientation and any funerary
monument associated with them can also be
used to examine status . 
Settlement evidence
Status can also be inferred from settlement
evidence . Settlements that in themselves are
viewed as high status due to size or quality of
artefacts are generally expected to be the homes
of high status individuals . The palaces at
Knossos and the hill fort at Danebury ( see 
p . 180 ) have both been interpreted in this way . 
High status individuals might be expected to
have different houses from other people . The
energy expenditure model can be applied here
too . Houses may simply be bigger because the
inhabitants have more to store or may have
larger household units . They may also occupy
a prominent position . Eighteenth-century
landowners chose to build in prominent
positions in the landscape to emphasise control
over land . Rich merchants in earlier periods
clustered in central positions in towns . In many

Branc
Shennan ’ s ( 1975 ) study examined a major
cemetery and tried to assign values to
types of grave good in order to establish
social differentiation in terms of gender
and age . Instead of assuming that what we
might value , for example gold , was of most
value in the past he used other measures . 
The key one was energy expenditure . In
other words , artefacts that required more
skill , effort and resources from long
distances were likely to have been most
prized . 
cases the houses will be larger , more elaborate
and built of better quality materials – part of a
general display of wealth and status , which
might also include dress and visible forms of
consumption . Romano-British villas , for
example Chedworth , and palaces , for example
Fishbourne , can be compared to see the relative
differences in status between them . The layout
of a site may reveal individual status through
the control of space and therefore the way
people relate to each other . Higher status
people are also more likely to enclose their
property in a more visible way than are others . 
These aspects and the control of space and
access can clearly be traced in medieval castles
and monasteries and in earlier sites such as
brochs ( see p . 185 )  . 
Artefactual evidence
Concentrations of valuable finds can be used to
suggest locations used by important
individuals . Evidence of long-distance trade in
exotic or prestige goods or of the craft
workshops of attached specialists can also be
important . Value in these cases is usually
assigned in terms of the effort or energy which
went into their construction . Particular types 
of artefact may also be significant . Fine
weapons , ornaments and feasting equipment 
are all associated with chiefs and kings . 
Sherratt ’ s ( 1997 ) analysis of bell beakers
suggests that these were part of a wider chiefly
assemblage which included battle axes , horses
and , ultimately , individual burials in barrows . 
He interpreted the beakers as part of a 
drinking culture , perhaps in imitation of the
metal drinking and feasting vessels of classical
Greece . The association of elite warriors and
feasting has echoes in the archaeological 
record of the Iron Age , in the Saxon and
Viking period and until well into the Middle
Ages . 
THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF GENDER
Archaeologists usually distinguish between sex , 
which is biologically determined , and gender , 
which is regarded as a social construct . Gender
is the identity assigned to different sexes . In
any human society there is at the very least
some difference between the roles of men and
women . This stems from the fact that women
give birth and that there are obvious anatomical
differences between male and female . Gender
explains these differences and specifies what is
to be done about them . There is tremendous
variation from one society to another . In the
early stages of hominid development , males
were up to twice the size of females but this
distinction had largely disappeared by the time
modern humans emerged . Paradoxically , gender
differences were far more extreme in late
nineteenth- and early twentieth-century West
European societies , than they were among
historically known food-foraging peoples .

KEY TASK
Investigating status and rank in your
settlement
Identify some useful criteria for identifying
status and rank in your community . House
prices may be one guide ; local information
on occupation and earnings by electoral
ward may also be available . Focusing on
the built environment ( houses , gardens , 
enclosures , not cars )  , use observation to
compare different areas . Identify whether
there are visible indicators of rank and
status and what they are . Present this in
diagrammatic form . 
Assumptions about ‘ natural ’ roles and their
significance profoundly influenced the
development of archaeology up to the 1970s . 
In particular , males were portrayed as the active
sex in human evolution . For example , hunting
was seen as the key humanising activity in
evolution . Since then the importance of
scavenging and the likely role of women in 
the transition from gathering to horticulture
has been recognised . Even among the ! Kung
bushmen , often seen as archetypal hunters , 
women actually contributed much more
protein to the daily intake of the group than
did the men . Hunting was very hit and miss , 
while gathering of wild plant foods made up
60–80 per cent of the ! Kung diet . 
As with most areas of archaeology , 
ethnographic study has been employed to gain
insights into task differentiation between males
and females . One weakness in this approach
has been that most anthropologists have been
male . This has led to criticism that they are
more interested in male activities and have
failed to observe female tasks and behaviour . 
If this is true then we need to be particularly
cautious in transferring such observations to
archaeological material . A further point to 
be borne in mind is that gender is rarely 
just two opposite identities , and if we are 
to avoid stereotypical responses we should
treat gender as a continuum – a curve along
which individuals are placed from female to
male , according to the norms of particular
societies . 
Studies of gender have relied heavily on burial
evidence including human remains and grave
goods . Settlement and architectural analysis and
artistic sources , where they survive , have
supplemented this . 
Human remains
Differential evidence of disease can be used to
identify gendered patterns of activity or
consumption . Canadian Inuit hunter-gatherers
from the 1890s show osteoarthritis in the right
hand and jaw of women , combined with tooth
loss . These women spent considerable time
preparing skins and sewing . They made the
thread by rolling sinews against their cheeks . 
Areas most pressured by this activity reveal
damage . The men hunted with harpoons , which
sometimes caused disease of the right shoulder
and elbow , while kayak paddling also resulted
in distinctive wear of the bones . Other studies
of damage and wear have identified genderspecific activities as diverse as basket-making , 
fighting and grinding corn . 
The quantity and quality of food consumed
may relate to status . Chemical analysis of
prehistoric Native American skeletons show
that women have a higher strontium : calcium
ratio than men in the same community . This
may indicate that they ate a smaller share of the
available meat . However , strontium levels also
alter when a woman is pregnant or breastfeeding . Differential care and nutrition of
female and male children might also show up
in X-ray analysis of bones . Lines of increased
bone density , known as Harris lines , reflect
periods of malnutrition during growth . 
Graves and grave goods
The association of male and female burials 
with different ranges of grave goods has been
noted in many cultures . From the Neolithic
onwards arrowheads , daggers and other
weapons are frequently found in male and not
female burials , which seems to confirm that
these activities were male-dominated even by
the prehistoric period . From the Bronze Age
246 ■ ARCHAEOLOGY COURSEBOOK
women were regularly buried with a variety of
ornaments and jewellery such as pins , necklaces
and bracelets . While this may indicate different
roles in life there are problems with this
analysis . Until recently , sexing of burials often
relied on the grave goods . Jewellery without
weapons were expected to be female graves so
these finds were used to define female burials . 
Today there is less confidence in this interpretation . DNA analysis at West Heslerton ( see
p . 187 ) showed that some females were buried
with weapons and some men with jewellery . 
Many museums are currently reviewing their
labelling of burials . Whether beautiful objects
are just jewellery and whether daggers are
always indicative of fighting has also been
questioned . Spear-throwers have been found in
some female burials of the mid-western Indian

Tell Abu Hureyra
Having sexed and aged the skeletons at this Neolithic site , Molleson found distinct differences
between the sexes in terms of patterns of wear on their bones and of associated degenerative
diseases such as arthritis . The male skeletons showed lesions and strain in the arms such as
might be associated with throwing spears . This fitted well with the faunal evidence for hunting
gazelle ( see p . 206 )  . Female skeletons show heavy wear of the big toe , knee , thigh , pelvis 
and lower back . Today this might be termed ‘ repetitive strain injury ’ and was clearly caused by
regular motion backwards and forwards of some duration . The querns , which were used for
plant processing on the site , would have to be used for several hours a day by each family to
obtain enough ground wheatflour to satisfy their needs . Using a quern necessitated kneeling
down using the big toe curled under as a lever and pushing the top stone of the quern to and
fro , sometimes hyper-extending the muscles of thigh and back if the stone was pushed too hard
or too far . Over a lifetime this task would have caused the sort of damage and arthritis that
we see in the female skeletons at Tell Abu Hureyra . Molleson suggested that women and their
daughters would have shared this laborious work . 
Another distinctive pattern were grooves in the sides of some of the female teeth on each side 
of the jaw . Ethnographic parallels suggested that this resulted from drawing fibres through the
teeth to work and soften them as a preliminary stage in making baskets . This hints at the
beginnings of craft production on a household level , a factor also indicated by the survival to a
good old age of some individuals without teeth ( the empty sockets had closed over during life )  . 
This would not have been possible without the ability to prepare soft foods , probably initially
using sieves of basketwork and later of ceramics . A final indicator of gender roles lies in the
discovery that women were most often buried under the floor of the house , suggesting strongly
that this was their area of activity and their domain in life . 
Fagin 1995
Knoll culture of the third millennium BC . Were
they just ceremonial or to do with inheritance , 
or did women as well as men hunt ? 
Rich male graves are often interpreted in terms
of what he earned or won , whereas when a
woman is found with elaborate grave goods
they are often attributed to her husband or
father . For example , if women over a certain
age have certain grave goods and younger ones
do not , it may be argued that these represent
goods transferred at marriage . The possibility
that women have achieved their own wealth is
rarely considered . Examples of high status Iron
Age female burials include those at Wetwang
Slack , which features a ‘ chariot ’ burial
surrounded by rich grave goods , and the Vix
Burial at Saone , which has a gold torc , huge
Greek bronze krater ( wine-mixing vessel ) and
decorated metal bowls . A different kind of
status may be visible in the female graves at
Khok Phanom Di where craft specialisation
seems to have played a role in achieving higher
social ranking . The Pazyryk ‘ Ice Maiden ’ also
suggests high status based on a particular
talent . 

icemummies / remains . html
Differential survival can be an issue when
studying gender differences . In the Mesolithic
period men , and especially older men , appeared
to receive special treatment , being buried with
ochre , antlers or stone artefacts . However , if
women had grave goods of organic materials , 
perhaps offerings of plant foods and medicinal
herbs rather than joints of meat , and tools or
ornaments of wood , these would not have
survived . 
Settlement evidence
Studies which have used differential distribution of artefacts to identify male and female
activity areas , such as Clarke ( 1972 ) at
Glastonbury or Flannery and Marcus at Guila
Naquitz , could be criticised for making
assumptions about gendered tasks . For
example , the complete absence of large men ’ s
fingerprints on pottery at Khok Phanom Di
might argue against the involvement of adult
men in potting . However , while small fingerprints could have belonged to women potters
they could also be those of young assistants . 
More recently , studies of architecture have been
used to explore the way in which societies
structured gender in the past . Gilchrist ’ s ( 1995 ) 
study of the relationship between ideas of
chivalry and gender roles and the different
zones of medieval castles is a good example .

The Birdlip princess
This rich Iron Age burial from the middle
of three barrows contained a mirror , a
range of jewellery including amber and
shale objects , and some bronze bowls . It
was interpreted as a rich woman ’ s grave
and some speculated that it might even be
that of Boudicca . However , recent
examination of the skull has shown that it
has masculine traits . The assemblage is
also notable in that the artefacts have all
been broken and one of the vessels was
placed over the face of the skeleton . Could
it be the burial of a male shaman rather
than a princess ? Another burial was
discovered in 1999 in the Scilly Isles with
similar characteristics . 
Artistic sources
Depictions of males and females in scenes on
pottery , reliefs , wall paintings and metal
artefacts have been quarried for information
about gender roles . Some appear fairly straightforward and provide evidence for a division of
labour . Pottery from Sopron , Hungary , from
the sixth century BC shows figures which seem
to be women engaged in weaving and spinning : 
one is dancing or praying while another figure , 
which may also be female , is playing a lyre . 
Men in comparison are riding horses , herding
animals and leading horse-drawn wagons . 
Other material is more ambivalent . A depiction
of a person gathering wild honey from a tree at
Bicorp , in Spain , from 7000–4000 BC has been
interpreted as both male and female by
different commentators . The majority have
assumed it is a woman due to the size of the
buttocks and the flowing hair . 
Even where artistic images are clearly of
females or males , they cannot always be taken
at face value . At Knossos ( see p . 212 ) a series
of figurines of bare-breasted women with fulllength skirts has been found . They frequently
have snakes twined round their arms . There are
also frescoes which show women and men
involved in various activities . They are easily
distinguished as the Minoans adopted the
convention of painting the skins of women
white while those of men are painted brown . 
Women are depicted more commonly than
men . Taken at face value it seems that elite
women may have had more status and the right
to participate in a wider range of activities than
women in many other societies . Some writers
have gone further and suggested this is
evidence of a matriarchal ( headed by women ) 
society . However , representation cannot in
itself be taken as evidence of high status , nor
can we assume that the women depicted are
typical . A similar debate has raged over
Palaeolithic ‘ Venus figurines ’  . These images of
pregnant female figures have been found across
Europe and are remarkably uniform in
character and style . Most appear to be
associated with hearths and home bases . They
are made of a variety of materials including
baked clay ( Dolni Vestonice )  , mammoth ivory 
( Lespugue ) and limestone ( Willendorf )  . 
Interpretations have ranged from mother
goddesses through fertility symbols to
primitive pornography . 
Until recently , sexuality in the past was rarely
considered by archaeologists . Indeed , in several
countries collections of artefacts with sexual
imagery are often kept from public view . In
1999 the British Museum faced a dilemma over
whether to display a rare Roman vase that
depicted homosexual sex . A recent survey of
knowledge about sexuality in the archaeological
record appears in Taylor ( 1997 )  .

SOCIAL ARCHAEOLOGY ■ 249
Figure 11 . 8 Drawing of a classical vase . 
Artistic sources have been used to provide
information not only on what people looked like
but also on social organisation and values
POPULATION AND ETHNICITY
Demographic information about past
populations is largely obtained from human
remains . Where there are large collections from
cemeteries they can reveal information about
the age and sex structure of the population , 
average height and life expectancy of adults as
well as common illnesses and injuries . DNA
offers the opportunity to explore relationships
between people and to determine how
homogenous any population was . It has also
been critical in tracing the evolution of
humans . Artistic sources and preserved bodies
can fill in details of appearance . 
Ethnicity and race have the same relationship
as sex and gender . One of each pair is in our
DNA , the other is in our heads . Racially we
are all Homo sapiens but ethnicity consists of
cultural norms and values that differentiate one
social group from another . Physical differences
are sometimes , but not always , used to
distinguish different ethnic groups . 
Until the later twentieth century cultural
approaches to archaeology tended to dominate
interpretations . In some cases they were used
to support racist political ideas , such as Nazi
archaeology identifying particular ceramic
styles with the territory of ancient ( Germanic ) 
tribes ( see p . 121 )  . Such approaches also led
to a diffusionist ‘ invasions model ’ of social
change in Britain with successive waves of
invaders bringing developments and their own
special pottery , for example , Windmill Hill
Folk or Beaker People . This idea fitted with
colonial experience of worldwide progress
flowing from more ‘ civilised ’ to ‘ backward ’ 
peoples , but it has been shown to be deeply
flawed by the application of scientific techniques . Stonehenge is the most famous case . A
generation of classically trained archaeologists 
had shown how the people of Bronze Age
Wessex built monuments in imitation and with
help from advanced Mediterranean civilisations . 
Yet radiocarbon dating has shown that Stonehenge pre-dated the Mediterranean monuments
it was supposed to have been influenced by . 
This cultural model of social change tends to
undervalue the achievements of indigenous
people as in the case of Iron Age brochs 
( see p . 185 )  . In Neolithic studies the current
orthodoxy has shifted away from seeing all
change as due to migration . For example , while
the spread of farming in central Europe is
largely interpreted as colonisation , its eventual
adoption after the Neolithic standstill ( see 
p . 208 ) in north-western Europe is increasingly
seen as the result of choices made by local
foraging groups . 
Even where we know invasions took place , the
archaeological record is not always helpful . For
example , there is little evidence for the Norman
Conquest in sequences of medieval ceramics . 
Some evidence is ambivalent . Belgic coins
found in South East England from the late Iron
Age have been used to support Caesar ’ s
description of immigration into the area from
Gaul . However , there are other mechanisms by
which the coins could have got there . As with
other forms of identity , where ethnic
allegiances are expressed in organic material
such as textiles , evidence may not always
survive .

KEY SITES
Pompeii and Herculaneum
Recent developments at these two Roman towns , destroyed by Mount Vesuvius in AD 79 , 
provide an insight into the way archaeology has developed . The first excavations in 1748 were
a search for treasure to adorn royal palaces . Today the material evidence is painstakingly
studied to try and bring an ancient culture to life . 
Classical accounts , particularly Pliny ’ s letters , led to a view of a cosmopolitan population being
entombed in ash at Pompeii or engulfed in mud at Herculaneum by the sudden eruption . The
ghoulish plaster casts of victims have been
used in conjunction with the range of goodlooking people on the wall paintings to
illustrate this view . Vulcanologists have now
shown that the eruption did not happen
without warning . Evidence for grand villas
being taken over by squatters who hung
agricultural implements over grand wall
paintings suggests that many of those who
could had left . Statistical analysis of the piles
of disarticulated bones in the basements of
Pompeii has yielded a picture of the ‘ average
Pompeian ’  . Skull deformities suggest a group
of closely related people and a high
proportion of older women . This suggests that
ideas about Roman lifespans may be wrong . 
If women survived childbirth then they had a
strong chance of surviving to a good age , even
approximating modern levels . The high number
of older people also suggests a grim scenario
– that they were the ones left behind ! 
Conversely , early excavations at Herculaneum
suggested that the town was abandoned long before the final eruption since so few bodies had
been found . That idea changed dramatically in 1982 when excavations on the waterfront of
Herculaneum uncovered hundreds of skeletons in the arches facing onto the beach . These may
reveal more details of population structure .

SOCIAL CHANGE
Most periods will have examples of social
changes to which you will be directed . The
kind of evidence discussed in this chapter and
those on economics and settlement will provide
the focus for work on this area . Studying social
change is likely to require you to discuss a
range of different models to account for

KEY STUDY
Saxons and Britons
Historical sources suggest that Anglo-Saxon invaders slaughtered or displaced native RomanoBritish people from much of England in the fifth and sixth centuries AD . On the assumption
that ‘ Germanic type ’ artefacts equalled Saxon invaders , archaeological material was used to
trace the arrival and spread of migrants across the country . Similarly , areas where Saxon
pottery or metalwork was absent were identified as places still held by Britons . There are a
series of problems with this version of events . First , the material itself . In some areas such as
East Anglia or Oxfordshire it can be difficult to differentiate Saxon from Romano-British
Greyware or Iron Age pottery , unless it is decorated . Where it can be identified , it sometimes
turns up well before historical sources say the Saxons arrived , for example at Eynsham Abbey . 
This may illustrate the point that ethnically distinctive material may be used by other groups . 
Exchange , trade , small-scale migration or adoption and copying by indigenous people would
also spread material . 
Harke ’ s ( 1990 ) study of Anglo-Saxon cemeteries suggested that they included RomanoBritons , thus indicating co-existence . Male burials with swords were on average 1–2 inches
taller than those without . This was not due to different diets and suggested two distinct ethnic
groups . By the seventh century this distinction had disappeared , probably through
intermarriage . DNA analysis of several cemeteries revealed two models of Anglo-Saxon
immigration . In some , complete kin groups were represented , which points to separate
communities , while in others , males with weapons existed alongside female skeletons , showing
continuity with the Romano-British period . Harke terms this the ‘ warband ’ model . Over time , 
DNA evidence supports a mingling of the two populations into ‘ the English ’ while the dominant
culture remained ‘ Anglo-Saxon ’  . Analysis of the feet from burials at Lechlade cemetery by
Jackson ( 1995 ) also pointed to great local population continuity . Settlement data , for example
West Heslerton ( see p . 187 )  , supports this view . Some recent studies have noted that swords
found with burials were not always robust models and were also found with women . This may
suggest that they had a symbolic value rather than identifying male warriors . 
For detail and links on Anglo-Saxon cemeteries see the website below .

change . Essentially these will fall into two
groups . External factors include immigration , 
diffusion , conquest and environmental change . 
Internal factors include evolution , competition
and innovation . You need to ensure you
examine and appraise an appropriate range of
these . The adoption of agriculture provides a
good model of this and the Pizza exercise 
( see p . 258 ) is a useful way of ranking your
theories . In examining change don ’ t forget the
opposite : stasis . For much of the time things
remain as they are , and that needs explaining
too . A useful tool for examining forces for
change or stasis is the force field diagram 
( see p . 210 )  . 
SOCIAL CONFLICT
Not all social conflict is violent . Probably its
most common form is competition in either
display or consumption . Our society is no
different in this respect . Various attempts have
been made to trace this sort of competition
from the Neolithic onwards . Tilley ( 1996 ) 
suggested that developments in the design of
Swedish passage graves might have been the
product of local competitive emulation . Other
writers have come to similar conclusions about
the henges of Wessex , an idea that was taken up
by Cornwell in his 1999 blockbuster novel , 
Stonehenge . 
Warfare
In literate societies , warfare is one of the first
things to be documented . It seems likely that in
societies with oral traditions it forms a major
part of their history too . From Homer we
know something of the wars of Bronze Age
Greece while medieval recording of Irish and
Icelandic sagas may provide insights into Iron
Age warfare in north-western Europe . Tomb

Figure 11 . 11 The massive bastions of the Hanoverian base at Fort George near Inverness . Its 
state-of-the-art defences were probably impregnable in the late eighteenth century . However , this
monument rarely saw any fighting and has continued to be used by the military up to the present . 
Was its symbolic importance , as a massive statement of royal power in the Highlands , more crucial ? 
paintings and inscriptions in most of the
classical civilisations of Eurasia and
Mesoamerica provide graphic depiction of the
nature of battles . However , all these accounts
tend to be very stylised and to focus on key
individuals or heroes . There is much that
archaeology can add to help understand both
fighting and strategy . 
Apart from historic and artistic accounts , the
physical evidence of weapons and fortification
usually provide the main sources for
identifying warfare . In some cases actual battles
become visible . For instance , the ‘ war grave ’ at
Maiden Castle with its famous iron arrowhead
embedded in a defender ’ s spine , or the mass
grave at Towcester which was recently
subjected to detailed analysis in terms of the
sequence of events and the injuries visible on
each individual . 
Of course , not everything that looks military
may have been . Both weapons and fortifications can be symbolic . Early metal daggers

Trajan ’ s Column
This monumental pillar in Rome commemorates the conquests of the Emperor Trajan in
his campaigns against the Dacians . Scenes
show in tremendous detail the equipment and
organisation involved in the campaign . The
battle scenes depict the tactics used by the
legions and their effectiveness . The key events
of the campaign are included and its effects , 
allowing for some bias , are also illustrated . 
Figure 11 . 12 Artistic sources on warfare
tend to tell the victor ’ s version of events . 
Consequently , we approach them with some
care as exact records of evidence . However , 
their unwitting evidence of equipment and
organisation can be valuable . Trajan ’ s
Column provides a superb example
and ‘ rapiers ’ were relatively fragile . While they
could have been used to kill , they would have
been less effective than flint-tipped spears or
stone axes . The swords that emerge in the
Bronze Age are quite a different matter . Their
shape and balance suggest that they were ideal
for slashing at opponents in fighting at close
quarters . Analysis of their edges has shown
that many have damage associated with metalon-metal contact . Fortifications can also
mislead us about the nature of warfare .  ‘ Hill
forts ’ with their massive circuits of ramparts
suggest sieges . There is evidence of attack at a
few , such as flint arrowheads around the
entrance at Crickley Hill , but these are
exceptions . Warfare in the Iron Age is more
likely to have looked like a cattle raid than
pitched battles between rival armies , at least
until the Romans arrived . A similar bias would
occur if we looked at the major physical
evidence of warfare between France and
Germany in 1940 . The Maginot Line , bypassed
by the Germans , is still visible while traces of
mobile tank and infantry formations are harder
to discern .

Scales of justice
The ability to reach supported conclusions is expected at A Level and above . Learning how to
reach judgements takes time and requires confidence building . One way of doing this is through
short exercises where you get used to quickly summing up strengths and weaknesses . A simple
task is to take three or four methods and list their advantages and disadvantages for
particular tasks or in general . If you present the information in graphical form you are more
likely to remember it . Adapting the scales of justice is a popular version . Try this as
preparation for the next piece of work you have on methods .

Success 
and Beyond

Most courses , including A Level , require
students to undertake a piece of personal
research and submit their findings for
assessment . This may be called coursework , a
personal study or simply an archaeological
investigation . Whatever its title it will have a
set of written instructions as to the precise
nature of your task . This will include guidance
on what you must eventually produce and in
which format . While this chapter cannot
address these particular requirements , it covers
issues which are common to most students ’ 
experiences and needs . You should keep your
specific research brief to hand as you read
through this section . The real examples
included in the section are all based on good 
A Level projects . 
HOW TO CHOOSE A TOPIC
Study the assignment brief issued to you . 
It may include constraints such as the word 
 ‘ local ’ or you may need to undertake some 
 ‘ first-hand ’ observation . It is essential that you
choose a subject that fits the requirements of
your course , is based on evidence which is
accessible to you and , most importantly , is
something on which you will enjoy working . 
It must be archaeological
Archaeology embraces many other academic
disciplines and sources in attempting to
understand past cultures . These range from
biology through geology to architecture . It is

■ how to record sites and materials
■ what to include and how to present your study . 
common to find overlap emerging in a project . 
Graveyard surveys , for example , link strongly
to social and economic history while studies of
hedgerows will require some botanical
knowledge . While links to other disciplines are
clearly valid you must consider balance . 
Archaeological content should dominate the
final work . For example , analysis of the
structural evidence for different phases of
building within a medieval castle is archaeological whereas exploring events and
personalities linked to its use are usually of a
historical nature . A general rule of thumb is
that archaeology deals directly with the
physical remains of the past whilst history is
more concerned with analysing events using
documentary sources . 
You must be able to access your sources
Being able to visit your chosen sites or
monuments , or conduct research within a
museum or archaeological unit should be high
on your agenda . Research benefits from a firsthand approach and it is more than likely that
you will need to make more than a single visit
to your source ( s ) of evidence . A first visit –
probably following initial research in the
library – will be to familiarise yourself with the
object of your study . You need to get a feel for
the extent of the site ( s ) under review or the
range of artefacts available . Follow-up visits
will be required for more detailed research . 
This might include surveying earthworks or
sorting and drawing artefacts . Often students
find that there are points they missed on
previous visits which can be checked on later
ones . If you have chosen sites at too great a
distance such opportunities to revisit may be
impractical . This is particularly true when
students are tempted to select sites overseas . 
Your holiday visit to Pompeii may have fired
your archaeological imagination but is unlikely
to have resulted in meaningful research and the
cost of a later visit to check measurements
makes this a rather expensive option . Sites
within range of home , school or college are
your best bet . 
Access does not just mean closeness . There are
other people such as landowners involved . 
Public rights of way can be found in OS maps
while better known sites are listed in
gazetteers , often with directions for access . But
in many cases there is no easy or direct
footpath . Regardless of the pending ‘ right to
roam ’ legislation , if the site is on somebody ’ s
land you will need their permission to visit it . 
This is even more important if you want to
survey it . In 1999 a gamekeeper chased a
student away from a stone circle in Derbyshire . 
His project was delayed for months while he
then tried to get written permission from the
landowner . It would have been better to have
done this first . It is sometimes difficult to
discover who owns particular fields so build in
time to find out and consider fallback projects
in case permission is refused or you don ’ t
receive a reply . If you hope to use an artefact
collection , you need to check with the keeper
that this is possible and determine when you
can have access to it . To give yourself the best
opportunity in all cases , write early in your
research programme , explain briefly your
reasons for wanting access to the land or
collection and offer a range of suitable times
when you could visit . A stamped self-addressed
envelope may add a degree of success to the
response rate . Permission should be obtained
from the site manager if you are studying an
excavation and want to record more than a few
cursory notes or photographs . 
It is easy to get caught out with access issues . 
A common excuse for shortfall in studies is
that sites or museums were closed at the time
262 ■ ARCHAEOLOGY COURSEBOOK
the student tried to pay a visit . A phone call in
advance would have found this out . A more
difficult situation is where the site is accessible
but it is overgrown with vegetation . Summer
grass or bracken growth can easily mask
relatively minor features such as hut circles or
medieval village remains . Winter is often the
best time to visit earthworks but the
enthusiastic student can still be caught out : one
keen fieldworker had to wait several weeks for
snow to melt on Bodmin Moor before his
barrow survey could be undertaken . 
Supporting literature will vary in quantity
according to the topic selected . Key texts to
establish a context for your research are usually
essential as most studies benefit from an
understanding of the relevant background . 
If you find too many books on your subject it
will run the risk of lacking originality and it
might be better to reconsider your focus . On
the other hand , it is possible , as the case studies
show , to identify an aspect of our material past
where there is little direct written material on
which to draw . This should not dissuade you
from continuing , as there are many untapped
areas of archaeological potential . It is easier to
say something new about the pattern of round
barrows or pillboxes near your home than it
would be to say something original about
Hadrian ’ s Wall . You should seek advice from
your tutor on background reading and sources
whatever your topic . Access to this material is
also easier if it is a local site or collection . If
your school or college does not have much , 
local museums and libraries probably will .

You also need to find the correct balance of
available evidence to study . Too much and you
run the risk of superficiality , too little and the
problem will be achieving a meaningful
outcome . The curator of your local museum
might welcome an apparently sensible and
enthusiastic student who offers to catalogue
their Romano-British pottery collection ; a
concentration on just the Samian ware might in
reality be more feasible and appropriate for
your study . If you do work with a third party
such as a local archaeologist be sure to seek
their professional advice but always refer back
to your tutor who will best understand the
requirements of your study . 
So the first stage in your research is to ensure
adequate and appropriate sources and access to
them . Often at this stage some change may be
needed to the original title in the light of your
findings . 
BASIC RESEARCH OPPORTUNITIES
The archaeological evidence to underpin any
study usually comes from field evidence within
the landscape , whether urban or rural , or
artefactual evidence . The range within both
these sources is vast and offers many
possibilities for work at different levels . 
GCSE students
■ Two short pieces of work . A whole group is
likely to work on the same questions . 
■ One piece describes sites , features or field
studies and interprets them at a general level
in the context of its period . The second
piece identifies and interprets a collection of
material , usually artefacts . Recovery , 
conservation and preservation may also be
considered . 
■ High level responses show consistent and
detailed accuracy in observation , recording
and interpretation and include some
analytical outcomes . Full details are
available from the AQA syllabus . 

A Level students
■ At A2 level the personal investigation is one
of the three assessed modules . Each student
selects an individual choice of topic and
question . Access to HE assignments are
likely to be similar . 
■ Students must develop an investigation of a
question , issue or problem in an archaeological context . It has to be based on named
sites , monuments or museums and must
consider how archaeologists might approach
such an investigation . 
■ Pass level responses must go beyond a
straightforward factual account of evidence
they have identified . Evaluation and analysis
feature strongly in high level responses . Full
details from AQA . 

Undergraduate or HND students
■ No standard practice . Some courses require
research diaries on summer excavation
work , others set investigations similar to
those at A level in year 1 or 2 . 
■ Students may undertake research for their
extended essay or dissertation . Requirements vary from one university to another
but the focus of such work tends to be
sharper the higher one proceeds up the
academic ladder . 
Sites and monuments
All sites can be studied in terms of spatial
distribution and layout and their chronological

EXAMPLE 1
What evidence is there to suggest an Irish
influence on the portal tombs of Wales ?  
 ‘ Kate ’ began with a comparative study of
some portal tombs of south and north Wales
and Ireland – leaving Cornish and Scottish
examples outside the scope of the study . She
combined a desktop survey of excavation
reports with fieldwork . She hoped to discuss
distribution , construction , orientation , 
typography , material culture , mortuary
practices and chronology . However , few sites
had ‘ comprehensive ’ excavation reports and
therefore she reduced her commentary on
finds and mortuary practice and placed
greater emphasis on evidence from recording
surviving remains in the field . 
Sources
■ SMRs
■ Archaeological trusts
■ Key sites : Pembrokeshire ( 4 )  , Merioneth 
( 3 )  , Ireland ( 13 ) 
■ Museums : National Museum of Wales , 
National Museum and Library , Dublin
■ Wide bibliography including prehistory
texts and excavation reports
■ Contacts : three practising archaeologists
were contacted and all responded
Methodology
Kate established a background context from
literature and produced distribution maps and
commentary for the sites in Wales and
Ireland . She reviewed academic arguments
and established a hypothesis that there was
an Irish origin / influence for Welsh sites . Her
recording of sites included details of location , 
height above sea level , siting , orientation , style
and material of construction . Where possible
details of internal structure and reports on
burial rites were also included . 
Content / discussion
Kate began by considering definitions of
portal tombs as types of megalithic structure
and acknowledging the limitations of the
evidence for burial rites . She then made a
range of detailed comparisons and contrasts
including statistical tables . She examined
different theories in depth and commented on
each against the evidence she had gathered . 
She went on to reflect on other Irish / Welsh
influences of the time in terms of ‘ passage ’ 
graves and axe trade . Her conclusion noted
that evidence is open to interpretation but
having weighed the evidence she outlined a
sustainable argument . 
Additional illustrations included photographs
of twenty-three sites , two site plans and
drawings of typical Neolithic artefacts . She
acknowledged help and included an extensive
bibliography . Her field notes were placed in an
appendix .

development . Most can also be examined for
typological development . Investigations can
centre on any one , two or all of these factors to
facilitate the depth of research needed . Whatever
your choice of sites or monuments you should
never go alone when doing fieldwork . Apart
from the personal safety aspect , which cannot be
over-stressed , a companion can hold tapes or
discuss your observations with you . 
The extent of the task should have a strong
bearing on the selection of sites or monuments . 
Single sites may not always be sufficient . An
Iron Age hill fort allows for both desktop
research and field survey within the context of
its landscape ; a single pillbox would be too
restrictive but a collection of coastal defences a
sounder proposition . Studying a local group
allows comparison and contrast to be developed
which enables you to reveal your true archaeological investigative skills . Neolithic tombs
provide such an opportunity . These monuments
are widely distributed across western Europe
particularly on the Atlantic coasts . They are
chronologically distributed throughout the
Neolithic period . Distinct regional typologies
have been identified with styles ranging from
long barrows to stalled cairns . For many
students in the British Isles they are accessible
and can be adapted to suit almost any purpose in
terms of projects . A popular approach is to look
at their distribution in terms of the Neolithic
landscape , to establish original groupings or
clusters , or to compare orientation . Islands such
as Guernsey or Arran present obvious opportunities . Other approaches include comparing
inter-visibility or to report on the condition and
current threats to the monuments . 
Of course visible monuments , which include
those you can find on OS maps , are rather like
the tip of an iceberg . By far the greater
proportion of evidence of past activity is
hidden below ground . Those studies that only
reflect on visible evidence may well fail to deal
with the larger picture . Reference to aerial
photographs and SMR documentation is useful
in establishing evidence that cannot be
recorded or accessed in other ways . 
You may be also be able to consult the results
– usually published – of previous excavations
on the sites . You need to decide how much of
your evidence will be derived from such
sources and how much from your study of
unexcavated sites . Few personal studies achieve
high grades by simply paraphrasing the work
of others . Excavation reports are also a particularly difficult medium to summarise
effectively . However , if sites have been
excavated then you have no option but to
investigate via the site report or archive . 
Including a well-known site in a group study
of several sites such as Chedworth and other
Cotswold villas can lead to a loss of balance . 
The data on one site far outweighs that easily
obtainable on the others . This imbalance can be
countered by a title which lays the stress on the
better known site or which focuses on conservation and preservation issues . Sites with
guidebooks should carry a health warning for
students . They can seem a bonus when you are
hard-pressed for time but the availability of
such material can tempt you into producing a
study which owes too much to others ’ work . 
At worst this can turn into an archaeological
version of I-spy . 
Artefacts
The potential for studying artefacts is vast . 
These range from Palaeolithic stone tools to
relatively recent objects like clay pipes or
horseshoes . Materials could include ceramics , 
stone , bone , metal , organic remains and glass .

EXAMPLE 2
A survey of ground and polished stone and
flint axes from East Kent 
 ‘ Hamid ’ set out to examine finds from a small
area in some detail and to catalogue quantity , 
type and distribution . He hoped this might
shed some light on Neolithic settlement in the
region .

prehistory texts and articles in archaeological journals
Methodology
Much previous research has been related to
the petrological analysis ( via thin sectioning ) 
of axes to establish their source and the 
Figure 12 . 3 A type series of stone axes : the seven profiles against which the axes were matched
for typological analysis
However , artefacts are less frequently used as
source material for projects than sites and
monuments . This may reflect the pull of the
outdoors and landscape archaeology but
probably also stems from the greater barriers
that exist between the researcher and the
guardians of material culture . Artefacts are
most likely to be in museums or with archaeological units . Individual excavators or collectors
are less easy to identify as resources for
students . 
Most museum material is in storage . Some of it
will be fully catalogued . Curators tend to
display their better items so these objects are
often unusual rather than representative . 
To fully explore a museum ’ s holding of any
particular aspect of material culture will require
museum staff to locate and get out appropriate
evidence . Many will do this but will want
sufficient notice and a clear idea of what it is
you wish to study . Arrangements will have to
be made for frequent visits to work on the
material as cataloguing and drawing are timeconsuming activities . These can only be done
during opening times which may mean
Saturday or holiday appointments . 
EXAMPLE 2 cont . 
distribution patterns of products . Records on
125 axes were compiled from published data
and museum records . Hamid used a selfdevised sheet to list museum accession
number ; find spot ; stone type ; dimensions ; 
completeness ; condition ; presence of cortex ; 
other comments . The most complete were
sketched in outline for shape comparison . 
Using typology and analysis of size and
weight Hamid established a seven-type
classification with description and illustration
of one axe in each type . Charts were produced
to show number of axes per group . 
Having produced his catalogue , Hamid
evaluated it and discussed its implications for
understanding the archaeology of Neolithic
Kent . 
Content / discussion
Hamid acknowledged the difficulty in establishing an accurate number of axes . He
observed that some are held outside Kent
while others in Kentish museums were
unprovenanced . More were likely to be in
private collections and unpublished . Most
were chance finds but others could be linked
to archaeological sites or other Neolithic
material . The section on raw materials
acknowledged the work of others . Most axes
were made from local flint but petrological
analysis linked others to axe factories . He was
able to construct distribution maps with links
to known Neolithic sites and natural features . 
Further discussion centred on possible
implications of the findings for exchange and
identifying settlement and the function of the
axes themselves . 
Accompanying illustrations included location
maps , six tables of data and typological
drawings . No photographs were used ; the
project was acceptable without them . The
project listed acknowledgements and had a
comprehensive bibliography . The axe record
sheets were placed in an appendix . 
268 ■ ARCHAEOLOGY COURSEBOOK
Archaeological units hold most recently
excavated material and their time is even more
limited than that of museum staff . Their role is
not curatorial and it will need personal
introduction to access a part of their store of
artefacts . Some students obtain work
experience placements with units and may be
able to develop links through such activity . 
Other sources include local societies who may
do some excavation or , more rarely , local
excavators . Some metal detectorists might allow
a study of their findings – such a recording and
analysis could well prove fruitful . 
Fieldwalking
Some students use their links with museums , 
units , universities or landowners to identify
sites under the plough and arrange their own
fieldwalking exercise . If it is well researched
and planned this can lead to excellent , original
studies . Farmers need to be approached
sensitively for permission and in good time . 
Their schedule of activity needs to be known
so that you can organise the fieldwalk at a
convenient time both to them and yourself . 
You also need an initial visit to check that
archaeological material is visible in the topsoil . 
Try not to be overambitious and do get some
help . It takes longer to set up and walk an area
of a field systematically and gather the evidence
than you might think . Two students
fieldwalking a 200 metre square would walk
approximately 10 kilometres each . On
ploughed land that represents a considerable
expenditure of energy ! Washing , identifying
and analysing the finds will also take much
time . 
Archaeology from the modern period
Most archaeological texts focus on later
prehistory to the medieval period . However , 
this should not limit you and particularly if
you live in a built-up area , you may find it
easier to focus on standing buildings or more
recent structures . Students have studied
buildings ranging from docks to petrol stations . 
The remains of the industrial age and also of
the Second World War are particularly rich
sources for studies . 
Industrial archaeology including agricultural
evidence
Early transport systems such as canals and
railways often leave linear traces , now often
fading , of their routes . A keen eye for
landscape and interpretation backed by older
Ordnance Survey maps can be just what a
student researcher needs . Both wind and water
mills survive in a range of conditions and often
have constructional sequences that can be
ascribed to different phases of development . 
Where they have been converted into homes
you may find the owners rather proud to show
off original elements of the building . Mines are
often landscaped after their closure and the
danger of hidden shafts should discourage their
use as a source for study . However , harbours , 
their associated buildings and tramways may
survive in sufficient state to warrant investigation . Despite urban regeneration it is quite
possible to identify buildings whose original
purpose has now given way to new uses . 
Breweries , maltings , cinemas and mills all fall 
in this category . They lend themselves to
questions asking ,  ‘ To what extent can the
development and function of the remains at 
X be identified by archaeological survey ?  ’ 
There is a vast range of vernacular farm
buildings in the countryside . Even on modern
farms you may not have to look far to find
some older features . Records of this
diminishing archaeological resource are needed
and your study could add to them . One rural

 ‘ To what extent can a correlation be
established between air photographic
evidence and that revealed by
fieldwalking ?  ’ 
The Trent Valley in Nottinghamshire has
featured as a case study in two major
publications on aerial photography : A Matter
of Time by the Royal Commission on
Historical Monuments ( 1960 ) and their
subsequent study , written by Whimster , 
The Emerging Past ( 1989 )  .  ‘ Cara ’ chose to
fieldwalk two fields that had produced
cropmarks to establish whether the pattern 
of finds reflected the location of the features
in the air photographs . In other words to see
how closely these two methods of site identification matched . 
Sources

■ Trent and Peak Archaeological Trust – air

■ Practical fieldwalking guides
■ Texts on regional air photography and site
identification
■ Teacher and SMR staff assistance with
artefact identification
Methodology
Preliminary research at the Trent and Peak
Unit showed Cara that most fields in the
target area had revealed cropmarks . She
gaining access permission and dates of
ploughing from local farmers then selected
fields that were due to be ploughed . Next she
created a collage of cropmarks from the 
collection of photographs of all angles and
heights that she had located by grid reference
at the local archaeological unit . The
cropmarks within the target fields were scaled
and drawn onto plans . 
Local volunteers comprising family , friends
and fellow students systematically fieldwalked
each field . Finds were cleaned , sorted , 
weighed , counted and identified . This process
took two months . Patterns from the plots of
fieldwalked finds and cropmarks were then
compared . 
Content / discussion
The cropmarks could be described as either
enclosures or circles . Based on her reading
she hypothesised that they were land
boundaries of Iron Age or Romano-British
date . She anticipated that they would have
been the site of huts or barrows and expected
to find concentrations of artefacts from those
periods on the surface . 
The evidence proved inconclusive . Sufficient
material was recovered to argue for activity
in the Roman period but when plotted against
the cropmark features no direct correlation
could be established . The validity of the
exercise as a piece of research and fieldwork
is not prejudiced by the results . It provided a
local topic with both desktop and practical
aspects . 
structure which makes an ideal vehicle for
manageable research to identify , record , 
illustrate , compare and produce distribution
maps of is the dovecote . While there are some
classic examples of free-standing structures 
( how many visitors to Avebury have noticed
the circular dovecote belonging to Avebury
Manor just opposite the entrance to the
museum ?  )  , many are located in the end of
barns or stables . Another disappearing feature
are churn stands . Milk used to be collected
from farms in churns placed at the roadside by
farmers . They were put on stands so they could
be easily lifted across to the lorries . Many
stands still exist , though now redundant , and
can be found , often rather overgrown , in
hedgerows near to a farm ’ s access onto a road . 
Styles vary ( typology ) and different materials
were used . Very few are recorded .

Industrial archaeology : the Dudley ( No . 2 ) 
Canal from Selly Oak to Halesowen , 
Birmingham 
 ‘ Tom ’ attempted to evaluate the archaeological significance of the surviving surface
evidence for 8 km of a canal abandoned
nearly fifty years ago . The line of the canal
passed through a park and housing and
industrial estates . A significant feature was
the Lappal tunnel which had collapsed in
1917 . At nearly 4 km it was one of the
longest canal tunnels ever built .

Methodology
Tom began with maps to establish the line of
canal and accessibility . He planned to walk
the length of the earthwork , observing and
recording key features by note-taking , 
drawings ( including profiles ) and photography . 
He paid particular attention to bridges , 
wharves , overflows and tunnel spoil heaps , 
which had the appearance and the same
fieldwork requirements as barrows . 
Content / discussion
The first part of the line from the Worcester
and Birmingham canal was easily identified in
Selly Oak Park but the junction was
obliterated in 1953 so Tom used local oral
evidence and a dismantled towpath bridge to
establish its position . Landscape interpretation

The Defence of Britain
This area of archaeological research has been
given a boost recently by the Defence of
Britain project which is recording some of the
monuments slowly eroding away in the coastal
and inland landscape . About 450 airfields were
built during the Second World War particularly
in the east . Coastal defences survive in many
places simply because no one has bothered to
remove them , for example the concrete blocks
designed to slow a seaborne invasion at
Fairbourne , Gwynedd . Running in lines across
the countryside are numerous pillboxes
designed to hold up an invading army . These
could be studied for typology or distribution . 
In towns , metal was collected during the war to 
 ‘ help the war effort ’  . Careful examination of
the tops of garden walls reveals the extent of
such activity and provides fresh and original
archaeological evidence literally on the
doorstep .

Experimental archaeology
Planning , conducting and evaluating an
archaeological experiment or reconstruction 
can seem an attractive option . It can make a
worthwhile study but there are pitfalls to
avoid . In many cases it is an advantage if you
have some familiarity with the craft involved in
the experiment . Prehistoric flint knappers or

revealed where the line of the old canal
survived infilled between house gardens , which
had been laid out when it was still a
landscape feature . 
Photographic evidence showed tunnel portals
at the end of cuttings but like much of the
canal these cuttings had been infilled . 
Locating boggy ground in the current
landscape helped to reveal their original
locations . 
The tunnel had been constructed by digging
several shafts down to the proposed level of
the canal and then cutting a bore on either
side . The resulting spoil – red clay in this case
– was brought to the surface . Once the tunnel
had been cut and lined with brick the shafts
were back-filled , but the bulk of the excavated
material remained in heaps on the surface . 
Tom attempted to identify these 200-year-old
spoil heaps from remains in a housing estate
and adjacent Country Park by using an 1881
map . Erosion enabled him to determine the
constituent material of the mounds and even
retrieve reject bricks from the tunnel lining . 
Towards Halesowen the canal ran on a huge
earthwork embankment which was larger
than the bank and ditch system at Maiden
Castle . Tom was able to record profiles and
compare them with eighteenth-century
illustrations . 
Tom ’ s project included acknowledgements and
a bibliography reflecting the Birmingham
Canal Navigations and industrial archaeology . 
He produced plans , photographs and profiles
of features , and map extracts were placed in
an appendix . 
Romano-British potters had practice and
experience on their side when they were
making the artefacts we recover from
excavations . Therefore if you don ’ t have skills
in knapping or wheel-made ceramics , you
might be advised to avoid this type of project . 
Home-made hand-built pots , which do not
resemble any archaeological material ,  ‘ fired ’ in
a bonfire in the back garden do little to explain
or extend understanding of ceramics , their
manufacture or firing techniques . 
However , a student adept at woodworking
might reconstruct and fire a bow , testing draw

strength and range with different arrows and
arrowheads . The groove and splinter technique
of bone working for slender items such as pins
can be reproduced with animal bone from the
butcher and some sharp flint flakes . If you are
able to visit experimental centres such as the
Peat Moors Centre near Glastonbury you may
be able to get advice on opportunities for
developing these skills . 
WHERE TO GET HELP AND ADVICE
During the topic selection process you will
have identified an accessible range of resources . 
Where this involves the services of others , for
example museum staff or SMR personnel , any
request needs to be as clear and succinct as
possible . The best practice is to make it clear
that you have already done some background
research and focused on several questions to
which you feel your contact might be able to
offer answers . Don ’ t pick a topic and send it to
various possible sources of help expecting a
completed project by return ! Timing is also
crucial . While you need to do exploratory
work before making contact with requests for
assistance or publications , you cannot afford to
delay your approach for too long as agencies
have their priorities and ordering material from
them will involve a built-in time delay . 
National resources
Whatever project you select there will
inevitably be something of use on the Web . 
If nothing else , it can make access to sources 
of information faster . Start with one of the
archaeological gateway sites ( see p . 303 )  . 
Of particular use for projects in England is the
National Monuments Record ( NMR ) site . It is
comprehensive and self-explanatory . It offers 
a search service , which is free ‘ subject to
limitations ’  , and free information packs . Topics
available include ‘ Archaeology of England ’ and 
 ‘ Aerial photographs of England ’  . A valuable
link from NMR is to an alphabetical list of
SMR addresses . These are your local sources 
of detail on known sites and their staff offer
advice and printouts of information on their
database .

taken place at your site , visit the Excavation

Figure 12 . 7 This pill box at Kilnsea
dramatically illustrates the need for the
recording of Second World War monuments . 
Such examples can be combined to form the
basis of an archaeological study
calls ‘ archaeological interventions ’  , which
covers more than just excavations , and notes
where the record of that ‘ intervention ’ is
maintained . The result may send you back to
the NMR but at least it indicates archaeological
activity has occurred at your chosen site

EXAMPLE 5
Sites and settlement patterns before 1900
in an Oxfordshire parish 
 ‘ Marc ’ aimed to establish what continuity of
occupation / settlement could be discovered by
a survey of extant features and recorded
sites . His fieldwork centred on an earthwork
adjacent to Grims ’ Ditch , which had
apparently not been studied or recorded
previously . 
Sources
■ Oxfordshire SMR
■ Centre for Oxfordshire Studies
■ Texts on landscape archaeology and
fieldwork
■ 1841 Tithe map
■ Ordnance Survey maps 1877–1914
■ NMR in Swindon
Methodology
Marc used the SMR to create a comprehensive list of sites . He gained permission and
visited them all before deciding to focus on
two particular features for fieldwork survey . 
These were an earthwork and a surviving
ridge and furrow near the village . After
researching fieldwork techniques he recorded
these features . He was able to use
combinations of maps , documents , aerial
photographs and hedgerow dating to establish
the oldest boundaries in the area . 
Content / discussion
Marc ’ s summary of evidence was set against
the geology and topography of the parish . He
described a section of Grims ’ Ditch and other
earthworks and discussed their possible age . 
He found documentary evidence for a Norman
church but could find no physical evidence to
support this . Similarly , there was an
excavation report on an Anglo-Saxon
cemetery but no evidence for contemporary
settlement . He was able to use maps to
suggest the possible development of the parish
and suggest further possible study opportunities including excavation sites . 
In addition to acknowledgements and a
bibliography of landscape archaeology and
fieldwork techniques , Marc included profiles
and field plans , annotated maps and
photographs and a distribution map of sites . 
Larger map extracts were placed in an
appendix . 
book visits and be clear in advance about the
help you want . 

Units
Archaeological units are less easy to discover as
they are professional organisations in the
business of offering archaeological services to
those who need , and will pay for , them . 
Although their focus is not curation or
education their staff may assist if approached
sensibly . Local units can be found from the
link below or by typing ‘ archaeological units ’ 
into a search engine . 
www . dur . ac . uk / Archaeology / BritArch / 
Units . html
Libraries
Libraries vary hugely in the archaeology stock
they hold . Local libraries may hold local
collections including an archaeological journal
but are most used for background texts or the 
( rather slow ) inter-library loan service . 
University libraries ( where archaeology is
studied ) or national organisations such as the
NMR are the best option and will hold
excavation reports and journals . However , you
will need special permission to enter some
university libraries and they do not usually let
you borrow . It is worth persevering particularly with excavation reports , which are as
near as you may get to the evidence for some
sites . Some older reports may be difficult to
find . One last resort is to look for them at
second-hand archaeological booksellers 
( see p . 302 )  . 
PLANNING AND MANAGING TIME AND
WORD LIMITS
Your research will be guided by instructions
from your tutor or syllabus , which specify
presentational style , length and deadlines . You
must take note of these ‘ rules ’  . If the stipulated
length of a study is 3 , 500–4 , 000 words ( as at A
level ) you should plan to produce a study that
fits within these parameters . This may influence
your choice of title as examiners are looking
for depth of research and argument rather than
the superficial treatment of a large number of
sites or artefacts . Sometimes the required length
in thousands of words may seem daunting . If
you divide it up into sections and then
subdivide each again you will find you have a
framework on which to construct your study . 
A sensible model includes introduction , 
background information , research methods , 
research results , analysis and evaluation , and
conclusions . You need to ensure the emphasis
falls on your research and analysis rather than
providing masses of background scene-setting . 
Fight the tendency to put off starting ! Every
May , A Level projects are handed in with
letters enclosed as appendices revealing that
key information was still being sought only a
few weeks earlier . There are many sources of
information on time management and their
advice is equally applicable in the context of
archaeological coursework . The specific issues
for archaeology students revolve around the
frequent mix of indoor and outdoor activity
where planning and sequencing of work is
crucial . The ‘ desktop ’ research may involve
libraries , museums , the Sites and Monuments
Record and the National Monuments Record , 
all of which have their own time constraints . 
Outdoors you may be able to access your sites
at will but you may require permission and
have to work round the farmer ’ s calendar

( fieldwalking needs ploughed fields ) and the
weather . You need to plan and start early . 
Word processors have made preparing studies
much easier . You can collate information and
notes as you go along , integrate visual images
and perfect drafts more effectively . Try to
ensure that you also record all sources used so
that your references and bibliography are
complete . Incidentally , nobody will believe that
your hard disc crashed ( and you forgot to
make a back up ) the night you were printing
the final copy . That excuse sounds like ‘ my dog
ate it ’ to this generation of lecturers and
examiners . 
RECORDING EVIDENCE
How much of any site or range of artefacts you
record will depend on the nature of the investigation and to what extent the site in question is
central or more peripheral to the discussion . 
There is also the question as to the state of the
site when you come into contact with it . While
photographs and sketches will usually suffice
for GCSE , A Level and university projects will
require more detailed recording to support
your analysis and interpretation . Wass ( 1999 ) is
an excellent basic guide while Drewett ( 1999 ) 
provides a greater range of techniques . 
Your record is likely to comprise four major
types : drawn , written , photographic and
diagrammatic . Drawings include location maps , 
plans of features or buildings , profiles of
earthworks and elevations of structures . You
may be able to illustrate relationships or phases
through the medium of such illustrations . You
will certainly need to make notes so that you
can describe key features in your report . 
Assume that your reader has a sound archaeological understanding , but not necessarily
knowledge of your site , and address your work
to them on that basis . Photographs are useful
in illustrating things you have identified and
showing developments in the case of
excavations . Tables and diagrams should be
created where you have large amounts of data
such as with fieldwork projects . They are also
valuable for making comparisons and showing
processes . A quick library search of archaeological texts will provide a wealth of examples . 
Recording sites or features
Planning sites
You will probably wish to produce field
drawings of earthwork sites . While drawing
skills and surveying equipment obviously 
help , much can be achieved with simple gear : 
20 or 30 metre tapes , ranging poles , a compass
and marker arrows ( try tent pegs with 
coloured ribbon ) form a handy ‘ starter kit ’  . 
The simplest plans are likely to be made up
from measuring or pacing the main features
and roughly drawing hachures to indicate
slopes . 
For more accurate diagrams you will need to
lay down a grid over the features to be
recorded . A base line should be established and
then a second main grid line should be fixed at
right angles to the first . Parallel lines to each 
of these then form a total grid . It is advisable
to fix reference points so that you can return 
to the same grid , but you will need to do this
sensitively and with permission from a landowner . You cannot leave obtrusive markers on
public land or where grazing animals might
damage themselves . Ideally this grid should be
linked to reference points on OS maps . Once a
grid is established you can plot it onto graph
paper and by taking measurements from two
fixed points to the feature , plot it by the
process of triangulation .

When recording slopes , place marker arrows 
( one colour ) along the upper edge and others 
( a different colour ) at the lower extent of the
slope . This enables the lines of the feature to 
be plotted and the arrows can be reused . 
Conventional hachures , where the head of the
hachure represents the top of the slope and it
gets thinner as the slope goes down , should be
used . They indicate the direction and length of
the slope . Steepness is indicated by heavier
infill of the hachure , head shape or the
closeness of the hachures . 
Profiling features
If you want to draw a scale profile of an
earthwork you may need more equipment . 
However , there are some simple methods
which are effective . A horizontal line fixed
across the earthwork at 90 degrees to its main
alignment and kept level provides a baseline . 
Measurements are taken from it to the ground
at fixed intervals that will establish the profile
of your site . A series of shorter lengths may
make maintenance of a level easier and can
offer a solution for longer slopes as long as
adjustments are calculated accurately . Ensure
you record this . It is essential that you employ
the same scale for both horizontal and vertical
scales or your drawings will suffer from
distortion . If you have access to more
equipment , such as a level and measuring staff , 
your task will be quicker . Alternatively , your
geography department may have clinometers or
gradiometers which you could borrow and use

DOING AN ARCHAEOLOGICAL PROJECT ■ 279
Figure 12 . 8 A student drawing of the profile of earthworks at Crickley Hill including an example of the
use of hachures
to construct profiles in a series of angles and
lengths . 
If you follow the basic rules of setting out , 
measuring , plotting to scale and drawing up
your field results it is possible for enthusiastic
archaeology students to produce a decent
original plan . 
Recording excavations
Recording part of a current excavation site is
similar to what the real excavation team will be
doing . You need to consider how much detail
you require in terms of plans , sections and
photographs . You may need to ask about
evidence relating to the various phases of
occupation and to see particular finds , but it is
unlikely that the specialist reports will be ready
in time for you to see . A tape recorder might
be a useful aid for when you have the chance
to make enquiries . 
Recording buildings
Photography and sketches of the lower levels
and key external features are needed to
illustrate building materials and phases . If you
have internal access then room plans and details
of construction and decoration can be added . 
You are unlikely to be able to get precise
measurements for elevation drawings but using
tapes , clinometers and some basic trigonometry
can help produce a reasonable approximation . 
Recording artefacts
There are archaeological conventions for the
illustration of many finds and these can be
studied in archaeological reports . Producing
quality drawings is neither quick nor easy . You
should consider the extent of your artistic skills
and try them out against the recognised
formulae for archaeological illustration so that
you can judge your aptitude for this exercise . 
A reasonable alternative for those objects you
may have collected yourself in fieldwalking is
to scan them and trace the printout . 
Often when there is a quantity of pottery to
review attention is paid to what are called 
 ‘ diagnostic ’ sherds , for example rims and
decorated pieces . The less significant sherds can
then be grouped and described as collections . 
Such sherds may be counted and weighed and
the information about them given in tabular
form rather than by illustration . 
Smaller objects like bronze brooches or flint
tools require careful treatment by the
illustrator and will always need to be drawn
280 ■ ARCHAEOLOGY COURSEBOOK
Figure 12 . 9 A scan of an artefact recovered by
fieldwork
from at least two perspectives – front-on and
side-on – to give a clear indication of their
design . Sometimes in the case of objects , for
example flint axes , it is the profile shape that is
relevant in the report rather than a detailed
drawing showing the flaking process . Each
artefact should be drawn to a scale , shown in
the drawing . Some description needs to be
written to make clear to the reader matters
relating to the object that the drawing does not
necessarily convey , for example colour or
texture . 
A range of details should be used when
cataloguing objects ( see p . 267 )  . These will
include provenance , dimensions and description
of key features . 
WRITING UP
There are two considerations here : what does
the reader of your study really need to know
about your site ? How can you best present the
evidence ? Assume that your reader has a sound
archaeological understanding , but not
necessarily knowledge of your site , and address
your work to them on that basis . 
Refer again to the assignment brief . There may
be specific advice on structure and presentation . This may include instructions , title
pages , abstracts and appendices . It will
probably mention plagiarism and referencing . 
Plagiarism
This means using other people ’ s work
unchanged or without acknowledgement . 
Avoid it at all costs . It is particularly easy to
slip into accidently where you are heavily
reliant on one guidebook or report , or where
you download material as notes from the
internet . Be on your guard and if necessary
adjust your question to avoid repeating
somebody else ’ s enquiry . 
Presentation
Your original plan , probably somewhat adapted
in the light of research , will form the basis for
the work you submit . You will have sifted and

Figure 12 . 11 Bar and pie charts are ideal for
displaying the results of fieldwalking
sorted a range of materials and evidence and
need a clear idea of the layout and balance of
your work before you start writing . A flow
diagram is useful . 
Your illustrations should add to and explain
points raised in your commentary . Avoid the
temptation to put your photographs in just
because you paid for them ! Illustrations are
probably best within or close to the text that
refers to them . The ability to use a scanner is
useful here . Always ensure that there is some
annotation of any illustration . Transparent
overlays are useful for illustrating distribution
and your interpretation of phases . Maps can be
traced as the base for these . 
282 ■ ARCHAEOLOGY COURSEBOOK
KEY SKILL
Referencing
Referencing is an important part of a quality
study and is insisted on at degree level . Get
into the habit not only of listing your sources , 
both books and journals , but also of putting
the page references into your draft notes as
you select interesting comments or
information . There are several referencing
systems but the Harvard ( author–date ) 
version is becoming standard . Wherever you
write something which is based on another ’ s
work you should reference that original work
in a bracket immediately after your
statement , giving the author ’ s surname and
the date of publication . In the bibliography
you should list all your sources alphabetically
by author . You also include date of
publication , title , publisher and place of
publication as shown below . 
An example from case study X :  
 ‘ The discovery of eight flint axes from Creteway
Down at Folkestone can be associated with
finds of Neolithic date from the same area .  
( Clarke 1982 )  ’  . 
The study ’ s bibliography contained the
following entry : 
Clarke , A . F .  ( 1982 ) The Neolithic of Kent – A
Review . Archaeology in Kent to AD 1500 , CBA
Research Report No 48 , pp . 25–30 . 
There are some variations on the Harvard
system in use in different universities , so
check with your supervisors exactly which
format they want . At A level , the version
above is acceptable . 
Websites must also be referenced . No
standard has yet emerged . You should list full
web addresses and what they are in the
bibliography . You could number them and use 
( web1 ) etc . in the body of the text although
some universities may want the full address in
the text . 
The key to successful revision is to be
proactive . Start early and take charge , don ’ t
wait until the last moment . However , it is also
possible to spend a long time revising ineffectively . You need to focus from the start on
what you actually need to do and to revise
actively . The key is to ensure that you
understand your subject and can communicate
that understanding in the format required by
the examiners . 
CATALOGUING YOUR PORTFOLIO
Ideally you will have been cataloguing and
cross-referencing your notes as you went
through your course . If you are like 90 per
cent of other students you won ’ t have even
thought about this . This should therefore be
your first task . 
■ Start by putting your notes into an order . 
You may have a course content list
supplied . If not , then you could organise
your notes chronologically or by theme . 
The key is to get them organised . 
■ Now see what you have got . One way of
doing this is to write out lists or grids . The
latter are preferable because they will enable
you to make connections and use the same
material in several ways . 
■ Compare your lists with course or syllabus
details . Are there gaps ? If there are then
your next task will be to copy up notes
from a friend or make some from a key
text . 
■ Cross-reference your notes . You may be
examined on methods , sources or topics so
you need to have flexibility about how you
use material . There are several ways of

doing this such as colour coding , using
Post-its or producing grids . A particularly
useful way is to use index cards . 
Reducing information onto cards
Many student find index cards useful for
learning and condensing essential knowledge
and to help them apply their understanding . To
produce good cards you have to decide what is
the essence of each topic , case or method you
need to learn . This is a useful discipline in itself
as it forces you to consider relevance to exam
questions and to be selective . How much you
write on each card will depend on your
confidence in your ability to remember . Some
students go through a process of reducing
notes in this way several times until they are
left with keywords or phrases . This process in
itself helps with revision of knowledge . Because

Figure 13 . 3 Examples of revision cards . The process of selection involved in making these will help you
remember the detail
you have had to process the information it
lodges in your memory much better than if
you had just read or underlined notes . The
words or phrases themselves will work as
prompts and suggest additional material to you . 
REVISION ACTIVITIES
Mix and match
This is one of several ways in which you can
use the cards you have just made . It can be
done individually or turned into a game with
other students . Divide case study cards and
themes or aspects of themes into two separate
piles . Turn over one card from each pile and
then try to make a connection , for example
Boxgrove and Technology . This can be done
with both sites and methods . 
Make up mnemonics
Mnemonics are usually made by taking a
number of linked words and then trying to
make a new word from the first letter of each , 
for example Trench , Area and Box makes ‘ Tab ’  . 
This can work as a prompt when you need to
remember a list of detailed points . It is
probably best for methods or ‘ what can be
learned from .  .  .  ?  ’ type questions . Use it
sparingly . There is a limit to the number you
will recall and exams are increasingly about
applying understanding rather than
remembering lists . 
Mindmaps
A creative way to remember connections is to
create a visual map of a subject in our minds . 
This works on the principle that we remember
key images better than keywords . Start by
placing a major concept , theme , site or method
on a page . Identify four or five main aspects
you wish to learn and mark them in bold on
lines radiating out from the original word . 
Next draw something which each word
suggests to you at the other end of the line . 
The more personal your choice of image , the
more likely you are to remember .  ( It doesn ’ t
have to be sensible .  ) From here other
connections can radiate out much like a spider
diagram . cSee examples on pp . 182 and 237 . 
Visual reminders
For archaeological methods , visual cues can be
useful in revising and checking your understanding . One method is to produce your own
sketches such as the examples in Figure 13 . 4 . 
Playing games
Many students find that games help them to
remember and also encourage them to make
links between areas of knowledge . They also
break up the revision process . Many popular
games can be adapted . These are just two you
could try . 
Archaeological dominos . 
Two archaeological words are put on each
domino ( card )  . Deal them out and play in the
normal way with the following addition . Each
time a player lays down a domino they have to
make a connection between the two words . 
Blockbusters . 
If you draw a hexagonal grid on a piece of
acetate ( OHT ) the task of setting up this game
becomes straightforward . The question setter
inserts a letter into each hexagon and teams
compete to make lines across the ‘ board ’  , as in
the popular television programme . All the clues
should come from the syllabus .

TACKLING EXAM PAPERS
Ideally you should have become thoroughly
familiar with the format and type of questions
used in the exam during your course . Examiners do not try to catch students out and are
highly unlikely to change their types of question without warning . The specific questions
and any sources used are likely to be new to
you but their format and what you are asked to
do will be largely familiar . You need to work
out what each paper or section wants you to
do . To do this you need to look at the command words and the type of markscheme used . 
Command words
The way your essays are organised will reflect
the command words in the question . For
example , for the question ,  ‘ Compare the evidence
for complex settlement from two areas that you
have studied ’ the command words provide you
with a ready-made structure : 
Mark schemes
Mark schemes are increasingly published , so
there is little excuse for not looking at them . 
Short questions which ask you to explain or
describe usually reward you with one mark for
each point drawn from a source that is linked
to the question or for each occasion where you
deploy your own knowledge in a relevant way . 
Most questions worth more than a couple of
marks and essays are usually marked to ‘ levels
of response ’ markschemes where the levels are
defined by set criteria . If there are five levels in
a 25-mark essay you will not score high marks
unless you write to suit the criteria for levels 4
and 5 . Shorter structured questions are typical
of schemes of assessment for AS level and
larger structured questions and essays for A2 . 
Both use levels . The examples of ‘ levels ’ 
markschemes in the Appendix ( p . 305 ) provide
the answers to the exercises on pp . 24 and 57 . 
The lower levels are usually for responses that
include some relevant material , but do little
with it , or a comment with little or no support . 
Looking at markschemes and doing practice
assignments are obviously essential and you
will do this as part of your course . One way of
helping yourself is to play the role of examiner . 
Try setting questions in the style of the exam . 
Produce a markscheme , write responses and
then mark your work . An alternative is to swap
questions with a friend . Either way , by putting
yourself into this role you will gain insights
into what you need to do . 
288 ■ ARCHAEOLOGY COURSEBOOK
Introduction : define keywords ( complex
settlement )  . Identify the two areas and say
why you have selected them . 
Conclusion : to what extent are there general
patterns ? 
Discussion tries to identify common ground
and major differences by reference to clearly
established criteria such as size , specialisation , planning , etc . Aim for breadth in
consideration of similarities and differences . 
Consider strengths and weaknesses in the
evidence base for each region .

KEY SKILL
Understanding command words
All questions contain words or phrases which let you know what the examiner expects of you . It is
important that you become familiar with the words and phrases used by archaeology examiners . 
The list below is roughly ranked in order of difficulty . Words in the top half of the list are usually
used only for short or structured questions . Those in the lower half are also used for essays . The
marks allocated will provide you with further clues . For example , for two marks the examiners
will want a couple of words or sentences , for ten marks at least a paragraph .

Examination essays
The advice on pp . 190–1 is as relevant to the
examination as it is to essays written outside
the examination . For essays in any subject the
same essential rules apply : 
■ Accurate factual statements
■ well linked to the question
■ supported by detailed and relevant case
study data
■ lead to success . 
The examples shown in Figure 13 . 5 are drawn
from A level and undergraduate levels
markschemes for essays . 
In the exam
Most of you will have taken many exams
already . As always the same golden rules apply . 
In addition , don ’ t forget your ruler and
magnifying glass ! 
Take a watch in and use it . Divide the number
of marks into the time available . Allocate time
per question and try to stick to it . 
Use your time effectively . Read the question
paper before you start . Where you have a
choice , make sure that you have understood all
the questions before you make your choice . 
Often the longest questions , particularly those
with quotations , look harder than they actually
are . Try to avoid doing a question just because
it contains a keyword you know about , you
need to address the whole question . 
On essay papers rough out a number of plans
at once and add points later in case you forget
them . They can save you time but don ’ t spend
too long doing this at the expense of the actual
essay . 
If you finish early there is bound to be
something you can improve on . Examiners are
looking for : 
■ Breadth : have you considered all the ideas
which might be appropriate to the
question ? 
■ Relevance : have you linked all your 
points to the command words in the
question ? 
■ Support : have you produced enough
detailed specific evidence to illustrate the
points you have made ? 
And finally .  .  . 
You may have a battery of fluffy toys ready to
bring you luck in the exam but sound
preparation is a surer way to success . If you
have absorbed the lessons in this book you
should be able to cope with whatever you are
asked . Don ’ t forget that all examination essays
will have flaws . No examiner expects perfection
and if you have worked throughout your
course you should succeed . The following
examples give you an idea of the standard at 
A Level . 
EXAMPLES OF MARKED RESPONSES TO
EXAM QUESTIONS
These two essays were produced by students
who attempted NEAB 1997 A Level Paper 2
under exam conditions . They illustrate
common strengths and weaknesses and
illustrate the difference between a weak and 
a reasonably strong answer . In reading 
them , bear in mind that the students were
under pressure and had to write four essays 
in 3 hours . The examiner ’ s comments are
italicised .

PREPARING FOR YOUR ARCHAEOLOGY EXAMINATION ■ 291
What is the evidence for the organisation
of production for one type of artefact ? 
This is a ‘ list type ’ essay . The question offers the
opportunity to bring in all the methods and
sources used by archaeologists in investigating
one type of artefact you are familiar with from
your course of study . Note the word ‘ one ’  . 
Detailed knowledge will be required to do well
and a high level answer would compare
evidence for different aspects of production . 
Pottery has been used to date and research past
societies . It provides evidence of social
development with specialisation by art and
decoration . It is often found in burials which
provides clues to its function . 
This is not a good start .  ‘ Axel ’ has not really
addressed the question and has interpreted
artefact as a type of material , which is not
specific enough . It would have been better if he
had selected Neolithic bowls or Samian
tableware . 
Through analysis of the inclusions in the clay , 
petrology can show the origin of the natural
resources and suggest the location of pottery
production . 
This would be relevant to any ceramic material . 
A specific example should have been included . 
Pottery was first produced in the Neolithic
around 4000 BC . Early pottery was very heavy
and coarse with round bottoms for example
Grimston ware . Its basic shape was probably
because there would have been no flat surfaces
or tables so the rounded bottom would have
prevented tipping on an uneven earth .  
[ Diagram ] 
Excavations at windmill hill produced finds of
Gabroic ware , which had lugs for holding or
suspension . Inclusions included basalt which
could be sourced to the lizard area of
Cornwall . This suggests trade and distribution
in the Neolithic . Windmill hill pottery was
another tradition of pottery making . 
Axel has produced two relevant examples here
and linked them to a method and hinted at
how distribution might be studied . His diagram 
( not included here ) also had some relevance . 
Hearths and deposits of fired clay provides
evidence of pottery production . Because it is so
durable large quantities are often found on
archaeological sites . Even though it is ususally
damage , archaeologists can learn a lot from it . 
Improvements in technology were accompanied
by improved style and methods of decoration . 
The southern tradition of Peterborough wares
included carination . It has been suggested that
pots were not just functional items but also
decorative . String was knotted and used to
decorate pottery . This was called maggotting . 
Quills or reeds were also used to pierce and
inscribe pottery . They may have been used as
high prestige items to show a persons status or
given as gifts in alliance making . 
Much of this is relevant but it is not well
focused . Axel should have discussed how
archaeologists know how the pots were
decorated . He is starting to narrate the
development of pottery rather than address the
question . 
Black burnished ware is distinct and easily
recognisable . It was produced in the Poole
Harbour area of Dorset . Iron age settlements in
Hamworthy have evidence of kiln sites and 
292 ■ ARCHAEOLOGY COURSEBOOK
also at the Roman site at Lake Gales in
Wimborne . 
Again this is descriptive . It would have been
better to discuss what can be learnt about
production levels in those settlements . 
Pottery continued to be produced and
developed as a status item . Samian ware was
decorated with a lion ’ s head . It was very fine
and produced for decorative use and for people
to demonstrate their status . Beaker ware was
also very fine . It is usually found often in
burial sites which suggests it had a very specific
purpose . Beaker ware may have been brought
be immigrants or the idea imported from
Europe . By the late Bronze Age British 
 ‘ Beaker ’ pottery was produced . Both types
being identified by thin section analysis of the
original material and its inclusions . 
This is largely descriptive and not made
relevant . It could have been used earlier to
illustrate petrology . It is not a conclusion . 
Overall , Axel has provided some material that
is relevant to the question , and some limited
examples . There is an attempt to organise the
material into paragraphs , but it is not sustained . 
There is no direction to the essay aside from a
loose chronological order . There are also some
inaccuracies . While a specific artefact was not
identified , much of the material could have
been used . However , there was insufficient focus
on methods . It is a high level 2 answer and
scored a borderline 10 / 25 .  
 ‘ A sedentary way of life is necessary for
storage practices ’ Discuss . 
This is a discursive type essay on a settlement
and economic topic . It is more demanding
conceptually than the previous question and so
a lesser depth of knowledge might be required . 
It also requires you to reach a judgement in
response to the statement in the question . It
offers the opportunity to draw on examples
across your course . 
There is great variation in both storage
methods and the substances which are stored . 
Food , wealth and other resources can all be
stored to extend their availability and thus help
in time of hardship or shortage . Storage is also
an economic strategy . A sedentary way of life
in fact makes storage practices necessary
because people can no longer follow the
seasons and forage for wild foods . 
Even in the Palaeolithic and Mesolithic periods
when a mobile , hunter-gatherer society is
generally regarded as having existed there is
evidence of storage . At the cave at Pontnewydd
in Gwynedd animal bones have been
discovered in recesses contemporary with
occupation layers which suggests the cave had
been used to deposit animal ‘ joints ’  .  
 ‘ Zia ’ has not begun her response by defining the
terms but it is clear that she has understood
them . She has confidently provided an example
that challenges the statement in the question . 
Star Carr , which was excavated by Graham
Clarke in 1949 , was dated to the Mesolithic
around 7000 BC . Like a number of other sites it
seems to have been used as a seasonal base
during the winter months . People seem to have
used locations on estuaries , rivers and the
coasts . At some there is evidence of tree
clearing to provide grazing for red deer and to
make hunting easier . This manipulation Of
nature suggests a move towards storage . These
mobile groups could not take much with them
as they moved . Their choice of tools , personal
jewellery , their dogs and possibly tent frames
represents a storing of potentially useful

material or curation . They may have used
perishable forms of storage such as wicker or
birch bark containers to carry or store thins
such as honeycomb . 
Not all relevant . More could have been made
of the nature of evidence for this type of storage
and whether absence of evidence means
absence . 
Palaeolithic people may have benefited from
natural storage of mammoths in glaciers but the
first type of storage the used was probably
smoking . Stakeholes on some sites have been
interpreted and drying or smoking racks . Salt
may have also been used , but the early hard
evidence usually comes from settled
communities . Briquetage found in the Iron Age
provides evidence of widespread use . 
Zia is making up for a lack of specific
knowledge with some generalised examples
here . They are all relevant . 
At Danbury and other hill forts from the Iron
Age storage is seen in the large pits and the 
 ‘ four poster ’ structures . Pits up to 20 feet deep
and 7 feet across were dug down into the
bedrock . Apparently they were used for grain
although ritual purposes have also been
suggested . Some pits provided enough grain to
keep a large population fed for a year . In the
pits the outer layers of grain decay giving off
carbon dioxide which preserves the remaining
grain by inhibiting bacteria .  ‘ Four posters ’ are
identified by four postholes in a square pattern . 
They are generally interpreted as granaries but
may have had some other use such as chicken
coops . This storage was only appropriate
because of the agricultural surplus produced by
large numbers of sedentary farmers . It provided
them with insurance against the vagaries of the
weather meant that time spent in travelling
from one site to another could be used in
production of foodstuffs . 
A very relevant example with some depth of
knowledge . There is a clear attempt to relate it
to the question although not all the paragraph
is relevant or accurate . She will not be penalised
for this , but she has wasted a little time in
writing it . 
Earliest agricultural people in the early
Neolithic also began to ‘ store ’ their dead .  ‘ The
mixed up remains in tombs and long barrows
represent a form of macabre storage . Again this
is linked to sedentism . A further type of
storage is evident in individual burials during
the Bronze Age . Personal ornamentation was a
reflection of wealth and being kept on the
person meant it could be safeguarded . People
in earlier mobile societies did not seem to
accumulate such wealth . 
Zia raises two good points here . While she could
be criticised for not knowing about alternative
theories and evidence she will not be penalised . 
Many centres lack recent texts and this would
not be fair . She is thinking laterally about
storage and would gain credit even though
points are underdeveloped . 
Today coinage is the most recognisable form of
storage of wealth . Coins appeared late in
prehistory and like jewellery are easily
transportable and concealed . They are not an
encumbrance to mobility in the same way that
herds of cattle might be . 
This relevant , general point represents a lost
opportunity . She could have discussed social
storage and the contradictory idea of very
mobile forms of storage developed in sedentary
societies . 
294 ■ ARCHAEOLOGY COURSEBOOK
Mobile populations require small-scale storage
of light and easily transportable products . 
Larger scale storage of bulky items are more
appropriate to sedentary populations .  
 ‘ Sedentary ’ and ‘ storage ’ are usually linked
because if a group stores a high percentage of
the wealth or resources in one place and then
leaves them unattended for long periods the
stored items are very likely to be exploited or
damaged by other third parties be they animals
or human . If you store a great deal you need to
be sedentary . 
The conclusion addressed the question and
attempted to reach a judgement , which qualifies
the initial statement . 
Virtually all the essay was relevant , analytical
and well focused . Zia demonstrated the ability
to think widely about the concepts involved 
and structured her paragraphs in a logical way . 
She was low on examples and some sections
were flawed , but there was still enough here 
to reach the bottom of band 4 and a mark 
of 16 / 25 .

BELOW UNIVERSITY LEVEL
There are plenty of opportunities to study
archaeology although the range of qualifications is relatively small . To get further
information on any of them either contact your
local institution or the Council for British
Archaeology ( CBA ) Education service .  
/ educate / ed1 . html
Short courses are offered by Colleges of
Further Education ( FE ) and the Workers
Educational Association ( WEA )  . Typically
these will be 2 hours a week for ten weeks and
are generally aimed at adults . Increasingly , 
colleges will offer an Open College Network 
( OCN ) certificate for these courses . 
Day schools or conferences are offered by
university departments , FE colleges , local and
national archaeological organisations and
museums . Many of these involve lectures at
university level although some are practically
based . The two key sources on these are
Current Archaeology ( CA ) and British
Archaeology ( BA ) magazines . 
Field schools , or training digs , are offered by
universities and some local organisations in the
summer . Details are advertised in CA and BA
magazines . 
GCSE Archaeology
This is offered by AQA . 
www . aqa . org . uk / 
Students study archaeological methods and one
period of British archaeology from prehistory
to post-medieval . There is an exam on each
section which follows a standard format . Paper
1 involves interpretation of a map and aerial
photograph followed by a series of short
questions on a range of methods . Paper 2 has 
a choice of several illustrations of sites or
artefacts , each with a number of short questions . There is also a short piece of coursework . GCSE is largely offered by FE colleges
and a few schools . 
AS and A Level Archaeology
These are also offered by AQA . The AS can 
be taken separately or as the first stage of an 
A Level . Each exam is broken down into three
sections or modules . Five of these sections are
examinations which each last between one and
one and a half hours .

AS Level ( first half of A Level ) 
AS level examinations consist of short
questions focused on a series of sources . For
AS1 and 2 you will have to interpret the
sources , for AS3 the sources are largely there as
a stimulus . 
A2 ( second half of A Level ) 
A4 and A5 each have a stimulus-based question
and a choice of essays . They can be approached
through the study of any period . 
AS and A Level are offered in some FE
colleges and schools . To find your nearest
centre , contact the AQA or CBA . 
There are also some elements of archaeology in
the Classical Civilisation A Level offered by
OCR and in the Advanced Vocational Level
Travel and Tourism Course . 
Access to higher education
These are general courses aimed at adults
returning to education and offered in FE
colleges . A few of these offer archaeology as an
option in their courses . 
AT UNIVERSITY
Most courses are offered at degree level
although there has been an increase in the
number of sub-degree programmes on offer
such as HNC and HND . Some of these are
focused on practical archaeology . While degrees
almost always involve study at university , some
universities , notably Bournemouth , have
franchised sub-degree programmes to FE
colleges . 
At degree level there is considerable variety . 
You can study archaeology as a BA or a BSc , 
or in Scotland for four years for an MA . 
Detailed information can be obtained from the
CBA or from the 45 institutions offering
elements of archaeology in various degrees . 
Archaeology can be studied on its own , in
combination or as part of other subjects . The
information here largely applies to where it can
be studied as a single subject . All courses will
include elements on the development of
archaeology , its methods and techniques , as
well as the theory used to make sense of
archaeological evidence . Beyond that they will
vary considerably in their choice of topics .

In considering university courses you may
want to give thought to the following : 
■ Is the course thematic or period based ? 
■ Which periods can I study ? 
■ Does the assessment pattern suit me ? Is it
continuous assessment or final exam based ? 
■ What is the department strong in ( for
example science at Bradford , prehistory at
Sheffield )  ? 
■ Does it have a practical or heritage element 
( for example Bournemouth )  ? 
■ What kinds of placements and excavation
opportunities are on offer ? 
■ How is it rated ? 
■ Am I likely to get the qualifications to get
an offer ? 
■ Do I need previous experience ?  
( You should try and get some practical
experience ) 
Market forces
Some courses have more applicants than others . 
They normally deal with this by asking higher
grades from prospective students . If you are a
standard A level student you simply have to
get the grades . If you have any other
educational background it is worth contacting
the department directly for advice before
making your application . Many are particularly
keen on mature students , even if they haven ’ t
got A levels . 
League tables
Universities are ranked on research and
teaching . A good research record may tell you
that the university has published good research
or that it has a lot of researchers . You may not
actually be taught by the key researchers . 
There also appears to be a bias towards larger
departments in the way the tables are
calculated . Bournemouth University in
particular seems to have suffered in this respect
despite producing important national research
such as the MARS report . Teaching tables may
reflect the quality of lecturing . One has to be a
little careful interpreting these . Unlike GCSE
and A Level there is no systematic comparison
of the quality of degrees from different universities . A 2 : 1 from one institution may or may
not be as good as a 2 : 1 from another . 
Figure 14 . 2 summarises recent government
assessments and information on A Level grades
asked for . It also lists some of the specialisms
298 ■ ARCHAEOLOGY COURSEBOOK
Figure 14 . 1 Although it is sometimes difficult
to arrange , you should try to get some practical
experience of archaeology prior to applying or
going to university
on offer but is not intended to be comprehensive . With over 100 different possibilities
for joint or part honours courses in
archaeology , there are many other opportunities to study archaeology in other university
departments . Examples include Pre-Columbian
Art and Architecture at Essex , Maritime
Studies at St Andrews or Wetland Archaeology
at Hull . 
STEPPING UP TO DEGREE LEVEL
If you have studied A Level Archaeology , you
may find that there is not much of an initial
step up . You may even find that you have less
to do at first . As with most subjects there is
considerable overlap between A Levels and
many first year undergraduate programmes . It
is worth considering this in your choice of
programme . It may be a good idea to select
new topics or periods from those you did at A
Level to broaden your knowledge and maintain
your interest . If you have chosen a course with
a practical scientific or statistical element you
may find this new . Although you will generally
get support at the university , these are areas
you should prepare for if you haven ’ t done
them for a while .

Figure 14 . 2 League tables based on the most recent survey of research by the Higher Education
Funding Council . However , as an undergraduate , you will principally want good teaching . It is possible
for an institution to be better at teaching than research and vice versa
University lecturers and undergraduates have
identified the following areas as different from
A Level or where students sometimes struggle : 
■ Working more independently or in groups
■ Making oral presentations ( including
papers ) in an interesting way
■ Coping with theoretical concepts
■ Adjusting to the idea that knowledge is
always the product of interpretation
■ Coping with maths and science elements
■ Coping with wide chronological and
geographical ranges
■ Adjusting to the precision required in
excavation
■ Using academic libraries , journals and texts
■ Writing essays in an academic style ( see 
pp . 190–1 ) 
■ Using academic referencing from books , 
journals and web pages in assignments 
( see p . 282 ) 
300 ■ ARCHAEOLOGY COURSEBOOK
There are so many excellent sites , museums and
written and electronic resources available to
archaeology students that we can only list a
fraction of those available . Since selection has
to be subjective we have included those
resources that we have found most useful and
which our students have made most use of . 
Although we have tried to provide a good
range within it , our choice is clearly biased
towards our own interests . Another person ’ s
list would undoubtedly look very different . 
Other sources , which provide additional depth
on topics contained in the text , are listed in the
bibliography .

JOURNALS
In most subjects you would be unlikely to look
at journals before university level . However , in
archaeology it should be different . The first in
this list are all very accessible and are often
beautifully illustrated . The remainder are useful
sources of case studies . Many good case studies
only appear in journals .
