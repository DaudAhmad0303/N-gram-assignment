An ancient carved statue of a very full-figured woman , known as the Venus of Willendorf , originated far from where it was found in the early 20th century , in Willendorf , Austria . Scientists recently peered inside the voluptuous Ice Age figure for the first time since its discovery and found clues that helped them trace the origins of the stone to a location hundreds of miles away , in northern Italy . 

The statue , which measures just 4 . 3 inches ( 11 centimeters ) tall , dates to about 30 , 000 years ago during the Paleolithic period ( 2 . 6 million to 10 , 000 years ago )  . An Ice Age artisan would have carved the figure with flint tools , and researchers with the Natural History Museum of Vienna ( NMW ) excavated the ochre-painted carving from a bank on the Danube River on Aug . 7 , 1908 , according to the museum ' s website . 
Though small , the Venus statue is highly detailed , representing " a symbolized adult and faceless female with exaggerated genitalia , pronounced haunches , a protruding belly , heavy breasts , and a sophisticated headdress or hairdo ,  " researchers wrote in a new study , published Feb . 28 in the journal Scientific Reports . In fact , archaeologists who discovered the statue named it after a deity of love , because at the time they presumed that ancient female statues with prominent sexual features were surely fertility goddesses .

It was the statuette ' s raw material rather than its representational detail that intrigued the scientists . It was carved from oolitic limestone , a type of sedimentary rock made of spherical grains cemented together , according to the Kansas Geological Survey . However , there are no oolitic limestone deposits for at least 124 miles ( 200 kilometers ) around Willendorf , according to the study . 

Pictures derived from micro-computed tomography scans of the Venus figure show an embedded bivalve and limonite ( iron ore ) concretions .

As one of the oldest examples of figurative sculpture , the Venus figure is considered too rare and valuable to risk investigating it with invasive methods . But micro-computed X-ray tomography ( CT ) scans offered scientists a chance to noninvasively examine sediments and particles inside the statue . They looked at the clumps of ooid spheres in the limestone , comparing them with clusters from similar oolitic limestone deposits that were sampled from locations across Europe : from France to the Ukraine and Crimea in the east , and from Germany to as far south as Sicily . Limestone samples from Saga de Ala , a site in northern Italy ' s Lake Garda valley , were " virtually indistinguishable " from the Venus limestone , suggesting " a very high probability for the raw material to come from south of the Alps ,  " the scientists wrote in the study . 

Their scans also showed that Venus ' rocky interior contained fragments of tiny bivalve fossils , which the scientists identified as belonging to the genus Oxytomidae . That placed the age of the stone between 251 million and 66 million years old , when that now-extinct genus was alive . Oolite limestone from northern Italy likewise held bivalve fragments , the researchers reported .
