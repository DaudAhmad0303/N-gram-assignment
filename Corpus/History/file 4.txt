( CNN ) The Black Sea gave up a few more of its secrets when storms whipped the coast of Amasra , northern Turkey , last month . 

A number of Roman ruins dating from the first to third century AD washed ashore , the latest remnants to emerge of the ancient Anatolian city of Amastris . 
The objects were found by locals walking the shoreline who noticed carved marble and other masonry among the rocks . The marble remnants are indicative of a period of construction during the reign of Roman emperor Septimius Severus ( 193-211 AD ) says Baran Aydin , director of the Amasra Museum .

Severus , a military leader who took control in the bloody Year of the Five Emperors , oversaw the Roman Empire when it controlled approximately half the coastline of the Black Sea . Amastris significantly predates his rule . The city , 184 miles east of Istanbul , was founded by Persian princess Amastrine in the early fourth century BC and passed between Roman , Byzantine , Genoese and Ottoman control in the last two millennia .  
 " We know from old travelers ' reports there were some very spectacular temples in Amastris ,  " Aydin says . It ' s possible , he adds , that parts of the find came from these Roman temples . 
Roman ruins retrieved from the shoreline of Amasra , where the ancient city on Amastris once stood .

How the ruins ended up in the sea is more of a mystery . Speculation is rife that objects could have been discarded at sea many years ago by construction workers .  
 " I guess those fragments were dumped in history ,  " says Aydin , adding such an occurrence is not unusual for Amasra .  " In those times people didn ' t know the meaning of these ruins .  " 
There ' s a certain poetry to their fate : according to Ancient Greek writer Memnon of Heraclea , Amastrine was drowned at sea at the hands of her two sons .

Archaeologists have found the Black Sea , east of the Mediterranean , a source of perennial curiosity . Its waters below 500 feet contain no oxygen , aiding preservation , and some estimate hundreds , maybe thousands of shipwrecks lie on the seabed in remarkable condition . 
While organizations like the Black Sea Maritime Archaeology Project are investing in costly dive missions to view wrecks in situ , Aydin has fragments of history washing up at his feet .  
 " Every year it happens ,  " says the museum director , talking down his good fortune .  " We are living on an ancient city and there are many , many ruins underneath .  " 
Approximately ten artifacts were found dating from the 1st to 3rd century AD . 
Approximately ten artifacts were found dating from the 1st to 3rd century AD . 
The next step is to further assess the find . Approximately 10 artifacts were retrieved , says Aydin , and experts are poring over them before enrolling museum-worthy items into their inventory .  
 " I ' m very careful about such ruins ,  " the director adds ,  " they are valuable for us because of their cultural meaning .  " 
Careful as the museum may be , the ruins have already survived what Aydin says locals are calling the worst storm in 40 years . For Amasra at least , there was a silver lining .
