Story highlights
World ' s oldest figurative tattoos discovered
They include animals thought to represent status and power 
( CNN ) The world ' s oldest figurative tattogos have been discovered on two 5 , 000-year-old mummies from Egypt . 

Tattoos depicting a wild bull and a Barbary sheep were found on the upper arm of a male mummy , while the shoulder and upper arm of a female mummy bore " S " shaped motifs . 
The find , details of which are published in the Journal of Archaeological Science , pushes back evidence for the tattooing in Africa by 1 , 000 years , and it overturns the belief that only women were tattooed in Predynastic Egypt -- the era before the country ' s unification by the first pharaoh at around 3100 BCE .  
 " The symbols being tattooed are quite extraordinary ,  " Daniel Antoine , one of the lead researchers in the project and British Museum ' s curator of physical anthropology , tells CNN . 
A sign of status , magical power or just art ? 
Antoine says that the animals on the man , especially the bull , are likely to be associated with status , power and virility . Both horned animals are frequently depicted in Predynastic Egyptian art . Similarly , the S-motifs that run vertically over the woman ' s right shoulder were also used in pottery decoration at the time . 
Antoine points out that the mummies -- who , according to radiocarbon dating , lived between 3351 and 3017 BC -- were from the period before Egyptian hieroglyphs came into use . This makes it harder to determine the meanings behind the symbols , as all they have to go on is parallels with imagery found elsewhere .

He speculates that the tattoos probably symbolized a combination of things :  " referencing status , maybe bravery in the case of the animals , but also maybe something more complex , like cult or magical knowledge or protection .  "  
 " They were very sophisticated people 5 , 000 years ago ,  " he says .  " There ' s no reason why their reasoning for having a tattoo on their body wouldn ' t be as multifaceted as it is today .  " 
Ancient tattoo artists
The research suggests that the tattooing process would have been similar to that today : using a needle to insert a carbon-based element -- probably soot -- under the skin .  " They were very fine craftsmen , so I ' m sure they would have been very good at tattooing ,  " says Antoine . 
Previously archaeologists thought that tattooing was applied only to women , for fertility or even erotic reasons . The new discovery proves that it involved both sexes . 
The mummies , known officially as " Gebelein Man A " and " Gebelein woman ,  " named after the town in the southern part of Upper Egypt , near Luxor , where they were first discovered , have been part of the British Museum ' s collection for years . 
The Gebelein man has been on display since his discovery 100 years ago , and is one of the museum ' s most popular attractions . A post-mortem carried out in 2012 , indicates that he was aged between 18 and 21 when he died , and had suffered a stab wound to the back . Tufts of ginger-colored hair can still be seen on his scalp .

However , the dark smudges on his arms had been overlooked until Antoine , in charge of all human remains , started conservation work on the mummies and decided to examine their skin with infrared imaging . 
New technologies advance old research
Antoine hopes the results inspire other museums to start new research on their existing collections .  " It ' s an opportunity for me to demonstrate that even though some of the collection we have in the museum has been here for a long time , as the science and the technology evolves there ' s always new opportunities to find out more ,  " he says . 
The oldest example of tattoos are on the Alpine mummy known as Ötzi , thought to have lived between 3370 and 3100 BC , so almost contemporary with the Gebelein pair . 
But the iceman ' s tattoos consist of geometric patterns , rather than figurative images . The locations of Ötzi ' s tattoos , on acupuncture or healing points , suggest that they were used as a pain relief treatment , whereas the tattoos on the Egyptian mummies were on highly visible areas , designed to be shown off . 
Antoine says that this it what makes the find so special -- it suggests tattoos were an art form .  " People are mirroring on their bodies what they are also displaying elsewhere ,  " he says .
