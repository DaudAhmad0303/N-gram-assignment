GREEK AND ROMAN COINS 
General 
The earliest form of commercial exchange was barter. A number of flint axes or 
corn grains might be given, say, for a horse. The biggest problem, however, was to 
decide just how many axes or grains a horse was worth. This was solved by a 
community's agreeing to take an article in common use as a basic unit of value. The 
Saxons chose grains of corn; the early Greeks, a drachma, or handful of iron spits. A 
metal unit proved very convenient, especially for its portability, so metal units became 
more and more common. The early Italians used bars or ingots of bronze for their 
standard unit of value because copper was relatively easy to obtain. For a similar reason 
the Greeks chose silver. So did the Saxons: twenty-four grains of corn were found to be 
balanced, literally, by a quantity of silver, which became known as a pennyweight. 
Once the metal was chosen and the quantity to be regarded as the unit of value 
was fixed, that quantity was made up (with strict attention to quality) and stamped with 
the mark of the maker as a guarantee of correct weight. These primitive coins, for that 
is what they were, served as goods themselves, rather than money as we understand the 
term. This is why quality and quantity were both all-important. 
Slowly the idea of a token coinage evolved: a community agreed to use as its 
unit of value coins whose face value had no relation to the value of the material from 
which they were made. The earliest known example of token coins is the series of 
electrum an amalgam of gold and silver coins produced by the inhabitants of Lydia 
in the sixth and seventh centuries B.C. All bore the same badge, a lion's head, the 
traditional emblem of the Mermnad dynasty, and fell into weight groups, apparently 
designed to serve as fractions of the same basic unit. The Romans were to take the 
same step in 289 B.C., when they set up a state mint to produce coins in a bronze unit, 
the as. Even though in 217 B.C. the Republic turned to minting mainly silver coins 
(thanks to the acquisition of Spain with its abundance of silver mines), the as remained 
at least the nominal unit and was to do so until Roman coinage ended in the fifth 
century A.O. 
Furthermore, even after ancient local communities adopted a token coinage, the 
intrinsic value of their standard coins continued to be all-important for foreign trade, for 
debts abroad were regularly settled in cash, which was accepted at its bullion value, not 
its face value. Hence, the standard coin, or stater, of Athens and other leading silvermarketing cities never became a token piece as long as they kept their autonomy.

The noun "coin" has come into English from the Latin cuneus and the French 
coin, both of which mean "wedge". The French word also acquired the meaning "die, 
stamp", from the wedge-shape of a die. Originally, however, large Greek and Roman 
bronze coins were produced by casting, as it was almost impossible to find dies strong 
enough to produce pieces over an inch in diameter. Some bronze coins were minted by 
a combination of casting and striking. Silver coins, being smaller, could be struck quite 
readily. A frieze of Cupid coin-makers in the House of the Vettii brothers at Pompeii 
throws valuable light on the techniques involved.

With the simplest arrangement for striking, as illustrated, a mint worker found it 
very difficult to achieve axial coordination between the obverse and the reverse of his 
coins; that is the design on one side would most likely be along a different axis from 
that on the other side. Off-centre striking was also prevalent. Various aids were, 
therefore, devised to guide the striker, such as rims around the design, projecting "pegs" 
in the reverse with corresponding holes in the obverse, and (probably) hinged dies. On 
the other hand, while modem mints have obviated such technical problems, the 
perfection of their coins frequently appears sterile in contrast to the lively individuality 
of ancient coins. 
The earliest Greek and Roman coins were stamped on the obverse only. The 
obverse type, or distinctive mark, served to show what person or what city was 
3 
responsible for minting the coin. A person displayed his seal or, much later, his own 
portrait; a city, its distinctive badge, e.g. the turtle for Aegina, the owl for Athens. 
The introduction of reverse types served a variety of purposes: to distinguish one 
denomination from another, to indicate the mint or mint-master responsible for the coin, 
or to commemorate some notable achievement or event. The last use was particularly 
common in Roman coins of the late Republic and the Empire. One striking difference 
between Greek and Roman coins is that, on the former, types were changed far less 
frequently. Obverse types persisted year after year, and, except for the need to show a 
change of symbol for a new moneyer, usually no more often than once a year, reverses 
were just as stable. 
Greek Coins 
The ancient Greeks minted coins of high artistic quality. This is particularly true 
of cities of little commercial importance: for these the striking of really beautiful coins 
was a sure means of winning wealth and prominence. The outstanding example is Elis, 
within whose territory and under whose superintendence the Olympic games were 
celebrated. The coins contributed by visitors to the games were restruck with the city's 
own artistic types and marketed as souvenirs just as a modem city might sell picture 
postcards. The results form an illustrious chapter in the history of Greek art. 
The aesthetic qualities of the coins of such important commercial centres as 
Athens and Corinth are bound up with other considerations (see on coins 2 and 11). 
Certainly, their use as bullion in foreign trade provided little incentive to depart from 
the city badge and deity as leading types. As a result, it is unusual to find any direct 
historical allusions in Greek coins before Alexander. Personal portraiture was barred by 
tradition. A moneyer, or mint-master, could do no more than display his symbol, which 
would convey little to the ordinary citizen. Apart from revealing alliances or the 
subjection of one state to another, therefore, Greek coins often present a challenge to the 
historical imagination that is truly tantalising (see on coin 2). A pleasing exception is 
the coinage of Greek Italy and Sicily, which from the first was much given to historical 
and personal allusions. After Anaxilas, the tyrant of Rhegium, for example, had scored 
a win in the Olympic races, he included a mule-car on his coins. 
The main information conveyed on Greek coins, however, is economic. Some 
cities of the Greek west are justly famous for depicting in their coin types picturesque 
local products or services, such as the crab of Acragas, the satyr revelling in the spa 
waters of Himera, or the Dionysus and grapes of Sicilian Naxos. Compare in Australian 
pre-decimal currency the merino sheep on the shilling and the ears of wheat on the 
threepence. Certainly attractive advertising is always good economics. Again, the wide 
dispersion of Athenian and Corinthian staters and the imitation of Athenian owls and 
4 
Corinthian ponies on the coins of other peoples provide a useful means of tracing 
commercial connections. The coins also provide information about denominations and 
weight standards. Apart from this they have much to say to the student of religion, 
especially as a theme in the visual arts. Perhaps the biggest difficulty in the 
interpretation of Greek coins is the fact that there are still so many gaps in our 
information. Not all surviving coins have yet been recorded. There is, moreover, an 
even chance that any issue totalling 5,000 coins or fewer has been lost forever. The 
study of ancient coins, in other words, still lags some years behind certain other 
branches of archaeology - and centuries behind the study of literary sources. 
With the establishment of Alexander's empire, the Greek city-states lost their 
independence forever. The change in political organisation is reflected in the coinage. 
Advertising types of particular cities tended to disappear, as the coins which bore them 
rarely travelled away from their home territory. Such coins now offered the craftsman 
less scope for his talents and suffered an artistic decline. Though a few cities, such as 
Athens and Corinth, were permitted to issue coins as of old, most were reduced to 
minting undistinguished pieces in silver and bronze, which served as small change. 
Now the most beautiful and prestigious coins were minted by Alexander and the rulers 
who partitioned his Empire after his death. Alexander's tetradrachms (coin 15), which 
circulated throughout the Empire, were based on the Atttic weight standard, which 
consequently became the most important in the world. The Hellenistic era saw the 
gradual arrival of a new fashion in Greek coins, the portrayal of actual rulers. It began 
with the posthumous portrait of Alexander in heroic style (coin 19). Except for Persian 
imperial coins, which had depicted living rulers, this was without precedent. Greeks of 
bygone days would have considered it sacrilegious to portray a human being on their 
coins, yet, from the time of Julius Caesar on, the practice became widespread on Roman 
coins, and today we take it for granted. 
Coins of the Roman Republic 
The primitive communities of Italy were mainly agricultural and had few trade 
links. At the bartering stage their commonest units of value were cattle and sheep: the 
Latin word for "money", pecunia, is cognate with pecus, "cattle". The first metal 
currency employed consisted of rough bronze lumps of varying weight, aes rude. When 
the Roman mint was established - the traditional date is 289 B.C. - these gave place to 
rectangular cast ingots, aes signatum, stamped with a variety of devices, including a 
bull, which is perhaps a direct link with the days of barter. 
The first circular coinage soon followed. This was a bronze piece, weighing 
about one pound and named, not inappropriately, aes graue. Rome's standard currency 
unit had arrived: the coin was stamped with the numeral I, meaning one as. This was 
5 
divided into smaller denominations, whose weight variation was offset by 
distinguishing marks which clearly defined their face value. 
Early in the third century B.C., thanks to the war with Pyrrhus, Rome was 
brought into contact with the Greek cities of southern Italy, such as Tarentum, Neapolis 
and Metapontum. Fighting gave place to trading and the result was a number of 
extraordinary issues of silver didrachms. These were made by Greek artists, in the 
Greek style, from Greek silver. Their types were carefully designed to appeal to Greek 
tastes. Most of the obverses depicted deities which were common to Greeks and 
Romans, such as Mars (Ares), Apollo, Hercules (Herakles) and Victory (Nike). There 
was also, however, an occasional Roma and, invariably, the legend ROMANO, an 
abbreviation for the genitive ROMANORVM. 
The next step was silver coins for local use: the heavy as must have been 
extremely inconvenient for everyday use. The new coins gradually took on a distinctly 
Roman character. First came didrachms with Hercules/wolf and twins types. The year 
was 269 B.C. The First Punic War resulted in Roma/Victory didrachms. Then in 235 
B.C. came a series of Janus/ROMA, Jupiter with Victory in quadriga coins. These were 
known as quadrigati ( coin 25). The half-piece soon followed, first with similar types, 
and then with obverse Jupiter, reverse ROMA, Victory crowning a trophy of weapons, 
as a result of which they were known as victoriati ( coin 28). 
The greater frequency of silver coins completed t� process by which the bronze 
coinage was assigned a token value. As a result the as, which originally weighed one 
pound, was finally reduced to an ounce in 155 B.C. The value of ten such pieces was 
then expressed by a new coin, the denarius, a term destined to live on in the mediaeval 
denier, the modem dinar, and the formula £.S.D. The denarius in its first form depicted 
a helmeted Roma, backed by Castor and Pollux ( coin 32). The half-piece was called a 
quinarius ( coin 29), and a final sub-division was the sestertius (2 Yz asses). Strangely 
enough, although the silver sestertius soon disappeared from circulation, the term 
persisted in everyday parlance the English guinea provides a parallel - to the extent 
that large sums of money were regularly reckoned in sestertii. If, for example, someone 
boasted he was worth a million, this was invariably taken to mean sestertii, not denarii. 
For all practical purposes, however, the denarius was now the basic unit of currency. 
The Second Punic War caused great advances in Roman coinage. Armies were 
dispersed over a great number of fronts and new territories were acquired. Where 
necessary, army commanders were given powers of coinage, in order to pay their 
troops. Many branch mints sprang up, each with its own mint-master. Not only was 
there a proliferation of types on denarii, but it became the practice for each moneyer to 
identify himself, first by a symbol, and later by his actual name, abbreviated to a greater 
or lesser degree. In some cases the result was a cluttered legend, but at least the 
numismatist had a helpful guide to dating the coin. 
6 
Rome was now the centre of a vast empire, acquired through the patriotism, 
sagacity and heroic deeds of her great men. She was imbued with a strong national 
consciousness and a sense of destiny. Her aristocracy in particular had better grounds 
than ever before for giving vent to the pride of ancestry, which was so strong within 
them. One of the major preoccupations of the Roman character was the concept of 
gloria, the esteem achieved for oneself and one's family in the eyes of present and 
future generations. In an age when men had scant expectations of surviving in a life 
beyond the grave, the pursuit of gloria was seen to offer immortality of a sort: an 
everlasting renown among generations yet to be born. The desire for gloria constantly 
appears in Roman literature. After the Second Punic War it was a dominating influence 
in the production of Roman coins. Moneyers, who were elected from the aristocracy, 
seized the opportunity of commemorating in their coins the achievements of their 
illustrious forebears. Apart from alluding to specific historic events (coins 37, 43, 45, 
4 7, 50), they included types illustrating their family legends and traditions ( coins 40, 
47), the deities their ancestors supposedly worshipped (coins 35, 37, 39, 45, 50), or the 
heroes best typifying their ancestors' achievements (coin 41?). The resulting coins were 
of a high artistic standard, distinguished by higher relief, noble portraiture and an 
attractive spaciousness. 
During the last fifty years of the Republic the coinage was dominated by the 
towering personalities of the age. The emphasis now changed from the achievements of 
past generations, to the recent exploits of Marius and his followers ( coin 39), Sulla, the 
Pompeys (coin 53), Caesar (coins 49, 51, 52), Antony (coins 54, 55) and Octavian (coin 
54). From Pompey the Great onwards, personal portraiture came into its own. After 
routing the pirates Pompey issued a gold coin with reverse depicting himself standing in 
a four-horse chariot - the first time a living person had appeared on a coin struck in 
Rome itself. In 44 B.C. Julius Caesar received from a complaisant Senate the right of 
being portrayed in profile. As dictator he held the Roman state in the palm of his hand, 
and it is clear from his coins that the moneyers were quick to take their cue. Roman 
coinage was now completely personal and topical, and it was to remain so till well into 
the third century A.D. 
Coins of the Roman Empire 
One of Augustus' most important powers was the control of coinage. The world 
was at peace once more and an ever increasing supply of coins was needed to facilitate 
the peaceful pursuits of agriculture, commerce and industry. Mines and mints were 
under government control. At first Augustus allowed the Senatorial mint at Rome to 
strike coins in gold, silver and bronze, though his profile was the standard obverse type. 
In 12 B.C. he took over the right of minting the precious metal coins and established a 
new mint at Lugdunum in Gaul for this purpose. This mint was later (probably under 
Gaius) transferred to Rome for greater convenience. Henceforth, branch mints operated 
7 
only from time to time and their output was relatively low. The Senate continued to 
mint coins in copper and brass, but its control was more theoretical than real: the 
emperor's portrait and titles were just as common on S.C. coins (see below, Common 
Abbreviations in Roman Imperial Coin Legends) as on coins issued by the imperial 
mint. For this, of course, the numismatist is grateful, as the combination of titles and 
names is indispensable to the accurate identification and dating of coins. 
For Roman emperors coins were a vital means of proclaiming every changing 
nuance of their achievements and policies. Modem governments and rulers have other 
means at their disposal: the press, radio, television, postage stamps, Websites or even 
"Dial-a-Politician" (periodically available to all Americans who own a telephone). 
Roman emperors, lacking such aids, made the most of the opportunities offered by their 
coins. For this reason, coin types changed with a rapidity quite foreign to us. The year 
A.D. 139, for example, in the reign of Antoninus Pius, was a prolific year in coinage but 
not exceptionally so. In this one year the standard denarius had a hundred reverse types; 
the sestertius (revived as a brass piece in imperial times), more than fifty; and this is to 
say nothing of other denominations. 
First and foremost, coins offered an emperor an unrivalled means of 
disseminating his features. All images of the emperor were sacred, intended as objects 
of veneration, and coin portraits were no exception. Indeed, the very process of minting 
coins was under divine patronage: the Roman mint was established in the temple of 
Juno Moneta (whence our "money", "monetary") on the Capitoline Hill. Most modem 
autocrats have shown a similar enthusiasm for exhibiting their features, often by means 
of greater than life-size pictures prominently displayed. George Orwell's description in 
Nineteen Eighty-Four of portraits of Big Brother constructed so that the gaze is always 
directed at the beholder, is painfully close to reality. As one might expect then, the 
heads on Roman imperial coins are usually very fine. Some are, in a way, too fine, 
showing clear signs of idealisation and rejuvenation. 
The reverses are filled with a great variety of news and views, including (a) 
personifications of blessings (coins 76, 77, 84, 86, 115), virtues (coins 86, 88, 117, 128, 
162) and provinces (coins 96, 101, 131, 135); (b) anniversaries and commemorations 
(coins 58, 63, 68, 108, 176); (c) cunent events (coins 59, 69, 71, 78, 89, 94, 104, 113, 
116, 145, 160, 174, 181, 188); (d) mere pious hopes or wishful thinking (coins 70, 83, 
107, 119, 132, 141, 143, 149, 180, 186); (e) invoking the memory of a revered 
predecessor ( coins 64, 65, 75, 93, 118); and (f) claiming ( or proclaiming) the help of a 
particular deity (coins 79, 80, 81, 97, 136, 142, 146, 152, 154, 173). 
Clearly Roman imperial coins are important as historical source material. Often 
they help to counterbalance the hostile account of an emperor in literary sources, though 
of course they commonly en in the opposite direction. They can often be used to 
conoborate or conect information gleaned from other sources, such as literature, 
inscriptions or state records. Occasionally they are our sole source of knowledge. 
8 
Above all, however, their pictorial power, conveyed in high relief quite foreign to 
modern coins, can be quite overwhelming. The fact that they are so plentiful and 
inexpensive is a boon to students of Roman history. 
The one danger in dealing with coins of the Empire is the temptation to accept 
them at their face value, in the way one can normally accept inscriptions. Coinage was 
a virtual monopoly of the emperors. Sometimes it told the truth; sometimes, a part of 
the truth. At other times it was over-optimistic or quite untruthful. For the modern 
scholar who is prepared to approach it critically, however, it holds a far greater wealth 
of information than it can ever have held for the subjects of imperial Rome.

Where legends are "telescoped", as often occurs on coins of the Roman 
Republic, they are, nevertheless, given in full in coin descriptions for the sake of clarity. 
Similarly, a dot is inserted after a letter or word of a legend to show that it is an 
13 
abbreviation. No attempt is made to indicate the actual presence or absence of dots on 
the coin itself. Where desired, this can be ascertained from the reference cited. If a 
legend is partly obliterated, missing letters are supplied in square brackets.

Torone, or Terone, situated on the Sithonian peninsula, was a prosperous 
Chalcidian colony. During the supremacy of Athens, to which period this coin belongs, 
the town seems to have struck no larger denomination than the tetrobol. The fact that it 
contributed from six to twelve talents every year to Athens, however, indicates that it 
was a place of imp01iance. 
The oinochoe is appropriate: Torone was famous for its wine.

As with most Greek coins of the sixth and fifth centuries B.C., this coin was 
struck with a punch die, whose face was smaller than the flan, or metal blank. The 
reverse, consequently, has a central incuse with a rim rising all round. The owl was the 
badge of Athens. The legend gives the first three letters of the city name. 
The coin is typical of Greek coins in that historical allusions are, to say the least, 
indirect. The olive leaves on Athena's helmet, for example, appear from around 480 
B.C. onwards, but it is quite uncertain whether they refer to the battles of Marathon or 
Salamis, to the establishment of democracy, or to something else again. The origin of 
the crescent moon is similarly uncertain. One attractive suggestion is that the battle of 
Marathon was fought at this stage of the lunar cycle, and that the moon device is a 
subtle dig at Sparta: the Spartans, when asked for assistance, maintained that they could 
not set out for the battle until the coming of the full moon. As a result they arrived after 
the Athenians and their Plataean allies had won the battle on their own. A simpler 
theory is that the moon is the symbol of the nocturnal owl. 
The persistence and wide dispersion of Athenian coins in the ancient world are 
astonishing. It is certain that they were minted until Sulla sacked the city and its port 
Piraeus in 86 B.C. One view holds that they continued until the middle of the first 
century B.C. If this is so, it is due to the centuries of long recognition of Athens as the 
principal custodian of Greek culture: certainly her commercial significance after the 
onslaught of Sulla was nil. Imitations of the coins were likewise persistent. In 4 10 B.C. 
the Persian satrap Tissaphernes supplied financial help to Athens' enemies. The coins 
he struck were at first glance remarkably similar to Athens' standard coin, the 
tetradrachm. The weight standard was precisely the same. The owl reverse was still 
being copied in Arabia at the end of the first century B.C. 
Aristophanes (Frogs 722) through his Chorus proclaimed not only that the 
tetradrachms of Athens were the only ones correctly struck and refined, but that they 
were the most beautiful of all. The first claim is incontestable; the second is open to 
dispute. In the time of Aristophanes (c. 450 - c. 385 B.C.) the designs of Athenian 
coins were merely reproductions of those which had been introduced a century or so 
before. There was no evidence of artistic progress. One instance of this is the frontal 
stare of the eye in Athena's profile. On the other hand, Athens' first object in minting 
coins was to put raw silver from her mines at Laurium into a form convenient to her 
commercial customers. For men such as these, aesthetic appeal was a secondary 
consideration. Indeed any change in the appearance of the coins could have resulted in 
distrust and loss of popularity. As it was, the international significance of fifth century 
Athenian coinage is demonstrated, for example, by the many large consignments 
discovered within the Persian Empire. A single hoard, unearthed in Egypt in 1946, 
16 
numbered roughly 10,000 pieces - an indication of the financial stability of Athens at 
the peak of her supremacy. One might compare the continuing use of Austrian Maria 
Theresa thalers in the Middle East today.

3. Hemidrachm, Thebes, 426-395 B.C. 
Obv. Boeotian shield. 
Rev. Kantharos with club above, 0EBH below, all within incuse square. 
When the Boeotian League rose again under the leadership of Thebes in 447 
B.C., the Theban mint entered a peiod of sustained activity. The Boeotian shield was 
universal on the obverses of Theban coins until the city was destroyed by Alexander in 
335 B.C. The choice of this type is apparently due to the fact that the kind of shield 
depicted was made from ox-hide, and, according to ancient grammarians, the words 
Boeotia and �ou<; (Gk. "ox") are etymologically linked. 
The club on the reverse is an attribute of Herakles, one of the city's two 
favourite deities. The other, Dionysus, is represented by the kantharos.

POAION 
As the Greek word for Rhodes,· P68oi;, with a change of termination also means 
"rose" (p 68ov ), the flower was adopted as a symbol of the island. 
In the Middle Ages, the head of Helios, patron deity of Rhodes, was taken, 
especially when radiate, to represent the glorified Christ ( cf. on coin 167); and the rose, 
as the rose of Sharon, a plain in West Israel renowned for its rich, deep soil and the 
many-hued flowers that adorn it in spring

5. Drachma, Sicyon, c. 400-323 B.C. 
Obv. Chimera, head and right foreleg raised. 
Rev. Flying dove. 
At the beginning of the fourth century B.C., Sicyon entered on a period of great 
commercial prosperity, as its abundant coinage shows. 
The chimera was a hybrid monster, with a lion's head, a goat's body and a 
dragon's tail. It has been seen as a symbol of rushing torrents, as destructive as lions, as 
unpredictable as goats and as winding as snakes. It may be connected with Aigialeia, an 
ancient name of Sicyon, after Aigialeus, its first king. The dove is a link with the local 
cult of Aphrodite: the dove, the swan, the swallow and the sparrow are often mentioned 
as drawing her chariot or serving as her messengers.

Obv. Bee with straight wings dividing E-<l>. 
Rev. Forepmi of kneeling stag right, looking left; date-palm behind, 
magistrate's name before, XENOITIOl:. 
In the fourth century B.C., with Athens' power diminished and Persia on the 
defensive, Ephesus struck a long and abundant series of tetradrachms. 
The coinage of Ephesus is dominated by the cult of Artemis. The bee, a fertility 
symbol regularly found on copies of her cult statue, is a reminder of her universal 
motherhood; the stag, of Artemis, the huntress. The palm tree symbolises the one under 
which Artemis was born. 
19 
Since probably almost 200 magistrates' names are known, these cannot stand for 
single annual magistrates. As different names are sometimes associated with the same 
obverse die, the minting of coins at Ephesus was possibly supervised by annual boards 
of three or more magistrates, as happened later at Athens and Rome.

Rev. Slinger wearing chiton, discharging sling. Triskeles of human legs; bird

incuse square with dotted border. 
The triskeles was the local badge of Aspendus, a hellenized town which 
contained the principal mint of Pamphylia, a district in Asia Minor. A variant of the 
swastika, it typifies the whirling sun and symbolises energy, motion or victory. It is still 
to be found on the heraldic badges of Sicily and the Isle of Man. The slinger reverse, 
which was used in a long series from c. 400 B.C., may have been chosen because the 
Greek word for "slinger" (cr<j)Evoovi)trJ<;) bears some resemblance to the name of the 
town. 
Linguistic evidence shows that most of the inhabitants of Aspendus were of 
Anatolian origin, and the reverse legend reflects this.

Philip built up a professional army with strong esprit de corps, which was the 
basis for his son Alexander's army. He developed siegecraft, used the phalanx 
formation and offensive and defensive wings. He was a master of war, diplomacy and 
politics.

Philip himself, than the Macedonian 'Ares'." (Price, p. 22)

Obv. Pegasus.

Rev. Athena, wearing Corinthian helmet. 
N 
21 
Pegasus had a special connection with Corinth: by stamping his hoof on the rock 
of Akrokorinthos he opened up the spring of Peirene. Thus Pegasus was always the 
obverse type for Corinthian silver coins, which were consequently nicknamed 1trotcot 
("ponies") throughout Greece. The tiny Q-shaped letter beneath the horse, the initial 
letter of Corinth, persisted long after it had passed from general usage and been 
supplanted in ordinary Greek writing by the letter K. 
Athena was always the reverse type for the Corinthian stater, or standard coin, 
reckoned as a three-drachma piece. The drachma and its fractions were given other 
types. While Corinthian coins types thus changed relatively little, the handling of detail 
and the general execution of the dies show a constant advance in style. This may be 
seen, for example, in the engraving of the horse's wings or in the treatment of Athena's 
eye: the earliest coins showed the eye facing incongruously to the front; later ones 
depicted it more naturalistically, in keeping with the remainder of the profile. The 
reason probably lies in the fact that Corinth exported mainly westwards: Italians and 
Sicilians had a keener eye for beauty than Egyptians or Phoenicians. N is almost 
certainly the initial of a moneyer. 
Corinth drew its silver supplies from "barbarian" tribes, to whom the drachma 
meant nothing. The Corinthians, therefore, when settling on their standard, had no need 
22 
to consider the implications it might carry for those who had mined the silver, but 
simply fixed their price to the Greek market as sellers.

Apollo's hair is engraved in fine detail, and the reverse is characterised by 
vigorous action. Philip's gold coins correspond with his grand vision of a pan-Hellenic 
empire. The obverse is a reference to the sanctuary at Delphi, the site of the famous 
oracle of Apollo. Philip presided over the games there in 346. As a result he gained 
powerful influence over Greek political affairs. The chariot reflects his successes in this 
regard, as well as at Olympia.

[Ill)8QAAPOY 
Caria, a mountain district of Asia Minor, passed under the sovereignty of Persia 
in 546 B.C. A line of native princes managed to establish themselves, however, and 
their authority extended in time even to the Greek colonies established along its 
coastline. 
These coin types were established by Mausolus, a vigorous Hellenizer and satrap 
of Caria from 377 to 353 B.C., and would have appealed to the colonists. 
The facing head of Apollo was inspired by the similar head of Helios on the 
contemporary coinage of Rhodes. The attitude of Zeus recalls in part the pose of 
Mausolus as he is depicted in the statue from the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus, erected 
in his memory by his widow Artemisia. 
The types were carried on by Mausolus' three successors, one of whom was 
Pixodarus.

The types of Athena and Nike would have appealed to Greeks everywhere. The 
stylis, or mast, is usually the symbol of a naval victory. While Nike clearly recalls the

The coin was struck in Babylon, which became the most important of the 
Alexandrian mints after Amphipolis. The abundant bullion seized by Alexander from 
the Persian treasuries at Susa and Persepolis helps to explain why the Babylon mint was 
so prolific: in a space of thirteen years it employed no fewer than 170 obverse and 500 
reverse dies. The mintmark M (for Metropolis) is a pointer to the importance of 
Babylon as the centre of Alexander's Empire. 
The choice of types is significant: Herakles and Zeus, besides being revered 
throughout Greece, had their counterparts elsewhere: Melqart in Phoenicia, Baal in 
Tarsus, and Gilgamesh and Bel-Marduk in Babylon. The coin, therefore, is a visible 
example of Alexander's efforts to unify his Empire. Furthermore, Herakles was the 
legendary ancestor of the Macedonian royal house, and the Herakles type aptly 
symbolises Alexander's own heroic achievements as an empire builder.

The original idea for the types used on this coin came from a Cretan Neuantos, 
one of only two die-engravers known to us who left their names on their coins (the other 
was Theodotus of Clazomenae). Since Neuantos' name is missing from this coin, and 
the dies are not specially prepossessing, they were apparently made by a lesser engraver 
in imitation of the work of Neuantos. Indeed, the existence of fine dies side by side 
with similar ones of poorer quality is characteristic of the coins of all Cretan cities.

The generals who partitioned Alexander's empire after his death, while tending 
to place their own names on their coins, maintained for many years the Herakles-Zeus 
types of Alexander (coin 15). Lysimachus, however, chose to preserve the memory of 
Alexander in a new and striking way: he replaced Herakles with a magnificent profile of 
Alexander. The temple of Jupiter Ammon, situated in the deserts of Libya, had an 
oracle who declared Alexander to be the son of Jupiter. This flattery destroyed its longestablished reputation, and by the time of Plutarch it was scarcely known. Lysimachus, 
however, deemed it fitting that the oracle's pronouncement be commemorated in the 
obverse portrait of this coin. Unlike coins of the Persian and Roman Empires, Greek 
coins never bore the p01iraits of living rulers. 
Athena's Nike is about to set a wreath on the initial letter of Lysimachus, a 
somewhat fatuous allegorical device. The very large mint-mark signifies that the coin 
was minted in Ionia.

The trrrrct<; ("horsemen") of Tarentum, which the Greeks called Taras, were the

spread throughout Magna Graecia and into other parts of Italy as well. After the third 
century they gradually yielded to Roman coins. The horseman obverse was varied 
constantly: he might be either man or boy; he could be riding, walking beside his horse 
or dismounting. On the other hand, variation in the dolphin reverse was confined 
mainly to the objects held by the eponymous Taras, son of Poseidon. The "horsemen" 
show a consistently high standard of artistry and technical skill. The legends are 
probably the abbreviated signatures of magistrates or mint officials.

In the fourth and third centuries B.C. Syracuse was the sole surviving Greek 
mint of importance in Sicily. The ordinary silver coins of King Hieron II of Syracuse 
appeared probably throughout the middle and later years of his reign. The pleasant 
portrait of Philistis, Hieron's queen, resembles in style the heads appearing on Seleucid 
and Ptolemaic issues of the same period. Hieron modestly refrained from placing his 
own head on his coins, whether gold or silver (we can except the 32-litra piece, which 
may perhaps be seen as a medal rather than a coin): he preferred to commemorate his 
wife (the daughter of a private citizen and, therefore, probably more acceptable to the 
democratic party in the state) and his son, Gelon.

The coin reflects Philip's Roman connections only in a minor detail: the winged 
helmet, crowned with the forepart of a griffin, resembles that depicted on the head of 
Roma on Roman denarii. As for the portrait on the shield, Philip's son was called 
Perseus. The club on the reverse is that of Hercules. The oak wreath symbolises Zeus. 
The griffin, a hybrid animal, unites the terrestrial strength of the lion with the 
celestial energies of the eagle. This appears to be the image of himself that Philip 
wished to project on his coins.

The reverse reflects Antiochus' promotion of Hellenism in the East and 
particularly his belief in the civilising power of the worship of Zeus Olympios. In the 
34 
Hellenistic age Zeus' name was freely bestowed on the principal deity of any non-Greek 
people or religion, and Antiochus in turn presented himself as the earthly manifestation 
of Zeus. Cf. Aeschylus, Fragment 105: "Zeus is ether, Zeus is earth, Zeus is sky, Zeus 
is everything and more than that." 
The type recalls Pheidias' chryselephantine colossus of Zeus enthroned, a 
reproduction of which was set up by Antiochus in the temple of Apollo at Daphne, near 
Antioch. Even the Temple in Jerusalem was given over to the worship of Zeus. The 
altar used for this purpose is described in Daniel 11.3 1 as "the abomination of 
desolation", a Hebrew pun on its dedication to "the lord of heaven". 
Depending on the exact date of minting, the reverse could also be taken to 
commemorate Antiochus' highly successful war against Egypt ( 17 1- 168), which 
continued till Rome forced him to abandon the siege of Alexandria in 168.

The head of the Sabine king Titus Tatius and the reference to the abduction of 
the Sabine women clearly suggest a Sabine origin for the moneyer's family. According 
to tradition, Tatius was a Sabine king who, after the Romans abducted the Sabine 
women, captured the Capitol with the aid of the perfidious Tarpeia. Other theories are 
that he was merely the eponym of the Tities tribe, or that his alleged joint reign with

Obv. Jupiter, laureate. 
s.c. 
Rev. Victory in quadriga, holding wreath and palm-branch. 
Q.ANTO.BALB.PR. 
In view of Balbus' end, the victorious note of the coin is not without irony. 
While serving as praetor in Sardinia under Marius in 82 B.C., he was ousted and slain 
by Sulla's legate L. Marcius Philippus. The reverse type, however, is so general that it 
is impossible to apply it with any certainty to any particular member of the moneyer's 
family. 
The coin belongs to one of a number of special issues minted at Rome in 82 B.C. 
in addition to the ordinary coinage. These issues were apparently occasioned by the 
current political upheaval at Rome, in which the Marians were ousted and Sulla 
triumphed. Early in 82 the Senate, dominated by the Marian party, took treasures from 
the temples and had them melted down for the payment of Marius' troops. Hence, the 
obverse legend S.C. In particular, it would seem that Balbus was permitted to mint his 
coins to provide for the expenses of his forces in Sardinia.

The coin recalls a famous incident in Greek mythology. Marsyas 
challenged Apollo in an oboe-playing contest, lost, and was flayed alive by his 
opponent. 
The reverse type is also a pun on the name of the moneyer, a member of the gens 
Marcia. Cf. coin 47.

C.POBLICI Q.F. 
In a time of rising political tension at Rome, serration, or edge-marking, was 
used to demonstrate that the party in power was not issuing, through its moneyers, coins 
41 
which were merely plated and, therefore, worthless. When one considers the volume of 
coinage involved, serration, a manual process, must have required a tremendous amount 
of labour. On the other hand, excellent base metal forgeries have been found, in which 
a thin silver wash has effectively defeated the purpose of the serrated edge. 
The reverse type echoes earlier coins of Neapolis, Tarentum and Heraclea. 
Since, however, there is no known allusion to the moneyer's family, the reference is 
possibly to the recent victory of Sulla over the Marian party. The recording of current 
events on coins as early as this is unusual, but not unparalleled.

The obverse provides the first instance of a moneyer recording on his coins his 
office of triumvir of the mint. The reverse alludes to the Sicilian Slave War conducted 
by the consul Mn. Aquillius, probably a grandfather of the moneyer, in 101 B.C. His 
success was rewarded with a triumph on his return to Rome.

54 B.C. and tribune of the plebs in 49 B.C. in association with M. Antony. 
The letters A and C stand for absoluo and condemno. The reference is to a 
prosecution in 1 37 B.C. by the moneyer's forebear Quintus Cassius against two Vestals 
on charges of misconduct. The um was to receive the tablets on which one of the two 
letters was written.

Orodes was the conqueror of Crassus in 53 B.C. While there is no direct 
reference to this crushing achievement, the subsequent burgeoning of Parthia's 
economy is demonstrated by the remarkable number of coins minted for Orodes. The 
reverse type is appropriate: the Parthians were renowned for their horse archers. 
The obverse portrait is striking for its distinctive pointed beard, long waved hair 
and angular features. 
The reverse legend translates, "King of Kings, the Benefactor, the Just, God 
Manifest, Philhellene".

AQV A MR.PHILIPPVS 
The coin is a reminder firstly of the aqueduct alleged to have been built by 
Ancus Marcius, fourth king of Rome. The statue depicts Q. Marcius Rex, who, as 
praetor in 144 B.C., was commissioned by the Senate to repair old aqueducts and to 
build a new one which would bring a supply of water to Rome. The statue was erected 
in commemoration of his work. 
The Marcian gens claimed descent from Ancus Marcius. The augur's staff 
possibly refers to the priestly offices and ceremonies instituted by the early kings of 
Rome. The flower beneath the horse has been identified as the Martialis, a punning 
allusion to the name Marcia. Juno is said to have become pregnant by Mars through 
touching this flower. For a similar numismatic pun, see coin 40.

These coins date from the period immediately predating the Roman conquest of 
Egypt. Despite variations in the head, many numismatists believe them all to be stylised 
portraits of Ptolemy II. The eagle was sacred to Zeus and, in Egypt, identified with 
major local deities such as Ammon. The thunderbolt is the commonest attribute of 
· Zeus. 
L is the symbol for "year". It is possibly an abbreviated form of the Greek E, 
the initial letter of faoua, "year". K is the tenth letter of the Greek alphabet. This 
suggests the coin appeared in the tenth year of Ptolemy XIII's reign, 54 B.C. Ptolemy 
was the younger brother and husband of Cleopatra VII. From 51 to 47 B.C. they were 
co-rulers. Cleopatra subsequently became the lover of Julius Caesar and Mark Antony 
in turn. 
The coins were all found in a single hoard in Egypt. It seems likely the hoard 
was buried to save it from being plundered or stolen during the arrival of Caesar' s army 
and the so-called Alexandrian war. 
The museum has two similar coins without pendant rings.

Sicily. The spoils included 120 elephants, which were transported to Rome.

Caesar in 46 B.C. to administer Rome during his absence in Spain, where he carried on 
the war with Cn. Pompeius the Younger and the remnants of the Pompeian party. The 
coin probably alludes to the triumph of Caesar after his return from Spain in 45 B.C.

[PRAEF.JCLAS.ET ORAE MARIT.EX S.C. 
The obverse is an attempt to perpetuate the memory of Pompey's exploits. The 
p01irait of Pompey has a rugged simplicity. There is no attempt at idealisation or 
rejuvenation. 
In 43 B.C. the Senate put Sextus Pompeius in command of the fleet, with the 
title praefectus class is et orae maritimae ("commander of the fleet and the sea coast"). 
Anapus and Amphinomus were two brothers of Catana (Sicily), who saved their parents 
from a conflagration caused by an eruption of Mt Etna. The coin type perhaps suggests 
that their pietas towards their parents is matched by that of Pompey the Great and his 
son Sextus towards the Roman state; Sextus himself had assumed the title of Pius. 
Again, it may show that the coins were minted at Catana. The figure of Neptune refers 
to Sextus' victory over Octavian's legate Salvidienus, who tried to dislodge him from 
Sicily in 42 B.C. As a result, his soldiers proclaimed himjilius Neptuni.

Octavian, a bond that was to be further strengthened in 40 by the marriage of Antony 
and Octavia, sister of Octavian. In the very year this coin was issued, however, Antony 
met Cleopatra for the first time and the seeds of future discord were sown.

"coining and striking of gold, silver and bronze money" (A.A.A.F.F. = aura, argento,

counterfeited, adulterated or improperly diminished in weight. In short, they were

citizen's life. The Senate commonly conferred it on an emperor at the time of his 
accession. The coin was issued in Spain by a mint under the sole control of Augustus. 
The object of the mint was not merely to furnish soldiers' pay but to produce a 
universally accepted coinage for the Empire. The head is large and in high relief. The

The Icenian coinage in Norfolk and Suffolk is the commonest Celtic coinage in

abbreviated form of a tribal name, the only such example. Others are almost certainly 
personal. The engraving on the reverse is remarkably minute and precise.

53 
Tiberius was called Imperator in a military sense on account of his successes in 
the field. He was voted seven triumphs in all, but celebrated only three. 
The altar erected at Lugdunum to Roma and Augustus was intended as a focus 
of provincial loyalty. 
The Lugdunum mint which issued this coin had a different function from either 
the senatorial mint at Rome or the imperial mint at Lugdunum. It was probably 
controlled by the Cone ilium Galliarum ( an assembly of delegates from the constituent 
cities of the three provinces of Gallia Comata), and its purpose was to keep the Western 
Empire supplied with small change during a period when the senatorial mint at Rome 
was almost inactive. The "Altar" series continued into the reign of Tiberius.

and hard-working. He constructed the Pantheon and many other magnificent buildings

Herod, client king of Judaea (A.D. 37-44), respected his subjects' sensibilities 
by avoiding human and animal figures on his coins - in Judaea. In Caesarea he struck 
them with his own portrait! 
He was the first Jewish ruler to use only Greek letters in his coin legends. The 
legend on the obverse, "King Agrippa", suggests pride in his position. Despite his 
Hellenistic leanings, self-indulgence and extravagance, the Jews revered his memory. 
He seems to have been basically true to Judaism and his people. He remonstrated with 
Gaius over the latter's proposal to put his statue in the temple.

The name of the coin is derived from the tetradrachms issued by Attalus I of 
Pergamum c. 200 B.C., the obverses of which depicted a chest (cista) with a serpent 
crawling out from under a half-open lid. The denomination persisted long after Asia 
Minor became a Roman province, and, even though the original obverse type 
disappeared under Augustus, the name of the coins was unchanged. Their classification 
as medallions, though common, is unwarranted, as the coins formed part of the regular 
currency and bore a fixed value of three denarii or four drachmas.

The portrait is a fine one. "Under Nero we find the vividness of Roman art

The reverse legend translates, "After peace had everywhere been won for the 
Roman people, he closed the temple of Janus." Peace was signed with Parthia in A.D. 
63, and, in accordance with traditional practice, the temple was closed in A.D. 64. Nero

Otho came to the throne with the assistance of the Praetorian Guard, who, at his

suicided on 16 April, 69. 
C.H.V. Sutherland describes the obverse portrait as "neat, well-finished, and 
'civilis' - unwreathed and citizen-like." (Roman Coins, p. 175) 
In a time of notorious political instability, the reverse provides a striking 
example of wishful thinking. 
All of Otho's surviving coins are of gold or silver and minted at Rome. In short, 
for whatever reason, the Senate minted no brass coins in his name. Indeed, the Senate 
never, by any formal act, acknowledged Otho's authority at Rome.

"Was it that Otho refrained from vexing the Senate with a duty that it detested?

In dating the coin within the Jewish revolt of A.D. 66-70, I have adopted the 
view of W. Wirgin and S. Mandel, The History of Coins and Symbols in Ancient Israel 
( 1958), pp. 38-5 1. The authors also demonstrate (pp. 215-221) that the "chalice" may 
actually be a Temple laver. 
The use of peculiarly Jewish types and of ancient Hebrew script is a noteworthy 
expression of national feeling, reminiscent of the shekels minted over two centuries 
earlier by Simon Maccabaeus ( 143- 136 B.C.). The Roman government would rightly 
have viewed the coin as an act of political defiance.

Although the silver quinarius had not been struck for more than a century, 
Vespasian saw fit to revive it. This may have stemmed from a desire to invest his rule 
with a simple, antiquarian, Republican-type aura. One might imagine the effect if the 
farthing were to be revived in British currency today. 
The types are executed with considerable delicacy: Vespasian's typical shortcropped hairstyle can be discerned through a microscope; for a model of Nike the diecutter might well have used an engraved gem, rather than a sculpture or a painting. 
Once Republican quinarii adopted a Victory reverse similar to that of the halfvictoriatus, Victory in one form or another remained the standard reverse type for 
quinarii thereafter.

Vespasian, the "second founder of the Empire", found it politic to use reverse types 
favoured by the first founder, Augustus. The Altar of Providence was one of these. In 
this way, Vespasian sought to win acceptance for his new dynasty and provide it with a 
firm foundation.

The po1trait is strikingly massive and rugged. The obverse legend stresses the 
fact that Vespasian founded a dynasty; in Titus this dynasty is continued. As the reverse 
proclaims, Titus' reign was indeed a reign of peace and plenty.

That Minerva was Domitian's favourite goddess is abundantly clear from the 
remarkable frequency of her appearance on his coins. It was fitting that Domitian 
should place himself under Minerva' s protection: she was patroness both of arms and of 
literature, two fields in which Domitian strove to succeed.

Domitian also waged war against the Marcomanni, the Suebi and the Iasyges. In

of thanks to Jupiter for a successful year's campaigning.

IMP.NERVA CAES.AVG.P.M.TR.P.COS.11 P.P. 
Rev. Fortune standing, holding rudder and cornucopiae. 
FORTVNA A VGVST. 
66 
A VGVST. is an abbreviation of the genitive A VGVSTI: the personification, 
and, therefore, the quality it represents, is attributed to the Emperor. Indeed, the 
Fortuna Augusti seems to have been regarded almost as equal to the emperor's genius, 
or guardian spirit. The coin suggests that, with Nerva in control, the ship of state is 
sailing a course of peace, prosperity and good government. The reverse type, like so 
many others of Nerva, was used by Galba (see RJC, Galba 140). "In several respects 
Nerva's accession may be said to resemble that of Galba. Both men were adopted by 
the Senate on account of their advanced age and generally discreet reputation as a 
palliative to the popular indignation aroused by their immediate predecessors. Nero and 
Domitian alike fell foul of the Senate and succeeded in stirring up violent hostility on 
the part of the more conservative party in Rome. Their reigns had been marked by 
reckless extravagance; and on their downfall it fell to the lot of their successors to 
devise a policy of retrenchment." (RJC, vol. 2, pp. 221-222) The coins of both give 
expression to this noble aim.

Rev. Hands clasped. 
CONCORDIA EXERCITVVM 
The portrait makes no attempt at idealisation, being almost cruelly frank. Lined 
brow, hollow cheeks and scrawny neck are strong evidence of frailty. There are signs, 
too, of gentleness and refinement. The portrait style is consistent throughout Nerva's 
comage. 
The reverse is a classic example of wishful thinking. "Harmony among the 
armies" was conspicuous by its absence during the crisis triggered by Nerva's refusal to 
67 
execute the murderers of Domitian, to whom the soldiers were devoted. Threatened 
with a general mutiny, Nerva tried to play off one legion against another. The problem 
was finally solved when Nerva adopted Trajan as his son and co-ruler in October, 97.

an altar. 
PONT.MAX.TR.POT.COS.11 
The patera was a broad, shallow dish used for sacrificial offerings. Strangely 
enough, it often appears on Roman coins not only in the hands of the worshipper, but 
transfen-ed to the deity or personification worshipped. The reverse proclaims that 
Trajan's reign is one of harmony and prosperity.

NERVA in the obverse legend is a reminder that Nerva adopted Trajan in 97, 
shortly before his death in January 98. He did so in order to placate the Praetorians and

The heads representing sun and moon are a reminder that astrology was a major 
preoccupation at this time. Aeternitas may be seen (a) as a blessing, suggesting that 
Trajan's house will endure forever; and (b) as an imperial virtue, with the implication 
that the Emperor is, in reality, a living god.

There is no direct historical reference. The reverse type bears a general 
character, suggesting justice and prosperity. Aequitas, however, was thought to operate 
70 
in certain well-defined areas, notably the supply of food to a ruler's subjects, and 
honesty and fair dealing in imperial government generally.

S.P.Q.R. OPTIMO PRINCIPI 
The high standard of monetary art under the Flavians declined somewhat under 
Trajan. His portraits tend to be unimaginative and dull. Obverse legends, as here, 
suffer from overcrowding. 
The reverse alludes directly to Trajan's most important military achievement, 
the conquest of Dacia. While the standard of campaigning was undoubtedly high, the 
wisdom of the enterprise has been seriously questioned through the centuries. Cf. on

CONGIARIVM TERTIVM S.C. 
The reverse celebrates Trajan's "third largess". Emperors came to rely more and 
more on the distribution of money or food to the populace, as a means of winning 
support for their rule. Consequently, Liberalitas became more and more pre-eminent as 
an imperial virtue. Her figure appears in distribution scenes on coins from Nero 
onwards.

The reverse symbolises Hadrian's return to Rome from his long tour of A.D. 
121-127. At this time there was an upsurge in his coinage, with a fine new portrait on a 
larger scale and new types. The obverse legend was shortened by the dropping of

The reverse legend, TELL VS ST ABIL[IT A], means "Earth stabilised". The

was eminently conducive to such peaceful and fruitful pursuits as agriculture.

AEGYPTOS 
The portrait is naturalistic, forceful and vigorous. Hadrian was deeply interested 
in his provinces, and visited them in two major tours ( 12 1- 127 and 128-13 1). His 
interest is reflected in a remarkable series of coins minted in the closing years of his 
reign, when his travels had finally ended. The provinces are depicted as female figures, 
in appropriate garb and with their individual attributes. In every instance, local 
character is evinced with great skill. Here Egypt is distinguished by her sacred bird, the 
ibis, the sistrum, or rattle, used by the Egyptians in their worship of Isis, and a basket 
containing native produce.

SALVS AVG. 
The reverse indicates that the Emperor was suffering from an illness, because of 
which sacred rites had apparently been performed for his recovery. This was Hadrian's 
last issue: he died 10 July, 1 38, with a whimsical address to his restless soul.

76 
Tradition has it that the marriage of Hadrian and Sabina was unhappy. This 
seems likely in the light of his liason with Antinous. It is possible then that the coins 
honouring Sabina were minted at the command of her adopted son, Antoninus Pius, 
after Hadrian's death in 138.

The obverse legend recalls that Antoninus was adopted by Hadrian on 25 
February, 138, and succeeded him on 10th July of the same year. He did not accept the 
title of Pater Patriae for himself until early in 139, after Hadrian had been deified. 
The Emperor's portrait on Antoninus' coins is generally competent, without 
being distinguished. Felicitas is one of Antoninus' commonest reverse types. It 
suggests that one of the concerns of the new ruler will be the material comfort and 
wellbeing of his subjects.

MA VRET ANIA COS.II S.C. 
When Antoninus Pius came to the throne, he was offered a series of accession 
presents, the aurum corollarium. Antoninus generously remitted half of the provinces' 
contribution and the whole of Italy's. The Emperor's series of coins on the provinces 
depicts them offering crowns of various shapes. They are also, of course, distinguished 
by one or the other of their particular attributes. The series does more than 
commemorate the occasion of the presentation. It also serves as a reminder of the 
selflessness of Antoninus, as well as providing a link with the province series of his 
illustrious predecessor Hadrian.

78 
Antoninus was grief-stricken at the death of his wife, the Elder Faustina, in A.D. 
14 1 at the age of thirty-six, and honoured her in his coinage to an extraordinary degree. 
The reverse type indicates the timeless world into which Faustina has passed. 
Other Faustina coins, depicting a variety of goddesses and virtues, signify the 
functions of Faustina in her new world. Her coin portraits, with their stately profiles 
and beautifully coiled hair, are quite outstanding. P01traits of the younger Faustina and 
Lucilla are of comparable quality ( coins 106 and 112).

Although we know little of the history of the years A.D. 140-144, the Victory

in Britain, probably not earlier than 143.

The younger Faustina, daughter of Antoninus Pius and wife of Marcus Aurelius, 
was declared Augusta after the birth of her first child in A.D. 1 46. She is honoured on 
the reverse of this coin for her fruitfulness. In all, she bore six daughters and six sons. 
Such numismatic honours are but one indication of Aurelius' affection and 
respect for Faustina. She accompanied him on his northern campaign (A.D. 170-174) 
and to the East, where she died in 175. In 174 she was proclaimed Mater Castrorum. 
On balance it would seem, therefore, that stories of her promiscuity in the Historia 
Augusta are improbable, and that the Pudicitia reverse types on her coinage can be 
accepted at their face value.

The reverse refers to the spirit of harmonius cooperation supposedly existing

and the voluptuous, impulsive Verus must have found themselves poles apart, and one

much relief.

Thus, this coin, minted by M. Aurelius in memory of his father, illustrates how the latter

The obverse portrait is remarkable for its elaborately curled hair and beard. The 
title Armeniacus commemorates the expulsion of the Parthians from Armenia early in 
163. It was little deserved by Verus, the nominal commander-in-chief, who spent his 
83 
energies riotously in Antioch and Daphne, while the fighting was prosecuted by Statius

85 
As the obverse legend is partly obliterated, dating is uncertain. SVBACTA, 
"tamed, subjugated, brought under", is a stronger word than the neutral uicta, 
"conquered, overcome". Waging war must have been distasteful to Aurelius, a scholar, 
philosopher and moralist. It is perhaps, therefore, one measure of his greatness that his 
campaigns were so successful. The portrait, compared with that of coin 109, shows 
signs of age and tiredness.

Julia Domna, second wife of Septimius Severns and mother of Caracalla, was 
honoured in a wide variety of coins, designed to reflect her virtues. In Hilaritas there is 
a probable reference to the cult of the Great Mother, Cybele: the influential Julia was 
the earthly counterpart of the mother of the gods.

PROFECTIO A VG. 
Caracalla's imperial name was Marcus Aurelius Antoninus. Caracalla was 
merely a nickname. It never appeared on his coins or public monuments. He added 
Pius from 201 and Britannicus from 2 10. 
87 
The obverse is a reminder that Caracalla campaigned in Britain with his father,

Julia Maesa was the grandmother of two emperors, Elagabalus and Severns 
Alexander. She won over the soldiers with largesses, proclaimed Elagabalus Emperor, 
fought at the head of his army against Macrinus, had a seat in the Senate, and shrewdly 
persuaded Elagabalus to adopt Alexander Severns as his successor. 
Most of her coins probably belong to the reign of Elagabalus.

The name Marcus Aurelius Antoninus, conferred on Elagabalus by his 
grandmother Julia Maesa, recalls a revered predecessor. In view of Elagabalus' bizarre 
criminality, the contrast between the two rulers is ironic. There is a similar irony in the 
lofty ideals propounded in the reverse. 
For differences between the coins of Elagabalus and those of Caracalla, who 
assumed the same name, see St. p. 356.

SPES PVBLICA 
The Emperor's hair and beard are beautifully engraved. Alexander's reverses 
typically lay less emphasis on his achievements than on deities and virtues. 
The personification of Spes (Hope) is common on Roman imperial coins, 
especially in the early stages of an emperor's reign. It indicates either the favourable 
expectations which his subjects entertained of him or the expectations which he himself 
wished to foster. 
As Spes was also a goddess of youth, her appearance on the coins of Alexander 
is particularly appropriate: he was Augustus from seventeen to thirty years of age. 
92 
The figure of Spes is strikingly similar to the Spes on another object in the 
Antiquities Museum, a Tunisian lamp of the second century AD.

Balbinus was declared Augustus jointly with Pupienus on 9 July, 238. He had

Despite threats from Maximinus, the Goths and the Persians, he proved a wise, 
disinterested and efficient rnler. But after three months he and his colleague were 
murdered by venal praetorians. 
The parazonium, a short, sheathed sword worn at the belt, is often shown as an 
attribute of the deity Virtus. It may, therefore, be taken here as a symbol of the 
Emperor's valour. 
The realistic portrait on the obverse 1s remarkably consistent throughout 
Balbin us' coinage.

The reverse legend almost certainly embodies the name of a nome, or regional

the nomes and a few other cities of Egypt, writes: 
A full examination is as yet impossible. No cabinet contains a 
good representative series, nor can such a series be made of the 
specimens of different cabinets. The difficulties of description 
are very great, since we are frequently uncertain of the 
personage represented. This is explained by the fact that the 
selection is Alexandrian, not local.

PROVINCIA DACIA AN.I 
When Philip I became Emperor in 244, he immediately made his son Caesar. In 
247 the boy, now ten, was proclaimed Augustus. From this time till their deaths two 
years later, the reverses of their coins bore similar types. 
Philip I put Dacia in his debt in 247 by making her a free province. Its 
inhabitants, thereby, were equal in all respects with Roman citizens. For AN.I ("year 
one") it appears that the Dacians began their dates using this event as a starting point. 
Similar coins have AN.II, AN.III, etc. 
As long as Dacia was subject to the Romans, her personification on coins was 
regularly depicted in a seated position before some trophy, as in coin 89. From the time 
of her emancipation, however, standing became her normal position. The cap on her 
96 
head is frequently identified as the pileus, or cap of libe1iy. The eagle, the symbol of 
the Roman Empire, is here adopted by Dacia, because she has been made Roman. The 
lion was the usual symbol of the province.

FIDES EXERCITVS 
Philip I was an Arab by birth, a man of amazing cunning and superior military 
gifts. Having risen through the ranks of the Roman army, he was proclaimed Emperor 
by the soldiers in A.D. 244. He tried to hold their loyalty with ample largesses and the 
establishment of colonies for discharged veterans. 
In the sixth year of his reign a rival, Trajan Decius, was declared Emperor by the 
army in Pannonia. Philip marched forth to deal with the situation and was killed, 
together with his twelve-year old son, Philip II. 
In retrospect, therefore, the reverse of the coin is sadly ironic and an example of 
wishful thinking. It is essentially a plea to the army not to break its oath of loyalty. But 
at this time the army was not so much a loyal servant as the de facto ruler of the Empire.

The eagle reverse is an unwitting tribute to the king-making power of the Roman

when rebel soldiers of the Moesian and Pannonian legions proclaimed him Emperor in 
A.D. 249. 
After a brief reign he too fell victim to treachery, that of Trebonianus Gallus, in

accompanied by the legend APOLLINI CONS[ERVATORIJ AVG., "to Apollo, 
protector of the Augustus". 
Sometimes the type was the accompanying mark of a legion, e.g. LEG.II

son, Salonius. Gallienus declared his son among the gods and gave up the struggle. 
While Postumus honoured many gods of the Roman pantheon on his coins as his 
companions or preservers, Hercules is mentioned more than any other. The reverse 
implies that Postumus achieved peace in Gaul through the help of Hercules, rather than 
the general turmoil of the Empire.

varied. After being defeated by the barbarians at Placentia, he avenged himself in three

Obverse and reverse give contrasting, almost contradictory impressions. The 
obverse image and legend are appropriate for so warlike and powerful a ruler. Probus 
devoted much of his reign to securing the frontiers against barbarians in Gaul, Germany, 
Egypt and Thrace. He celebrated a splendid triumph in Rome in 28 1. 
In 282 some troops proclaimed Cams, the Praetorian Prefect, as Emperor. The 
soldiers sent by Probus to deal with the trouble deserted to Cams, and Probus was 
murdered by others of his soldiers at Sirmium in the Danube region. The army had 
constantly been rebellious, owing apparently to Probus' harsh discipline and his use of 
troops to plant vineyards. The reverse then seems to be another instance of wishful 
thinking.

by lightning in late 283, and Numerianus, returning with his army to Europe, was found 
dead in his tent, whether from illness or foul play, near Heraclea in late 284. The

An excellent administrator, Diocletian was the first to paiiition the Empire into 
west and east, with two Augusti (A.D. 286) and two Caesars (A.D. 293). His aim was 
to protect himself, his associates and his successors from ever-increasing insurrection 
and violence. The scheme, which worked fairly well during his reign, fell to bits when 
he died.

No mintmark in exergue. 
Besides the gods, Roman religion admitted guardian spirits (genii), who presided 
over and inspired states, nations, families and individuals. 
The obverse is technically interesting for the manner in which textures of hair, 
beard, skin and metal are distinguished. The first two are markedly stylised. The head 
is elongated, the neck short. 
"Some coins of Maximianus Herculius show a nasal deformity resulting from a 
broken nose as well as facial features suggesting the loss of teeth. One wonders if they 
were the result of an accident or a combat injury." (G.D. Hart, "The Diagnosis of 
Disease from Ancient Coins", Archaeology 26 ( 1973), 123- 127). Hart's observations 
are pertinent here.

A crude imitation of the official Roman antoninianus. Such coins are usually 
called "barbarous radiates". In Britain most of the Roman imperial coinage between 
A.D. 258 and 296 was copied. Generally, the worse the imitation, the later it should be 
dated: most of the later imitations were copied not from the official coinage, but from 
copies themselves. The most compelling reason for the striking of "barbarous radiates" 
was the need for small change, in which the official coinage was sadly lacking. The 
subject is thoroughly discussed by P.V. Hill in CRB, Appendix II, pp. 83-86.

Galerius Maximian forced Diocletian and Maximian Herculius to abdicate in 
305, assumed the title of Augustus and reigned in their place. He founded the colony of 
Valeria in Illyria. 
The modius, properly a bushel measure, is a symbol of fertility in crops and a 
reminder of the ruler's liberality and providence in securing food and bestowing it on 
his subjects. There is a similar message in the patera and the cornucopiae.

The reverse type would have appealed to both Christians and non-Christians 
alike. The sun was worshipped by many ancient peoples, including Egyptians (they 
identified Osiris with the sun), Incas, Parthians (their kings were its "brothers"), Greeks 
(especially Rhodians; cf. on coin 4) and Romans. 
Christ also, by a syncretic process, was frequently associated with the sun. For 
example, a mosaic ceiling in the necropolis under St. Peter's Basilica, Rome, depicts 
Christ in the form of Helios, with golden rays emanating from his head, driving across 
the sky in a chariot.

Gloria depended on the recognition by others of a person's or a nation's great 
deeds. A preoccupation with gloria is present in Roman literature from the earliest 
fragments onwards. 
GLORIA as a coin legend appears for the first time on a coin of Probus (276-
282) and is repeated with great frequency on coins of the later Empire, e.g. GLORIA 
REIPVBLICAE, GLORIA EXERCITVS, GLORIA ORBIS, GLORIA 
ROMANORVM. The last was used for the first time, as a title of personal honour, by 
Constantine the Great. It was used also by his three sons and many of their successors. 
After the fall of the Roman Empire the formula was revived on a gold medallion 
of the Byzantine Emperor Justinian (527-565): it bore the reverse legend SALVS ET 
GLORIA ROMANORVM (illustrated in BIC, vol. 1, frontispiece).

In A.D. 335 Constantine the Younger was entrusted by his father with the 
government of Gaul, Britain and Spain. In the division of Empire which followed the 
death of Constantine I, Constantine II retained these provinces and received a part of 
Africa as well. Being dissatisfied with his territorial lot, he declared war against his 
brother Constans in 340, invaded Italy, fell into an ambush and was killed at Aquileia. 
So much for the sentiments of brotherly union expressed on the reverse.

When Constantine died in 337, Constantius II and his brothers, Constantine 
Junior and Constans, met at Constantinople and divided the Empire between them as 
Augusti. Their respective ages were twenty-one, twenty and seventeen. They were 
backed by the army, which declared that only Constantine's sons should reign. 
The reverse legend is common on silver and brass coins from the time of 
Constantius II, Constantine II and Constans as Augusti through the reign of Valentinian 
I, i.e. A.D. 337-375. 
On the reverse the tree curves with the edge of the coin. A similar technique is 
used on coins 183 and 184. 
After Constantine II was killed at Aquileia in A.D. 340, Constans was sole 
master of the West, as Constantius was of the East. Constans' war with the Franks in 
341 ended in an alliance and the return of the invaders to their homeland. He also 
126 
restored a degree of tranquillity and order to the important province of Britain. Such 
achievements justify the proud claim of the reverse legend (lit. ''successful restoration 
of the times"). 
The usurper Magnentius had Constans murdered in 350.

Julian the Apostate abandoned Christianity and restored the worship of pagan

Empire after the death of Constantius II the following year. He was killed at thirty-one 
while fighting the Persians. 
The engraving of the obverse is particularly fine. The reverse legend, translated 
and slightly expanded, means "With vows (i.e. for the preservation of the Emperor) 
made for five or more years and for many years besides, up to ten years". Julian's 
premature death meant that the hopes which informed the vows were unrealised.

Valentinian II, son of Valentinian I and Justina, was proclaimed Augustus after 
his father's death in A.D. 375, being five or six years of age. Valentinian and his 
brother Gratian, then about sixteen, divided the West between them, Valentinian taking 
Italy, Illyricum and Africa, and Gratian Gaul, Spain and Britain. As the former was so 
young, Gratian was really sovereign of the West. 
The usurper Magnus Maximus had Gratian murdered in 3 83 and subsequently 
drove Valentinian II and Justina from Italy. In 388 Theodosius I, Emperor of the East, 
defeated and killed Maximus and reinstated Valentinian as sole Emperor of the West.

The reverse is wholly appropriate for Theodosius, whose achievements did 
much to restore the fading glory of imperial Rome. They included several resounding 
victories over the Goths, victory over the usurpers Magnus Maximus (387) and 
Eugenius (394), restoration of Valentinian II as sole ruler of the West and a long-lived 
treaty with the Persians.

This remarkable record was marred by a single inglorious episode in A.D. 390: 
the massacre of over 7,000 inhabitants of Thessalonica as a reprisal for the murder of 
one of his lieutenants. For this Amrose, bishop of Milan, compelled Theodosius to do 
penance for a period of some eight months.
