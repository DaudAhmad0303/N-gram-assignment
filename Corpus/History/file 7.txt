Other finds at the site include this head , also made from quartzite , dating to around 650 BC . Quartzite is a particularly durable material , and is therefore difficult to carve . Excavation leader Dietrich Raue says they may have used quartzite for its color variations -- the statue of Psamtik moves from purple to pink to dark brown .

Story highlights
Ancient statue would have stood 26-ft tall
It depicted a 26th Dynasty pharaoh , Psamtik I
Archaeologists pieced together more than 6 , 000 fragments to reconstruct the colossus 
( CNN ) When a huge statue of a pharaoh was uncovered last year in Matariya , a working-class suburb of Cairo that was once the ancient city of Heliopolis , the press eagerly greeted it as a depiction of the great Ramses II , one of ancient Egypt ' s most famous rulers . 

To many it came as a disappointment when a tiny inscription found on the back pillar of the statue suggested it in fact belonged to Psamtik I , a lesser-known pharaoh who ruled six centuries later , from 664-610 BC . 
But archaeologists suggest this identity makes the find much rarer and even more exciting . After piecing together more than 6 , 000 fragments , the Egyptian-German mission in charge of the excavations has been able to calculate the original size of the colossus and produce a 3D reconstruction .

They can now confidently say that the statue of Psamtik I was 26 ft tall , and that he was depicted with his left arm held out in front of his body .  
 " Now we have the complete monument ,  " Dietrich Raue , who leads the Heliopolis mission with Aiman Ashmawy , tells CNN .  " We can be very sure that nothing has been reworked , and that it ' s a genuine piece of art of the 26th Dynasty .  "  
 ' Absolutely unique ' 
This comes as a surprise , he adds . The first royal colossi -- larger-than-life sculptures -- were produced in the 12th dynasty ( 1938-1756 BC )  , but the trend reached its height in the 19th , under Ramses II ( 1292-1190 BC )  . After Ramses , there was a steady decline in sculpture . 
That is what makes the quartzite colossus of Psamtik I so rare and so special .  " As a creation of the period , such a huge statue is absolutely unique so far ,  " says Marsha Hill , a curator and Egyptologist from New York ' s Metropolitan Museum of Art .

King of culture
Raue , of the University of Leipzig , goes even further , calling Psamtik the founder of the renaissance movement in Egypt , a cultural revival during which religion , art and architecture were restored . 
The statue ' s fragments were found at the site of a temple belonging to Ramses II , and it is thought to have stood just in front of a large pylon dedicated to him , suggesting Psamtik wanted to be associated with the great ruler .  
 " It ' s absolutely fascinating to see how he tries to make himself part of the greatest period of rule in Egypt ,  " he says . 
Plus , it stood in Heliopolis , the cultural and religious center of ancient Egypt , located on the northeast periphery of Cairo .  " Every king had to be present there ,  " says Raue .

The city served as a center of worship to the sun for more than 2 , 500 years . This could explain the unusual gesture in Psamtik ' s statue , Raue says , noting that the stretched out arm is rarely attested in ancient Egyptian sculpture . 
An intricate carving found on the back-pillar of the colossus reinforces this theory . It shows Psamtik I kneeling in front of the sun and creator god Atum , offering two vessels .

Mystery of destruction
The question still puzzling archaeologists is when and why the statue was destroyed . Raue gives two options : either it was dismantled under imperial Rome by early Christians , or by Muslim rulers in the 10th or 11th centuries , who might have reused the material for Cairo ' s fortifications .  
 " But , for sure , somebody didn ' t like him ,  " says Raue . They found evidence of mutilation on the statue , for instance chiseling around Psamtik ' s mouth , which could suggest someone was trying to silence him . 
Judging by the turbulent time Psamtik was living in , this would not be surprising . As Hill explains , the Egypt of the 8th and early-7th Centuries was fractured and full of political tensions between the Assyrian kingdom of northern Mesopotamia and the Kushite empire from Sudan .

Psamtik started as just one of many local rulers . It was only following an Assyrian invasion that drove out the Kushite rulers of Egypt , that Psamtik was appointed as pharaoh in 664 BC , founding its 26th dynasty . 
His clever negotiations kept him in power for more than 50 years , and he is credited with the reunification of Egypt .  " He did not rush to try to exert his authority over the whole country , but let a gradual shift of allegiances take place ,  " says Hill .  
 " On the one hand he pursued a wise policy ,  " she adds ,  " but perhaps as part of that policy and other priorities he did not pursue building projects everywhere that would leave his imprint .  " 
Perhaps this is the reason Psamtik could never claim as much fame as Ramses II . But this statue changes things , says Hill .  " It gives us a remarkably new perspective on a king we thought we knew .  " 
An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated the number of statue fragments that the archaeologists pieced together .
