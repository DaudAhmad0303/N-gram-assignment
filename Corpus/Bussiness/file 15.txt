New Delhi ( CNN Business ) Indian businesswoman Swati Daga first bought bitcoin in 2017 , when the cryptocurrency was trading well under $3 , 000 . Her decision to invest in digital currencies was met with wariness by her family , she recalls .  
 
 " The elders in my family told me not to throw my money away ,  " said Daga , who runs a food business near New Delhi . 
But the 33-year-old hasn ' t regretted her decision — bitcoin ' s value has increased 15 times since then — and she continues to invest as much as 10% of her savings in cryptocurrencies , including bitcoin and ethereum .  
 " I find stock markets boring ,  " she told CNN Business , adding that she enjoys the " thrill " and " recklessness " that comes with investing in volatile currencies . 
She is not the only one . 
India has seen a huge boom in cryptocurrency trading since the start of the pandemic , even though authorities in Asia ' s third largest economy have for years expressed concerns about digital currencies , and even flirted with banning them . Entrepreneurs in the industry told CNN Business that the country has the potential to become a crypto superpower , since it is one of the hottest internet markets in the world , with 750 million users , and hundreds of millions more yet to come online for the first time . 
India ranked second behind only Vietnam last year in a list of countries seeing the fastest growth in cryptocurrency adoption , according to a report published in October by blockchain data platform Chainalysis . 
While the government does not keep estimates of how many people trade cryptocurrencies , industry experts have suggested that the country may now have more than 20 million crypto investors . 
The growth is driven by younger investors — mostly under the age of 35 — and many of them are coming from smaller cities and towns , founders of two of India ' s biggest crypto exchanges told CNN Business . 
According to Sumit Gupta , CEO and co-founder of exchange CoinDCX , many Indian millennials have started " their investing journey with crypto .  " 
While 20 years ago , their parents chose to invest in gold , these youngsters " are more interested in having bitcoin as part of their portfolio ,  " Gupta told CNN Business , referring to the fact that traditionally Indians chose to park their money in gold or savings accounts . 
Buying gold is both an investment and a cultural habit in India , which is one of the largest markets for the precious metal , according to the World Gold Council . It also considered auspicious by Hindus and Jains , and plays a fundamental role in many religious ceremonies . 
Mumbai-based CoinDCX became India ' s first crypto unicorn last year , achieving a valuation of $1 . 1 billion after raising money from investors such as Coinbase Ventures and B Capital Group . The company says 70% of its 10 million users are between the age of 18 and 34 .

Data shared by rival firm WazirX tell a similar story . WazirX also has over 10 million users , and called 2021 a " phenomenal year " for crypto trading in India . The company was acquired by Binance , one of the world ' s biggest cryptocurrency exchanges , in 2019 . 
Over 65% of its users are under the age of 35 , according to a recent company report , and it has seen a " 700% increase in the number of participants from smaller cities like Guwahati , Karnal , Bareilly , thereby signaling the growing interest from rural and semi-urban areas .  " 
Pritish Kumawat , a crypto trader from a small town in the western state of Rajasthan , said that he now finds conversations about cryptocurrencies in almost every tea shop in his area . Often , the most engaged participants are college students , he said , adding that bitcoin ' s massive spike last year has fueled the frenzy in India . 
In November , bitcoin was trading at a record high of $68 , 990 , but it has since fallen to around $43 , 000 . In addition to bitcoin , meme currencies such as dogecoin and shiba inu are also popular among Indians , the WazirX report added . 
Apart from investors from smaller towns , both companies saw an increase of more than 1000% in the number of women users on their platforms , albeit on a small base . 
Gupta said that participation of crypto by Indian women has seen " a massive upside " in the past 18 months and is " fairly high , fairly healthy , relative to equity markets .  " 
The company ' s data shows that 15% of their overall users are women — which is the global trend as well . 
On-again , off-again relationship
The excitement over crypto is rising in India despite the country ' s on-again , off-again relationship with digital currencies . 
The central bank has long expressed concerns that cryptocurrencies can be used for money laundering and to finance terrorism . A cryptically worded proposal posted on the Indian parliament website last year even suggested the government was exploring plans to " prohibit all private cryptocurrencies in India .  " 
This year , however , started on a more cheerful note for enthusiasts . Earlier this month , the Indian government announced it would impose a 30% tax on income from virtual digital assets , which many industry experts took as a sign that crypto trading won ' t be banned after all . The government also said it would launch a digital rupee in the coming months .  
 " Taxation of virtual digital assets or crypto is a step in the right direction . It gives much-needed clarity and confidence to the industry ,  " Gupta said at the time of the announcement . 
Siddharth Menon , the co-founder of WazirX , told CNN Business that following the announcement , his platform saw daily sign-ups jump by over 50% . He also noticed rising interest among Indian developers and other professionals in joining the crypto industry .

 " I ' m getting LinkedIn messages " from senior executives in India , who are now more optimistic about the business , he said . In the past , Indian exchanges have struggled to hire and retain experienced people due to the lack of clear regulations . 
But the Indian government soon put a damper on the mood , by clarifying that the cryptocurrencies are not yet legal in the country .  
 " I am not doing anything to legalize it or ban it or not legalize it ,  " Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said in parliament a few days after announcing the tax rate .  " Banning or not banning will come subsequently .  .  . But I will tax because it is a sovereign right .  "  
 " I think the government is not entirely sure what it wants to do from a policy perspective ,  " said Anirudh Rastogi , founder of tech law firm Ikigaw Law , which works with crypto exchanges in India .  
 " It knows where it wants to land broadly . It wants to find the right balance where it is not disconnected from the global progress in blockchain and other tech , but it wants to also address concerns regarding cryptocurrency .  " 
Rastogi added that the " extraordinarily high " tax on crypto is a short-term fix , which will also acts as a deterrent to many investors .  
 " This rate is typically used to tax activities that are not considered economically productive , such as lottery ,  " he said .  " So this could be an indication that the government wants to make revenue , but it does not see crypto trading as economically productive .  " 
For equities , India applies a 15% short-term capital gains tax if shares are sold in less than a year , and 10% if sold after a year . 
Gupta hopes that the government makes up its mind soon . India , with its vast pool of developers and enthusiastic young population , could be a " superpower in the next five to 10 years ,  " in cryptocurrency and blockchain industry , he said .  
 " What is missing right now is a clear regulatory framework ,  " he added .
