New York ( CNN Business ) A single share of Amazon and Google owner Alphabet each trades at nearly $3 , 000 -- a pretty high price for average investors . But that will soon change : The companies will split their shares , reducing their stock prices sharply , in the next few months . 

Could other high-priced blue chip stocks , such as Booking Holdings , Chipotle and AutoZone , follow Amazon and Google ' s lead ? 
The stock-split candidates
Online travel giant Booking Holdings ( BKNG ) has a sky-high stock price , with one share costing more than $2 , 000 . The company has never done a normal stock split to lower its share price ; in fact , it has done a more unusual reverse stock split to boost its price . 
In 2003 , when Booking was still known as Priceline , the company reduced the number of shares outstanding to push its price higher . At the time , Priceline shares were in free fall as a result of the dot-com meltdown . Some traders even worried the stock could get delisted . 
Booking was not immediately available for comment about a potential stock split . 
Two other well-known stocks in the S & P 500 are trading for more than $1 , 000 as well . 
AutoZone ' s ( AZO ) stock price is currently around $1 , 900 The company has split its stock before , but that was back in 1994 . AutoZone was not available for comment . 
And then there ' s Chipotle ( CMG )  . The fast casual dining giant ' s shares trade for more than $1 , 500 . The stock has never split since its initial public offering in 2006 . Chipotle also was not available for comment . 
Why companies split stocks
On the surface , stock splits seem pointless : When companies split their stock , it doesn ' t change the market value of the firm . They ' re just increasing the number of shares , which lowers their stock price . 
What ' s more , several brokerages offer traders a way to buy fractional shares , small pieces of one stock . 
So why do companies split stocks ? 
Many investors prefer to own a full share of a company instead of a little chunk of it in order to get a vote in annual shareholder meetings . Stock splits also send a psychological message to the market , because average investors often perceive stocks to be more affordable after a split and buy even more . 
Apple ' s ( AAPL ) stock is up about 65% since it announced its last stock split in July 2020 , for example . Tesla ( TSLA ) shares have soared more than 200% since it approved a stock split in August 2020 . 
Amazon and Alphabet could give the Dow a 21st century facelift

One share of Tesla now costs about $810 , making it the eighth-priciest stock in the S & P 500 . Tesla was not immediately available for comment when asked if the company was considering another split . 
Amazon ( AMZN ) and Alphabet ( GOOGL ) arguably needed to split their stocks since they have the second- and third-priciest shares in the S & P 500 . Lowering the price also increases the chances that the two tech giants may get added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average , which weights its holdings by stock price . 
Some companies never split
The most expensive stock in the S & P 500 is home builder NVR ( NVR )  . A solitary NVR share costs nearly $4 , 800 . 
NVR has never split its stock , so investors shouldn ' t hold their breath to wait for a split . NVR is like the class A stock of Warren Buffett ' s Berkshire Hathaway ( BRKA )  , which famously has never . A single share costs nearly half a million dollars . 
Berkshire does have " cheaper " B shares though . They split in 2010 when Berkshire bought the Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad . One Berkshire B share ( BRKB ) trades for just $330 . That stock is in the S & P 500 .
