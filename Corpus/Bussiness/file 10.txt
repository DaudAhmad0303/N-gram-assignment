( CNN Business ) As technology continues to revolutionize the way people live , work and spend , central banks around the globe have kicked off efforts to reinvent their local currencies for the digital era . Now , the United States is the latest to signal " urgency " in researching a potential digital version of its dollar via a Central Bank Digital Currency , or CBDC . 

Part of President Joe Biden ' s executive order regarding digital assets on Wednesday includes " placing urgency on research and development of a potential United States CBDC , should issuance be deemed in the national interest ,  " according to an accompanying fact sheet released by the White House . 
China , the world ' s second-largest economy by gross domestic product , soft-launched its digital renminbi in January and the CBDC already boasts more than a hundred million users . All told , around 100 countries are exploring CBDCs at one level or another , International Monetary Fund managing director Kristalina Georgieva said during remarks at the Atlantic Council think tank last month .  
 " We have moved beyond conceptual discussions of CBDCs and we are now in the phase of experimentation ,  " Georgieva said .  " Central banks are rolling up their sleeves and familiarizing themselves with the bits and bytes of digital money .  " 
David Yermack , the finance department chair at New York University ' s Stern School of Business , told CNN Business that it is now " inevitable the entire world will be issuing money in this way .  " In the United States , the pandemic propelled demand for cashless payment methods and many Main Street investors have embraced cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum , putting pressure on the government not to fall behind on the trend . 
With the Biden administration now throwing new weight behind innovating Americans ' money , here ' s what to know about a potential CBDC . 
What is a Central Bank Digital Currency and how would it work ? 
The Federal Reserve defines CBDCs as " a digital form of central bank money that is widely available to the general public .  " A key difference from current forms of digital cash in a bank account or payment app is that the money would be a liability of the Fed and not commercial banks — hence the " central bank money .  " This means it would be an actual US dollar in digital form , not an investment in a cryptocurrency or a holding in your PayPal . 
There are differing opinions on how this would work and what it would look like , but in theory it could alleviate the need for third-party processors when transferring money .  
 " At a very high level , a CBDC is just digital money that would be issued by the central bank ,  " Sarah Hammer , the managing director of the Stevens Center for Innovation in Finance at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania , told CNN Business .  " It would be based on the fiat currency of that country , so it would be based on the money supply — and then it would be implemented using a government database or approved private sector entities working with the government .  " 
Yermack , who has been studying the rise of digital currencies for years , added that a CBDC " would actually operate an awful lot like Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies .  "  
 " You ' d have a network of wallets , probably held by members of the public , where people could pay each other directly without going through a third party ,  " Yermack said . 
A significant tech decision for policymakers , according to Hammer , is whether a US central bank digital currency runs on a blockchain , the technology underpinning cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin , as it would throw federal government weight behind this emerging tech .  
 " It can be operated through a central database , or through distributed ledger technology , the blockchain ,  " Hammer said . 
The Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology published joint research last month on a CBDC experiment dubbed " Project Hamilton .  " The work used blockchain technology and " produced one code base capable of handling 1 . 7 million transactions per second ,  " per a statement from the Boston Fed . This was far above the benchmark of 100 , 000 transactions per second the researchers initially sought out to achieve . The statement added that Project Hamilton " focuses on technological experimentation and does not aim to create a usable CBDC for the United States .  " 
Yermack , however , said it is " likely that whatever they ' re working on is going to be what the Fed grabs onto and tries to scale up .  " 
China ' s digital yuan , however , notably does not operate on blockchain tech . The digital yuan aims to replace cash payments and can be accessed through a government-backed mobile app as well as Tencent ' s WeChat . It uses existing tech infrastructure used by approved Chinese commercial and online banks and payment platforms , and is issued by the People ' s Bank of China . 
What are the potential benefits and risks ? 
A CBDC could potentially offer consumers a more convenient , safer and cheaper alternative to the options available currently . It could also alleviate the need for cash and crackdown on fraudulent transactions , according to Hammer , as well as make it more efficient for collecting taxes or dispersing targeted government funds .  
 " There are some financial inclusion benefits of having a central bank digital currency ,  " she added , touting their ability to reach Americans that don ' t have bank accounts . 
There are several potential risks , including tech barriers and security concerns as well as privacy threats , Yermack noted . Its potential to take on some of the work performed by commercial banks and credit markets has also caused some to worry . 
The Fed warned specifically of potential cybersecurity risks in a January report , saying ,  " Any dedicated infrastructure for a CBDC would need to be extremely resilient to such threats , and the operators of the CBDC infrastructure would need to remain vigilant as bad actors employ ever more sophisticated methods and tactics .  " 
Moreover , a CBDC could potentially threaten the independence of the Fed and raise a slew of new policy questions .  
 " The risk of political abuse is huge ,  " Yermack said .  " If you give the central bank this kind of power , the political safeguards would probably need to be much higher than currently in place for the Federal Reserve .  " 
While Yermack says a CBDC will likely call for some " thoughtful political redesign " and a transition period as nations experiment with it over the next decade , he still sees " many good reasons to do this .  "  
 " Throw in the fact that people really don ' t like using cash — the preferences of the public are pushing governments in this direction as well ,  " Yermack said .
