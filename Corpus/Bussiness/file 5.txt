 ' I know the truth '  : CNN asks Russians what they think about Putin ' s war
Kyiv , Ukraine ( CNN ) Award-winning American journalist Brent Renaud was killed by Russian forces in the Ukrainian city of Irpin , police in Kyiv said in social media posts on Sunday . Another American journalist , Juan Arredondo , was wounded . 

In a tweet , Kyiv region police identified the dead man as Renaud , who was 50 . Police posted a photo of his body and his American passport as evidence , as well as a photo of an outdated New York Times press badge with Renaud ' s name . 
Andriy Nebitov , the head of the Kyiv region police , said in a Facebook post that Russian forces shot Renaud , adding that " the occupants cynically kill even journalists of international media , who ' ve been trying to tell the truth about atrocities of Russian military in Ukraine .  "  
 " Of course , journalism carries risks , but the US citizen Brent Renaud paid with his life for an attempt to shed light on how underhand , cruel , and merciless the aggressor is ,  " Nebitov added . 
CNN has not independently verified the account given by police . 
Renaud is the first foreign journalist known to be killed in the war in Ukraine . A Ukrainian camera operator , Yevhenii Sakun , was reportedly killed when Kyiv ' s TV tower was shelled earlier this month . 
Press freedom groups denounced Sunday ' s violence as a violation of international law .  
 " Russian forces in Ukraine must stop all violence against journalists and other civilians at once , and whoever killed Renaud should be held to account ,  " the Committee to Protect Journalists said in a statement . 
Time magazine told CNN that Renaud , an acclaimed filmmaker , was in Ukraine in recent weeks to work on " a Time Studios project focused on the global refugee crisis .  "  
 " Our hearts are with all of Brent ' s loved ones ,  " the publication said .  " It is essential that journalists are able to safely cover this ongoing invasion and humanitarian crisis in Ukraine .  " 
Arredondo , a Colombian-American photographer , appeared in a social media video from Okhmatdyt hospital in Kyiv and recounted the shooting . He said he and Renaud were driving through a checkpoint in Irpin on the way to film refugees leaving the city when Russian forces opened fire . 
Arredondo said there were " two of us ,  " and Renaud was " shot and left behind ,  " adding that Renaud was shot in the neck .  " We got split and I got pulled into the ( stretcher )  .  " Asked how he got to the hospital , he replied ,  " an ambulance , I don ' t know .  " 
Arredondo , a filmmaker and visual journalist who is also an adjunct professor at Columbia Journalism School , posted photos from Zhytomyr , Ukraine , on Saturday , noting in an Instagram post that he is "  # onassignment .  " 
The Dean of Columbia Journalism School , Steve Coll , told CNN :  " We don ' t have any independent information about his injuries at this time but are working now to learn more and to see if we can help .  " 
Arredondo is a prominent photographer , with work featured in The New York Times , National Geographic , The Wall Street Journal , Newsweek , ESPN , Vanity Fair and other media outlets , according to his personal website bio . 
Anton Gerashchenko , an adviser to Ukraine ' s interior minister , said in a statement on Telegram that Renaud " paid with his life for attempting to expose the insidiousness , cruelty and ruthlessness of the aggressor .  " 
Irpin , in northern Ukraine just outside Kyiv , has been the site of substantial Russian shelling in recent days and has seen extensive destruction , according to the Kyiv regional government on Friday .

Ann Marie Lipinski , the director of the Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard , said the foundation was " heartsick " over the death of the journalist , who was a 2019 Harvard Nieman Fellow .  
 " Our Nieman Fellow Brent Renaud was gifted and kind , and his work was infused with humanity . He was killed today outside Kiev , and the world and journalism are lesser for it . We are heartsick ,  " she said in a tweet . 
A post on the Renaud Brothers Facebook page , dated March 8 , urged readers to follow their coverage of the war Ukraine . 
Christof Putzel , a friend and colleague of Renaud , told CNN his death was a " devastating " loss .  
 " I woke up this morning to the news that Brent , long-time best friend , incredible colleague , the best war journalist I think ever existed , finding out about his passing ,  " Putzel said on CNN ' s " Reliable Sources .  "  
 " Brent had this ability to go anywhere , get any story , listen and communicate what was happening to people that others wouldn ' t otherwise see it . And it is a devastating loss to journalism today ,  " he added . 
Putzel said Renaud was working on a documentary about refugees around the world when the crisis in Ukraine began . He said that " Brent was on the plane the next day " and covered the plight of refugees from Kyiv into Poland . 
Several years ago , the pair won a duPont award for a story they worked on about guns being smuggled into Mexico from the United States .  
 " What I said when we accepted our award was , the only thing bigger than Brent ' s balls are his heart . And I stand by that . That ' s what kind of journalist he was ,  " said Putzel . 
Renaud had a unique ability to make people trust him as he told their stories in places like Iraq and other war zones , he added .  
 " You could sit down and spend a week watching all of Brent ' s stories over the years back-to-back and just be flabbergasted ,  " Putzel said .  " The career that he had , his ability to reach people , his ability to capture the humanity behind people ' s suffering is something I have never seen before , and I was just honored to work with him as long as I did .
