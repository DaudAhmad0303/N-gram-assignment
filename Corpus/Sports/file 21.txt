It ’ s a wrap
Thankyou for joining us on that historic journey . Senegal are champions of Africa . And a decisive kick from that man Mane sealed the deal . 


The wait has finally ended 
 “ What a relief for Aliou Cisse , the most criticised coach in the world , according to Mane , standing right in front of the celebrating Senegalese fans . Clad in the Senegalese colours , the emotional coach is taking in all the adoration and love ,  ” adds Oluwashina from Olembe Stadium , witnessing history himself .

Possession , shots on goal , tackles , nothing matters when the clock goes past the 120th minute . 

Egypt were the Pharaohs of extra-time in the knockouts this year and Gabaski held firm in between the posts right from the start . 


But Senegal found the net when it mattered . And Salah didn ’ t even get around to taking his penalty . 

Loud noise as Mane , holding the Senegalese flag , is running around the track to celebrate with the fans who witness this moment for the first time in the country ’ s history . 


SENEGAL WIN AFRICA CUP OF NATIONS ! 
Sadio Mane ! That man ! Misses a penalty in the seventh minute , converts a penalty after the 120th . 

Senegal are African champions for the first time after losing two finals . 

Egypt ’ s wait for a record-extending eighth crown continues .

Senegal ⚽ ⚽ ❌ ⚽ ⚽

Egypt ⚽ ❌ ⚽ ❌

The lists are ready , the players know what ’ s at stake . 

Hold on , here we go . 

And we ’ re going to penalties . 

Didn ’ t seem like we ’ d still be here when Senegal were awarded a penalty in the fifth minute but here we are . 


🕛 116 mins

And the action moves to the other end where Mendy matches Gabaski in making an excellent save ! 

You ’ re left wondering where all those shooting boots were in normal time . 

Senegal 0-0 Egypt 




🕛 115 mins

Probably the best chance of the last half hour or so . Dieng fires it in and , well , Gabaski blocks it yet again ! 

Senegal 0-0 Egypt

🕛 110 mins

Into the final 10 . Egypt support gathering pace in the stands as the 11 on the field seem to be picking up a gear . 

Getting warmed up for the penalties ? 

Senegal 0-0 Egypt

🕛 105 mins

Half-time in extra-time . What will the next 15 bring ? A goal or the ref ’ s whistle to announce penalty kicks ? 

Tired legs , tired minds , tired fingers ( mine )  . Something has to give . 

Btw , no extra-time winner in an AFCON final since 1965 . 

In the stands , Senegal fans continue to sing and dance , hoping for a late goal . But Egypt fans are very quiet , happy to wait for penalties . 

Senegal 0-0 Egypt 




🕛 100 mins

Gabaski . Saves . Again . 

Egypt ’ s keeper keeps the tie level after flying to the left corner to keep Dieng ’ s attempt out . 

Senegal 0-0 Egypt 




🕛 91 mins

Gabaski again ! That man . Seemed a routine save but it ’ s nothing like that in extra-time in a final . 

Senegal 0-0 Egypt

Back underway for another 30 . 

Here we go .  
 
 “ One Senegal supporter , Haller Delan , just told me ‘ We believe God will help us ’  ,  ” as Senegal and Egypt head into extra 30 minutes . I understand many here are supporting Senegal partly because Egypt eliminated Cameroon in the semis ,  ” Daniel chips in with a bite-sized input as we all get settled into our chairs again . 


🕛 Extra-time it is

A total of seven shots on target ( Senegal 5 , Egypt 2 ) but none made it past the keepers . Senegal missed a penalty and fired several free-kicks over the bar . 

Egypt will be happy with what ’ s going on . Their fourth consecutive extra-time appearance at AFCON this year . And they won the last three to seal their spot in the final . 

Senegal 0-0 Egypt

🕛 90 mins

Fourth official says three minutes of injury time . 

Senegal 0-0 Egypt

With three out of three extra-time / penalties wins , Egypt supporters are loving this .

Spectacular attempt by Dieng to put Senegal ahead but it flies way , way , way over the goal ( again )  . 

Into the final five .

🕛 81 mins

The answer is no . The free-kick sails over the goal and now Egypt ’ s hero of the final so far , Gabanski , is down .

🕛 79 mins

Senegal have yet another free-kick just outside the box . 

Mane ’ s tripped by Fathy ( who is on a yellow )  . Will Senegal make this count ? 

Senegal 0-0 Egypt

🕛 70 mins

Twenty minutes left . Will Egypt go to yet another extra-time at this year ’ s AFCON ( all three of their knockouts have gone to ET )  ? 

Senegal still doing well on the possession chart ( 52% ) but they need a goal from somewhere to become champions of Africa for the first time .  
 
 “ As the frustrating sound of Senegalese fans fade away , the Egyptian fans are coming alive . They ’ ve travelled in large numbers to Yaounde for this game… now we can finally hear the drums from across the Cairo section of the stadium ,  ” reports Oluwashina from Olembe Stadium . 

Senegal 0-0 Egypt

🕛 54 mins

🟨 Diallo gets a yellow for a foul on Salah just moments after Gabanski makes another wonderful save denying Diedhiou after a cross from , you guessed it , Sarr . 


Give Mane another 45
Our other man Daniel has been hanging out with some football fans in the capital Yaounde .  
 
 “ In this drinking spot , I have spoken to many fans who are rooting for Senegal . Despite Mane missing a penalty in the first half , Vincent , a football fan , believes the Senegalese will score in the final .  .  ‘ Mane is a great player , let ’ s give him the second 45 minutes ’  .  ”

And it ’ s sailed way over the goal .

Second half underway
Right then , here ’ s to the next 45 minutes . 

More penalties ? I don ’ t know . More yellow cards ? Probably . A goal ? I hope so .  
 
 “ Senegal fans to my right are nervous . Intense half-time discussion . A lady clad in the colours of the West African nation says in French ‘ I am worried about the misses but I know Sadio can make up for the penalty miss in the second half ’  .  ” Our man Oluwashina is keeping his eyes on the pitch and ears on Senegalese fans . 

Senegal 0-0 Egypt

🕛 Half-time

So no early whistles ( yet ) in the AFCON final . It ’ s half-time and Mane ’ s missed penalty very , very early in the game will be the talking point during those half-time discussions all of you will be having . It could also be the ref offering his whistle to Salah . 

Three shots on target for Senegal , two for Egypt .

Oluwashina , the Africa football expert at the Olembe Stadium , chips in with this :  
 
 “ The half-hour mark : Senegal creating all the chances . Fit-again Watford man Ismaila Sarr probing on the right . His dangerous crosses across goal not met by any Teranga Lion .  ” 

Senegal 0-0 Egypt

🕛 28 mins

Salah has a first shot on target .  . in the 28th minute . Egypt has had 43% of possession and need him to be more involved . 

Don ’ t forget , the Liverpool man ( one of them ) has been involved in three of Egypt ’ s four goals at this tournament . 

🕛 22 mins

Senegal on top , Egypt hanging on . 

Ismaila Sarr is making his presence felt on the pitch . But are expectations taking a toll on Mane ?

Our man Oluwashina at the ground says “ Senegal ’ s goal-keeper Mendy is out for his warm-up and he ’ s got the fans out of their seats . Clearly the home fans are all for Senegal . After Egypt knocked Cameroon out in the semis , it ’ s clear who they are supporting today .  ” 

6 Feb 2022 - 18 : 06 GMT

Reminder : Both these sides lost the last time they were in an AFCON final .

Oluwashina is seated comfortably inside Olembe Stadium and is , umm , enjoying the view .  
 
 “ Police , firefighters , naval and airforce officers , the army , Gendarmeries , national guard , and others… they ’ ve been standing there for three hours ,  ” he says . 

Mind you , he had to walk four miles to get to the stadium .  
 
 “ Closure of roads six hours before kick-off with police lining up the streets ,  ” he adds . 

Still more than 90 minutes until kick-off .

Route to the final
Neither side came out all guns blazing at the start of the tournament . 

Egypt managed just two goals in their three group matches , edging out Guinea-Bissau and Sudan with 1-0 scorelines after losing their tournament opener 1-0 to Nigeria . 

Senegal had two stalemates against Guinea and Malawi that followed a 1-0 win over Zimbabwe in the opener . 

But both sides picked up pace from there on .

What you need to know about the AFCON final
Egypt will be looking for a record-extending eighth AFCON title . Senegal will be looking to go one better after losing the 2019 final to Algeria . 

The final will also see one of world football ’ s most exciting attacking duos facing off against each other as Mohamed Salah leads Egypt against a Senegal side spearheaded by Sadio Mane . 

The match is being played at Yaounde ’ s Olembe Stadium , where eight people were killed in a crush on January 25 – a tragedy that has overshadowed the tournament in Cameroon .
