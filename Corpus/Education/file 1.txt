I COME FROM a country which was created at midnight . When I almost died it was just after midday . 
One year ago I left my home for school and never returned . I was shot by a Taliban bullet and was
flown out of Pakistan unconscious . Some people say I will never return home but I believe firmly in
my heart that I will . To be torn from the country that you love is not something to wish on anyone . 
Now , every morning when I open my eyes , I long to see my old room full of my things , my clothes
all over the floor and my school prizes on the shelves . Instead I am in a country which is five hours
behind my beloved homeland Pakistan and my home in the Swat Valley . But my country is centuries
behind this one . Here there is any convenience you can imagine . Water running from every tap , hot or
cold as you wish ; lights at the flick of a switch , day and night , no need for oil lamps ; ovens to cook on
that don ’ t need anyone to go and fetch gas cylinders from the bazaar . Here everything is so modern
one can even find food ready cooked in packets . 
When I stand in front of my window and look out , I see tall buildings , long roads full of vehicles
moving in orderly lines , neat green hedges and lawns , and tidy pavements to walk on . I close my eyes
and for a moment I am back in my valley – the high snow-topped mountains , green waving fields
and fresh blue rivers – and my heart smiles when it looks at the people of Swat . My mind transports
me back to my school and there I am reunited with my friends and teachers . I meet my best friend
Moniba and we sit together , talking and joking as if I had never left . 
Then I remember I am in Birmingham , England . 
The day when everything changed was Tuesday , 9 October 2012 . It wasn ’ t the best of days to start
with as it was the middle of school exams , though as a bookish girl I didn ’ t mind them as much as
some of my classmates . 
That morning we arrived in the narrow mud lane off Haji Baba Road in our usual procession of
brightly painted rickshaws , sputtering diesel fumes , each one crammed with five or six girls . Since
the time of the Taliban our school has had no sign and the ornamented brass door in a white wall
across from the woodcutter ’ s yard gives no hint of what lies beyond . 
For us girls that doorway was like a magical entrance to our own special world . As we skipped
through , we cast off our head-scarves like winds puffing away clouds to make way for the sun then
ran helter-skelter up the steps . At the top of the steps was an open courtyard with doors to all the
classrooms . We dumped our backpacks in our rooms then gathered for morning assembly under the
sky , our backs to the mountains as we stood to attention . One girl commanded ,  ‘ Assaan bash !  ’ or
 ‘ Stand at ease !  ’ and we clicked our heels and responded ,  ‘ Allah .  ’ Then she said ,  ‘ Hoo she yar !  ’ or
 ‘ Attention !  ’ and we clicked our heels again .  ‘ Allah .  ’ 
The school was founded by my father before I was born , and on the wall above us KHUSHAL
SCHOOL was painted proudly in red and white letters . We went to school six mornings a week and as
a fifteen-year-old in Year 9 my classes were spent chanting chemical equations or studying Urdu
grammar ; writing stories in English with morals like ‘ Haste makes waste ’ or drawing diagrams of
blood circulation – most of my classmates wanted to be doctors . It ’ s hard to imagine that anyone
would see that as a threat . Yet , outside the door to the school lay not only the noise and craziness of
Mingora , the main city of Swat , but also those like the Taliban who think girls should not go to
school . 
That morning had begun like any other , though a little later than usual . It was exam time so school
started at nine instead of eight , which was good as I don ’ t like getting up and can sleep through the
crows of the cocks and the prayer calls of the muezzin . First my father would try to rouse me .  ‘ Time
to get up , Jani mun ,  ’ he would say . This means ‘ soulmate ’ in Persian , and he always called me that at
the start of the day .  ‘ A few more minutes , Aba , please ,  ’ I ’ d beg , then burrow deeper under the quilt . 
Then my mother would come .  ‘ Pisho ,  ’ she would call . This means ‘ cat ’ and is her name for me . At
this point I ’ d realise the time and shout ,  ‘ Bhabi , I ’ m late !  ’ In our culture , every man is your ‘ brother ’ 
and every woman your ‘ sister ’  . That ’ s how we think of each other . When my father first brought his
wife to school , all the teachers referred to her as ‘ my brother ’ s wife ’ or Bhabi . That ’ s how it stayed
from then on . We all call her Bhabi now . 
I slept in the long room at the front of our house , and the only furniture was a bed and a cabinet
which I had bought with some of the money I had been given as an award for campaigning for peace
in our valley and the right for girls to go to school . On some shelves were all the gold-coloured
plastic cups and trophies I had won for coming first in my class . Only twice had I not come top – both
times when I was beaten by my class rival Malka e-Noor . I was determined it would not happen
again . 
The school was not far from my home and I used to walk , but since the start of last year I had been
going with other girls in a rickshaw and coming home by bus . It was a journey of just five minutes
along the stinky stream , past the giant billboard for Dr Humayun ’ s Hair Transplant Institute where we
joked that one of our bald male teachers must have gone when he suddenly started to sprout hair . I
liked the bus because I didn ’ t get as sweaty as when I walked , and I could chat with my friends and
gossip with Usman Ali , the driver , who we called Bhai Jan , or ‘ Brother ’  . He made us all laugh with
his crazy stories . 
I had started taking the bus because my mother was scared of me walking on my own . We had been
getting threats all year . Some were in the newspapers , some were notes or messages passed on by
people . My mother was worried about me , but the Taliban had never come for a girl and I was more
concerned they would target my father as he was always speaking out against them . His close friend
and fellow campaigner Zahid Khan had been shot in the face in August on his way to prayers and I
knew everyone was telling my father ,  ‘ Take care , you ’ ll be next .  ’ 
Our street could not be reached by car , so coming home I would get off the bus on the road below
by the stream and go through a barred iron gate and up a flight of steps . I thought if anyone attacked me
it would be on those steps . Like my father I ’ ve always been a daydreamer , and sometimes in lessons
my mind would drift and I ’ d imagine that on the way home a terrorist might jump out and shoot me on
those steps . I wondered what I would do . Maybe I ’ d take off my shoes and hit him , but then I ’ d think if
I did that there would be no difference between me and a terrorist . It would be better to plead ,  ‘ OK , 
shoot me , but first listen to me . What you are doing is wrong . I ’ m not against you personally , I just
want every girl to go to school .  ’ 
I wasn ’ t scared but I had started making sure the gate was locked at night and asking God what
happens when you die . I told my best friend Moniba everything . We ’ d lived on the same street when
we were little and been friends since primary school and we shared everything , Justin Bieber songs
and Twilight movies , the best face-lightening creams . Her dream was to be a fashion designer
although she knew her family would never agree to it , so she told everyone she wanted to be a doctor . 
It ’ s hard for girls in our society to be anything other than teachers or doctors if they can work at all . I
was different – I never hid my desire when I changed from wanting to be a doctor to wanting to be an
inventor or a politician . Moniba always knew if something was wrong .  ‘ Don ’ t worry ,  ’ I told her . 
 ‘ The Taliban have never come for a small girl .  ’ 
When our bus was called , we ran down the steps . The other girls all covered their heads before
emerging from the door and climbing up into the back . The bus was actually what we call a dyna , a
white Toyota TownAce truck with three parallel benches , one along either side and one in the middle . 
It was cramped with twenty girls and three teachers . I was sitting on the left between Moniba and a
girl from the year below called Shazia Ramzan , holding our exam folders to our chests and our school
bags under our feet . 
After that it is all a bit hazy . I remember that inside the dyna it was hot and sticky . The cooler days
were late coming and only the faraway mountains of the Hindu Kush had a frosting of snow . The back
where we sat had no windows , just thick plastic sheeting at the sides which flapped and was too
yellowed and dusty to see through . All we could see was a little stamp of open sky out of the back and
glimpses of the sun , at that time of day a yellow orb floating in the dust that streamed over everything . 
I remember that the bus turned right off the main road at the army checkpoint as always and rounded
the corner past the deserted cricket ground . I don ’ t remember any more . 
In my dreams about the shooting my father is also in the bus and he is shot with me , and then there
are men everywhere and I am searching for my father . 
In reality what happened was we suddenly stopped . On our left was the tomb of Sher Mohammad
Khan , the finance minister of the first ruler of Swat , all overgrown with grass , and on our right the
snack factory . We must have been less than 200 metres from the checkpoint . 
We couldn ’ t see in front , but a young bearded man in light-coloured clothes had stepped into the
road and waved the van down . 
 ‘ Is this the Khushal School bus ?  ’ he asked our driver . Usman Bhai Jan thought this was a stupid
question as the name was painted on the side .  ‘ Yes ,  ’ he said . 
 ‘ I need information about some children ,  ’ said the man . 
 ‘ You should go to the office ,  ’ said Usman Bhai Jan . 
As he was speaking another young man in white approached the back of the van .  ‘ Look , it ’ s one of
those journalists coming to ask for an interview ,  ’ said Moniba . Since I ’ d started speaking at events
with my father to campaign for girls ’ education and against those like the Taliban who want to hide us
away , journalists often came , even foreigners , though not like this in the road . 
The man was wearing a peaked cap and had a handkerchief over his nose and mouth as if he had
flu . He looked like a college student . Then he swung himself onto the tailboard at the back and leaned
in right over us . 
 ‘ Who is Malala ?  ’ he demanded . 
No one said anything , but several of the girls looked at me . I was the only girl with my face not
covered . 
That ’ s when he lifted up a black pistol . I later learned it was a Colt 45 . Some of the girls screamed . 
Moniba tells me I squeezed her hand . 
My friends say he fired three shots , one after another . The first went through my left eye socket and
out under my left shoulder . I slumped forward onto Moniba , blood coming from my left ear , so the
other two bullets hit the girls next to me . One bullet went into Shazia ’ s left hand . The third went
through her left shoulder and into the upper right arm of Kainat Riaz . 
My friends later told me the gunman ’ s hand was shaking as he fired . 
By the time we got to the hospital my long hair and Moniba ’ s lap were full of blood . 
Who is Malala ? I am Malala and this is my story . 
PART ONE
Before the Taliban
Sorey sorey pa golo rashey
Da be nangai awaz de ra ma sha mayena
Rather I receive your bullet-riddled body with honour
Than news of your cowardice on the battlefield 
( Traditional Pashto couplet )

A Daughter Is Born
WHEN I WAS born , people in our village commiserated with my mother and nobody congratulated my
father . I arrived at dawn as the last star blinked out . We Pashtuns see this as an auspicious sign . My
father didn ’ t have any money for the hospital or for a midwife so a neighbour helped at my birth . My
parents ’ first child was stillborn but I popped out kicking and screaming . I was a girl in a land where
rifles are fired in celebration of a son , while daughters are hidden away behind a curtain , their role in
life simply to prepare food and give birth to children . 
For most Pashtuns it ’ s a gloomy day when a daughter is born . My father ’ s cousin Jehan Sher Khan
Yousafzai was one of the few who came to celebrate my birth and even gave a handsome gift of
money . Yet , he brought with him a vast family tree of our clan , the Dalokhel Yousafzai , going right
back to my great-great-grandfather and showing only the male line . My father , Ziauddin , is different
from most Pashtun men . He took the tree , drew a line like a lollipop from his name and at the end of it
he wrote ,  ‘ Malala ’  . His cousin laughed in astonishment . My father didn ’ t care . He says he looked into
my eyes after I was born and fell in love . He told people ,  ‘ I know there is something different about
this child .  ’ He even asked friends to throw dried fruits , sweets and coins into my cradle , something
we usually only do for boys . 
I was named after Malalai of Maiwand , the greatest heroine of Afghanistan . Pashtuns are a proud
people of many tribes split between Pakistan and Afghanistan . We live as we have for centuries by a
code called Pashtunwali , which obliges us to give hospitality to all guests and in which the most
important value is nang or honour . The worst thing that can happen to a Pashtun is loss of face . Shame
is a very terrible thing for a Pashtun man . We have a saying ,  ‘ Without honour , the world counts for
nothing .  ’ We fight and feud among ourselves so much that our word for cousin – tarbur – is the same
as our word for enemy . But we always come together against outsiders who try to conquer our lands . 
All Pashtun children grow up with the story of how Malalai inspired the Afghan army to defeat the
British in 1880 in one of the biggest battles of the Second Anglo-Afghan War . 
Malalai was the daughter of a shepherd in Maiwand , a small town on the dusty plains west of
Kandahar . When she was a teenager , both her father and the man she was supposed to marry were
among thousands of Afghans fighting against the British occupation of their country . Malalai went to
the battlefield with other women from the village to tend the wounded and take them water . She saw
their men were losing , and when the flag-bearer fell she lifted her white veil up high and marched
onto the battlefield in front of the troops . 
 ‘ Young love !  ’ she shouted .  ‘ If you do not fall in the battle of Maiwand then , by God , someone is
saving you as a symbol of shame .  ’ 
Malalai was killed under fire , but her words and bravery inspired the men to turn the battle around . 
They destroyed an entire brigade , one of the worst defeats in the history of the British army . The
Afghans were so proud that the last Afghan king built a Maiwand victory monument in the centre of
Kabul . In high school I read some Sherlock Holmes and laughed to see that this was the same battle
where Dr Watson was wounded before becoming partner to the great detective . In Malalai we
Pashtuns have our very own Joan of Arc . Many girls ’ schools in Afghanistan are named after her . But
my grandfather , who was a religious scholar and village cleric , didn ’ t like my father giving me that
name .  ‘ It ’ s a sad name ,  ’ he said .  ‘ It means grief-stricken .  ’ 
When I was a baby my father used to sing me a song written by the famous poet Rahmat Shah Sayel
of Peshawar . The last verse ends , 
O Malalai of Maiwand , 
Rise once more to make Pashtuns understand the song of honour , 
Your poetic words turn worlds around , 
I beg you , rise again
My father told the story of Malalai to anyone who came to our house . I loved hearing the story and
the songs my father sang to me , and the way my name floated on the wind when people called it . 
We lived in the most beautiful place in all the world . My valley , the Swat Valley , is a heavenly
kingdom of mountains , gushing waterfalls and crystal-clear lakes . WELCOME TO PARADISE , it says on a
sign as you enter the valley . In olden times Swat was called Uddyana , which means ‘ garden ’  . We
have fields of wild flowers , orchards of delicious fruit , emerald mines and rivers full of trout . People
often call Swat the Switzerland of the East – we even had Pakistan ’ s first ski resort . The rich people
of Pakistan came on holiday to enjoy our clean air and scenery and our Sufi festivals of music and
dancing . And so did many foreigners , all of whom we called angrezan – ‘ English ’ – wherever they
came from . Even the Queen of England came , and stayed in the White Palace that was built from the
same marble as the Taj Mahal by our king , the first wali of Swat . 
We have a special history too . Today Swat is part of the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa , or
KPK , as many Pakistanis call it , but Swat used to be separate from the rest of Pakistan . We were once
a princely state , one of three with the neighbouring lands of Chitral and Dir . In colonial times our
kings owed allegiance to the British but ruled their own land . When the British gave India
independence in 1947 and divided it , we went with the newly created Pakistan but stayed
autonomous . We used the Pakistani rupee , but the government of Pakistan could only intervene on
foreign policy . The wali administered justice , kept the peace between warring tribes and collected
ushur – a tax of ten per cent of income – with which he built roads , hospitals and schools . 
We were only a hundred miles from Pakistan ’ s capital Islamabad as the crow flies but it felt as if it
was in another country . The journey took at least five hours by road over the Malakand Pass , a vast
bowl of mountains where long ago our ancestors led by a preacher called Mullah Saidullah ( known
by the British as the Mad Fakir ) battled British forces among the craggy peaks . Among them was
Winston Churchill , who wrote a book about it , and we still call one of the peaks Churchill ’ s Picket
even though he was not very complimentary about our people . At the end of the pass is a green-domed
shrine where people throw coins to give thanks for their safe arrival . 
No one I knew had been to Islamabad . Before the troubles came , most people , like my mother , had
never been outside Swat . 
We lived in Mingora , the biggest town in the valley , in fact the only city . It used to be a small place
but many people had moved in from surrounding villages , making it dirty and crowded . It has hotels , 
colleges , a golf course and a famous bazaar for buying our traditional embroidery , gemstones and
anything you can think of . The Marghazar stream loops through it , milky brown from the plastic bags
and rubbish thrown into it . It is not clear like the streams in the hilly areas or like the wide River
Swat just outside town , where people fished for trout and which we visited on holidays . Our house
was in Gulkada , which means ‘ place of flowers ’  , but it used to be called Butkara , or ‘ place of the
Buddhist statues ’  . Near our home was a field scattered with mysterious ruins – statues of lions on
their haunches , broken columns , headless figures and , oddest of all , hundreds of stone umbrellas . 
Islam came to our valley in the eleventh century when Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni invaded from
Afghanistan and became our ruler , but in ancient times Swat was a Buddhist kingdom . The Buddhists
had arrived here in the second century and their kings ruled the valley for more than 500 years . 
Chinese explorers wrote stories of how there were 1 , 400 Buddhist monasteries along the banks of the
River Swat , and the magical sound of temple bells would ring out across the valley . The temples are
long gone , but almost anywhere you go in Swat , amid all the primroses and other wild flowers , you
find their remains . We would often picnic among rock carvings of a smiling fat Buddha sitting crosslegged on a lotus flower . There are many stories that Lord Buddha himself came here because it is a
place of such peace , and some of his ashes are said to be buried in the valley in a giant stupa . 
Our Butkara ruins were a magical place to play hide and seek . Once some foreign archaeologists
arrived to do some work there and told us that in times gone by it was a place of pilgrimage , full of
beautiful temples domed with gold where Buddhist kings lay buried . My father wrote a poem ,  ‘ The
Relics of Butkara ’  , which summed up perfectly how temple and mosque could exist side by side : 
 ‘ When the voice of truth rises from the minarets ,  / The Buddha smiles ,  / And the broken chain of
history reconnects .  ’ 
We lived in the shadow of the Hindu Kush mountains , where the men went to shoot ibex and golden
cockerels . Our house was one storey and proper concrete . On the left were steps up to a flat roof big
enough for us children to play cricket on . It was our playground . At dusk my father and his friends
often gathered to sit and drink tea there . Sometimes I sat on the roof too , watching the smoke rise from
the cooking fires all around and listening to the nightly racket of the crickets . 
Our valley is full of fruit trees on which grow the sweetest figs and pomegranates and peaches , and
in our garden we had grapes , guavas and persimmons . There was a plum tree in our front yard which
gave the most delicious fruit . It was always a race between us and the birds to get to them . The birds
loved that tree . Even the woodpeckers . 
For as long as I can remember my mother has talked to birds . At the back of the house was a
veranda where the women gathered . We knew what it was like to be hungry so my mother always
cooked extra and gave food to poor families . If there was any left she fed it to the birds . In Pashto we
love to sing tapey , two-line poems , and as she scattered the rice she would sing one :  ‘ Don ’ t kill
doves in the garden .  / You kill one and the others won ’ t come .  ’ 
I liked to sit on the roof and watch the mountains and dream . The highest mountain of all is the
pyramid-shaped Mount Elum . To us it ’ s a sacred mountain and so high that it always wears a
necklace of fleecy clouds . Even in summer it ’ s frosted with snow . At school we learned that in 327
BC , even before the Buddhists came to Swat , Alexander the Great swept into the valley with
thousands of elephants and soldiers on his way from Afghanistan to the Indus . The Swati people fled
up the mountain , believing they would be protected by their gods because it was so high . But
Alexander was a determined and patient leader . He built a wooden ramp from which his catapults and
arrows could reach the top of the mountain . Then he climbed up so he could catch hold of the star of
Jupiter as a symbol of his power . 
From the rooftop I watched the mountains change with the seasons . In the autumn chill winds would
come . In the winter everything was white snow , long icicles hanging from the roof like daggers , 
which we loved to snap off . We raced around , building snowmen and snow bears and trying to catch
snowflakes . Spring was when Swat was at its greenest . Eucalyptus blossom blew into the house , 
coating everything white , and the wind carried the pungent smell of the rice fields . I was born in
summer , which was perhaps why it was my favourite time of year , even though in Mingora summer
was hot and dry and the stream stank where people dumped their garbage . 
When I was born we were very poor . My father and a friend had founded their first school and we
lived in a shabby shack of two rooms opposite the school . I slept with my mother and father in one
room and the other was for guests . We had no bathroom or kitchen , and my mother cooked on a wood
fire on the ground and washed our clothes at a tap in the school . Our home was always full of people
visiting from the village . Hospitality is an important part of Pashtun culture . 
Two years after I was born my brother Khushal arrived . Like me he was born at home as we still
could not afford the hospital , and he was named Khushal like my father ’ s school , after the Pashtun
hero Khushal Khan Khattak , a warrior who was also a poet . My mother had been waiting for a son
and could not hide her joy when he was born . To me he seemed very thin and small , like a reed that
could snap in the wind , but he was the apple of her eye , her ladla . It seemed to me that his every wish
was her command . He wanted tea all the time , our traditional tea with milk and sugar and cardamom , 
but even my mother tired of this and eventually made some so bitter that he lost the taste for it . She
wanted to buy a new cradle for him – when I was born my father couldn ’ t afford one so they used an
old wooden one from the neighbours which was already third or fourth hand – but my father refused . 
 ‘ Malala swung in that cradle ,  ’ he said .  ‘ So can he .  ’ Then , nearly five years later , another boy was
born – Atal , bright-eyed and inquisitive like a squirrel . After that , said my father , we were complete . 
Three children is a small family by Swati standards , where most people have seven or eight . 
I played mostly with Khushal because he was just two years younger than me , but we fought all the
time . He would go crying to my mother and I would go to my father .  ‘ What ’ s wrong , Jani ?  ’ he would
ask . Like him I was born double-jointed and can bend my fingers right back on themselves . And my
ankles click when I walk , which makes adults squirm . 
My mother is very beautiful and my father adored her as if she were a fragile china vase , never
laying a hand on her , unlike many of our men . Her name Tor Pekai means ‘ raven tresses ’ even though
her hair is chestnut brown . My grandfather , Janser Khan , had been listening to Radio Afghanistan just
before she was born and heard the name . I wished I had her white-lily skin , fine features and green
eyes , but instead had inherited the sallow complexion , wide nose and brown eyes of my father . In our
culture we all have nicknames – aside from Pisho , which my mother had called me since I was a
baby , some of my cousins called me Lachi , which is Pashto for ‘ cardamom ’  . Black-skinned people
are often called white and short people tall . We have a funny sense of humour . My father was known
in the family as Khaista dada , which means beautiful . 
When I was around four years old I asked my father ,  ‘ Aba , what colour are you ?  ’ He replied ,  ‘ I
don ’ t know , a bit white , a bit black .  ’ 
 ‘ It ’ s like when one mixes milk with tea ,  ’ I said . 
He laughed a lot , but as a boy he had been so self-conscious about being dark-skinned that he went
to the fields to get buffalo milk to spread on his face , thinking it would make him lighter . It was only
when he met my mother that he became comfortable in his own skin . Being loved by such a beautiful
girl gave him confidence . 
In our society marriages are usually arranged by families , but theirs was a love match . I could
listen endlessly to the story of how they met . They came from neighbouring villages in a remote valley
in the upper Swat called Shangla and would see each other when my father went to his uncle ’ s house
to study , which was next door to that of my mother ’ s aunt . They glimpsed enough of each other to
know they liked one another , but for us it is taboo to express such things . Instead he sent her poems
she could not read . 
 ‘ I admired his mind ,  ’ she says . 
 ‘ And me , her beauty ,  ’ he laughs . 
There was one big problem . My two grandfathers did not get on . So when my father announced his
desire to ask for the hand of my mother , Tor Pekai , it was clear neither side would welcome the
marriage . His own father said it was up to him and agreed to send a barber as a messenger , which is
the traditional way we Pashtuns do this . Malik Janser Khan refused the proposal , but my father is a
stubborn man and persuaded my grandfather to send the barber again . Janser Khan ’ s hujra was a
gathering place for people to talk politics , and my father was often there , so they had got to know each
other . He made him wait nine months but finally agreed . 
My mother comes from a family of strong women as well as influential men . Her grandmother – my
great-grandmother – was widowed when her children were young , and her eldest son Janser Khan
was locked up because of a tribal feud with another family when he was only nine . To get him
released she walked forty miles alone over mountains to appeal to a powerful cousin . I think my
mother would do the same for us . Though she cannot read or write , my father shares everything with
her , telling her about his day , the good and the bad . She teases him a lot and gives him advice about
who she thinks is a genuine friend and who is not , and my father says she is always right . Most
Pashtun men never do this , as sharing problems with women is seen as weak .  ‘ He even asks his
wife !  ’ they say as an insult . I see my parents happy and laughing a lot . People would see us and say
we are a sweet family . 
My mother is very pious and prays five times a day , though not in the mosque as that is only for the
men . She disapproves of dancing because she says God would not like it , but she loves to decorate
herself with pretty things , embroidered clothes and golden necklaces and bangles . I think I am a bit of
a disappointment to her as I am so like my father and don ’ t bother with clothes and jewels . I get bored
going to the bazaar but I love to dance behind closed doors with my school friends . 
Growing up , we children spent most of our time with our mother . My father was out a lot as he was
busy , not just with his school , but also with literary societies and jirgas , as well as trying to save the
environment , trying to save our valley . My father came from a backward village yet through education
and force of personality he made a good living for us and a name for himself . 
People liked to hear him talk , and I loved the evenings when guests visited . We would sit on the
floor around a long plastic sheet which my mother laid with food , and eat with our right hand as is our
custom , balling together rice and meat . As darkness fell we sat by the light of oil lamps , batting away
the flies as our silhouettes made dancing shadows on the walls . In the summer months there would
often be thunder and lightning crashing outside and I would crawl closer to my father ’ s knee . 
I would listen rapt as he told stories of warring tribes , Pashtun leaders and saints , often through
poems that he read in a melodious voice , crying sometimes as he read . Like most people in Swat we
are from the Yousafzai tribe . We Yousafzai ( which some people spell Yusufzai or Yousufzai ) are
originally from Kandahar and are one of the biggest Pashtun tribes , spread across Pakistan and
Afghanistan . 
Our ancestors came to Swat in the sixteenth century from Kabul , where they had helped a Timurid
emperor win back his throne after his own tribe removed him . The emperor rewarded them with
important positions in the court and army , but his friends and relatives warned him that the Yousafzai
were becoming so powerful they would overthrow him . So one night he invited all the chiefs to a
banquet and set his men on them while they were eating . Around 600 chiefs were massacred . Only
two escaped , and they fled to Peshawar along with their tribesmen . After some time they went to visit
some tribes in Swat to win their support so they could return to Afghanistan . But they were so
captivated by the beauty of Swat they instead decided to stay there and forced the other tribes out . 
The Yousafzai divided up all the land among the male members of the tribe . It was a peculiar
system called wesh under which every five or ten years all the families would swap villages and
redistribute the land of the new village among the men so that everyone had the chance to work on
good as well as bad land . It was thought this would then keep rival clans from fighting . Villages were
ruled by khans , and the common people , craftsmen and labourers , were their tenants . They had to pay
them rent in kind , usually a share of their crop . They also had to help the khans form a militia by
providing an armed man for every small plot of land . Each khan kept hundreds of armed men both for
feuds and to raid and loot other villages . 
As the Yousafzai in Swat had no ruler , there were constant feuds between the khans and even
within their own families . Our men all have rifles , though these days they don ’ t walk around with
them like they do in other Pashtun areas , and my great-grandfather used to tell stories of gun battles
when he was a boy . In the early part of the last century they became worried about being taken over
by the British , who by then controlled most of the surrounding lands . They were also tired of the
endless bloodshed . So they decided to try and find an impartial man to rule the whole area and
resolve their disputes . 
After a couple of rulers who did not work out , in 1917 the chiefs settled on a man called Miangul
Abdul Wadood as their king . We know him affectionately as Badshah Sahib , and though he was
completely illiterate , he managed to bring peace to the valley . Taking a rifle away from a Pashtun is
like taking away his life , so he could not disarm the tribes . Instead he built forts on mountains all
across Swat and created an army . He was recognised by the British as the head of state in 1926 and
installed as wali , which is our word for ruler . He set up the first telephone system and built the first
primary school and ended the wesh system because the constant moving between villages meant no
one could sell land or had any incentive to build better houses or plant fruit trees . 
In 1949 , two years after the creation of Pakistan , he abdicated in favour of his elder son Miangul
Abdul Haq Jehanzeb . My father always says ,  ‘ While Badshah Sahib brought peace , his son brought
prosperity .  ’ We think of Jehanzeb ’ s reign as a golden period in our history . He had studied in a
British school in Peshawar , and perhaps because his own father was illiterate he was passionate
about schools and built many , as well as hospitals and roads . In the 1950s he ended the system where
people paid taxes to the khans . But there was no freedom of expression , and if anyone criticised the
wali , they could be expelled from the valley . In 1969 , the year my father was born , the wali gave up
power and we became part of Pakistan ’ s North-West Frontier Province , which a few years ago
changed its name to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa . 
So I was born a proud daughter of Pakistan , though like all Swatis I thought of myself first as Swati
and then Pashtun , before Pakistani . 
Near us on our street there was a family with a girl my age called Safina and two boys similar in age
to my brothers , Babar and Basit . We all played cricket on the street or rooftops together , but I knew
as we got older the girls would be expected to stay inside . We ’ d be expected to cook and serve our
brothers and fathers . While boys and men could roam freely about town , my mother and I could not go
out without a male relative to accompany us , even if it was a five-year-old boy ! This was the
tradition . 
I had decided very early I would not be like that . My father always said ,  ‘ Malala will be free as a
bird .  ’ I dreamed of going to the top of Mount Elum like Alexander the Great to touch Jupiter and even
beyond the valley . But , as I watched my brothers running across the roof , flying their kites and
skilfully flicking the strings back and forth to cut each other ’ s down , I wondered how free a daughter
could ever be .

My Father the Falcon
I ALWAYS KNEW my father had trouble with words . Sometimes they would get stuck and he would
repeat the same syllable over and over like a record caught in a groove as we all waited for the next
syllable to suddenly pop out . He said it felt like a wall came down in his throat . M ’ s , p ’ s and k ’ s
were all enemies lying in wait . I teased him that one of the reasons he called me Jani was because he
found it easier to say than Malala . A stutter was a terrible thing for a man who so loved words and
poetry . On each side of the family he had an uncle with the same affliction . But it was almost certainly
made worse by his father , whose own voice was a soaring instrument that could make words thunder
and dance . 
 ‘ Spit it out , son !  ’ he ’ d roar whenever my father got stuck in the middle of a sentence . My
grandfather ’ s name was Rohul Amin , which means ‘ honest spirit ’ and is the holy name of the Angel
Gabriel . He was so proud of the name that he would introduce himself to people with a famous verse
in which his name appears . He was an impatient man at the best of times and would fly into a rage
over the smallest thing – like a hen going astray or a cup getting broken . His face would redden and he
would throw kettles and pots around . I never knew my grandmother , but my father says she used to
joke with my grandfather ,  ‘ By God , just as you greet us only with a frown , when I die may God give
you a wife who never smiles .  ’ 
My grandmother was so worried about my father ’ s stutter that when he was still a young boy she
took him to see a holy man . It was a long journey by bus , then an hour ’ s walk up the hill to where he
lived . Her nephew Fazli Hakim had to carry my father on his shoulders . The holy man was called
Lewano Pir , Saint of the Mad , because he was said to be able to calm lunatics . When they were taken
in to see the pir , he instructed my father to open his mouth and then spat into it . Then he took some
gur , dark molasses made from sugar cane , and rolled it around his mouth to moisten it with spit . He
then took out the lump and presented it to my grandmother to give to my father , a little each day . The
treatment did not cure the stutter . Actually some people thought it got worse . So when my father was
thirteen and told my grandfather he was entering a public speaking competition he was stunned .  ‘ How
can you ?  ’ Rohul Amin asked , laughing .  ‘ You take one or two minutes to utter just one sentence .  ’ 
 ‘ Don ’ t worry ,  ’ replied my father .  ‘ You write the speech and I will learn it .  ’ 
My grandfather was famous for his speeches . He taught theology in the government high school in
the village of Shahpur . He was also an imam at the local mosque . He was a mesmerising speaker . His
sermons at Friday prayers were so popular that people would come down from the mountains by
donkey or on foot to hear him . 
My father comes from a large family . He had one much older brother , Saeed Ramzan who I call
Uncle Khan dada , and five sisters . Their village of Barkana was very primitive and they lived
crammed together in a one-storey ramshackle house with a mud roof which leaked whenever it rained
or snowed . As in most families , the girls stayed at home while the boys went to school .  ‘ They were
just waiting to be married ,  ’ says my father . 
School wasn ’ t the only thing my aunts missed out on . In the morning when my father was given
cream or milk , his sisters were given tea with no milk . If there were eggs , they would only be for the
boys . When a chicken was slaughtered for dinner , the girls would get the wings and the neck while the
luscious breast meat was enjoyed by my father , his brother and my grandfather .  ‘ From early on I could
feel I was different from my sisters ,  ’ my father says . 
There was little to do in my father ’ s village . It was too narrow even for a cricket pitch and only
one family had a television . On Fridays the brothers would creep into the mosque and watch in
wonder as my grandfather stood in the pulpit and preached to the congregation for an hour or so , 
waiting for the moment when his voice would rise and practically shake the rafters . 
My grandfather had studied in India , where he had seen great speakers and leaders including
Mohammad Ali Jinnah ( the founder of Pakistan )  , Jawaharlal Nehru , Mahatma Gandhi and Khan Abdul
Ghaffar Khan , our great Pashtun leader who campaigned for independence . Baba , as I called him , had
even witnessed the moment of freedom from the British colonialists at midnight on 14 August 1947 . 
He had an old radio set my uncle still has , on which he loved to listen to the news . His sermons were
often illustrated by world events or historical happenings as well as stories from the Quran and the
Hadith , the sayings of the Prophet . He also liked to talk about politics . Swat became part of Pakistan
in 1969 , the year my father was born . Many Swatis were unhappy about this , complaining about the
Pakistani justice system , which they said was much slower and less effective than their old tribal
ways . My grandfather would rail against the class system , the continuing power of the khans and the
gap between the haves and have-nots . 
My country may not be very old but unfortunately it already has a history of military coups , and
when my father was eight a general called Zia ul-Haq seized power . There are still many pictures of
him around . He was a scary man with dark panda shadows around his eyes , large teeth that seemed to
stand to attention and hair pomaded flat on his head . He arrested our elected prime minister , Zulfikar
Ali Bhutto , and had him tried for treason then hanged from a scaffold in Rawalpindi jail . Even today
people talk of Mr Bhutto as a man of great charisma . They say he was the first Pakistani leader to
stand up for the common people , though he himself was a feudal lord with vast estates of mango
fields . His execution shocked everybody and made Pakistan look bad all around the world . The
Americans cut off aid . 
To try to get people at home to support him , General Zia launched a campaign of Islamisation to
make us a proper Muslim country with the army as the defenders of our country ’ s ideological as well
as geographical frontiers . He told our people it was their duty to obey his government because it was
pursuing Islamic principles . Zia even wanted to dictate how we should pray , and set up salat or
prayer committees in every district , even in our remote village , and appointed 100 , 000 prayer
inspectors . Before then mullahs had almost been figures of fun – my father said at wedding parties
they would just hang around in a corner and leave early – but under Zia they became influential and
were called to Islamabad for guidance on sermons . Even my grandfather went . 
Under Zia ’ s regime life for women in Pakistan became much more restricted . Jinnah said ,  ‘ No
struggle can ever succeed without women participating side by side with men . There are two powers
in the world ; one is the sword and the other is the pen . There is a third power stronger than both , that
of women .  ’ But General Zia brought in Islamic laws which reduced a woman ’ s evidence in court to
count for only half that of a man ’ s . Soon our prisons were full of cases like that of a thirteen-year-old
girl who was raped and become pregnant and was then sent to prison for adultery because she
couldn ’ t produce four male witnesses to prove it was a crime . A woman couldn ’ t even open a bank
account without a man ’ s permission . As a nation we have always been good at hockey , but Zia made
our female hockey players wear baggy trousers instead of shorts , and stopped women playing some
sports altogether . 
Many of our madrasas or religious schools were opened at that time , and in all schools religious
studies , what we call deeniyat , was replaced by Islamiyat , or Islamic studies , which children in
Pakistan still have to do today . Our history textbooks were rewritten to describe Pakistan as a
 ‘ fortress of Islam ’  , which made it seem as if we had existed far longer than since 1947 , and
denounced Hindus and Jews . Anyone reading them might think we won the three wars we have fought
and lost against our great enemy India . 
Everything changed when my father was ten . Just after Christmas 1979 the Russians invaded our
neighbour Afghanistan . Millions of Afghans fled across the border and General Zia gave them refuge . 
Vast camps of white tents sprang up mostly around Peshawar , some of which are still there today . Our
biggest intelligence service belongs to the military and is called the ISI . It started a massive
programme to train Afghan refugees recruited from the camps as resistance fighters or mujahideen . 
Though Afghans are renowned fighters , Colonel Imam , the officer heading the programme , 
complained that trying to organise them was ‘ like weighing frogs ’  . 
The Russian invasion transformed Zia from an international pariah to the great defender of freedom
in the Cold War . The Americans became friends with us once again , as in those days Russia was their
main enemy . Next door to us the Shah of Iran had been overthrown in a revolution a few months
earlier so the CIA had lost their main base in the region . Pakistan took its place . Billions of dollars
flowed into our exchequer from the United States and other Western countries , as well as weapons to
help the ISI train the Afghans to fight the communist Red Army . General Zia was invited to meet
President Ronald Reagan at the White House and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher at 10 Downing
Street . They lavished praise on him . 
Prime Minister Zulfikar Bhutto had appointed Zia as his army chief because he thought he was not
very intelligent and would not be a threat . He called him his ‘ monkey ’  . But Zia turned out to be a very
wily man . He made Afghanistan a rallying point not only for the West , which wanted to stop the
spread of communism from the Soviet Union , but also for Muslims from Sudan to Tajikistan , who saw
it as a fellow Islamic country under attack from infidels . Money poured in from all over the Arab
world , particularly Saudi Arabia , which matched whatever the US sent , and volunteer fighters too , 
including a Saudi millionaire called Osama bin Laden . 
We Pashtuns are split between Pakistan and Afghanistan and don ’ t really recognise the border that
the British drew more than 100 years ago . So our blood boiled over the Soviet invasion for both
religious and nationalist reasons . The clerics of the mosques would often talk about the Soviet
occupation of Afghanistan in their sermons , condemning the Russians as infidels and urging people to
join the jihad , saying it was their duty as good Muslims . It was as if under Zia jihad had become the
sixth pillar of our religion on top of the five we grow up to learn – the belief in one God , namaz or
prayers five times a day , giving zakat or alms , roza – fasting from dawn till sunset during the month
of Ramadan – and haj , the pilgrimage to Mecca , which every able-bodied Muslim should do once in
their lifetime . My father says that in our part of the world this idea of jihad was very much
encouraged by the CIA . Children in the refugee camps were even given school textbooks produced by
an American university which taught basic arithmetic through fighting . They had examples like ,  ‘ If out
of 10 Russian infidels , 5 are killed by one Muslim , 5 would be left ’ or ‘ 15 bullets – 10 bullets = 5
bullets ’  . 
Some boys from my father ’ s district went off to fight in Afghanistan . My father remembers that one
day a maulana called Sufi Mohammad came to the village and asked young men to join him to fight
the Russians in the name of Islam . Many did , and they set off , armed with old rifles or just axes and
bazookas . Little did we know that years later the same maulana ’ s organisation would become the
Swat Taliban . At that time my father was only twelve years old and too young to fight . But the
Russians ended up stuck in Afghanistan for ten years , through most of the 1980s , and when he became
a teenager my father decided he too wanted to be a jihadi . Though later he became less regular in his
prayers , in those days he used to leave home at dawn every morning to walk to a mosque in another
village , where he studied the Quran with a senior talib . At that time talib simply meant ‘ religious
student ’  . Together they studied all the thirty chapters of the Quran , not just recitation but also
interpretation , something few boys do . 
The talib talked of jihad in such glorious terms that my father was captivated . He would endlessly
point out to my father that life on earth was short and that there were few opportunities for young men
in the village . Our family owned little land , and my father did not want to end up going south to work
in the coal mines like many of his classmates . That was tough and dangerous work , and the coffins of
those killed in accidents would come back several times a year . The best that most village boys could
hope for was to go to Saudi Arabia or Dubai and work in construction . So heaven with its seventytwo virgins sounded attractive . Every night my father would pray to God ,  ‘ O Allah , please make war
between Muslims and infidels so I can die in your service and be a martyr .  ’ 
For a while his Muslim identity seemed more important than anything else in his life . He began to
sign himself ‘ Ziauddin Panchpiri ’  ( the Panchpiri are a religious sect ) and sprouted the first signs of a
beard . It was , he says , a kind of brainwashing . He believes he might even have thought of becoming a
suicide bomber had there been such a thing in those days . But from an early age he had been a
questioning kind of boy who rarely took anything at face value , even though our education at
government schools meant learning by rote and pupils were not supposed to question teachers . 
It was around the time he was praying to go to heaven as a martyr that he met my mother ’ s brother , 
Faiz Mohammad , and started mixing with her family and going to her father ’ s hujra . They were very
involved in local politics , belonged to secular nationalist parties and were against involvement in the
war . A famous poem was written at that time by Rahmat Shah Sayel , the same Peshawar poet who
wrote the poem about my namesake . He described what was happening in Afghanistan as a ‘ war
between two elephants ’ – the US and the Soviet Union – not our war , and said that we Pashtuns were
 ‘ like the grass crushed by the hooves of two fierce beasts ’  . My father often used to recite the poem to
me when I was a child but I didn ’ t know then what it meant . 
My father was very impressed by Faiz Mohammad and thought he talked a lot of sense , particularly
about wanting to end the feudal and capitalist systems in our country , where the same big families had
controlled things for years while the poor got poorer . He found himself torn between the two
extremes , secularism and socialism on one side and militant Islam on the other . I guess he ended up
somewhere in the middle . 
My father was in awe of my grandfather and told me wonderful stories about him , but he also told
me that he was a man who could not meet the high standards he set for others . Baba was such a
popular and passionate speaker that he could have been a great leader if he had been more diplomatic
and less consumed by rivalries with cousins and others who were better off . In Pashtun society it is
very hard to stomach a cousin being more popular , wealthier or more influential than you are . My
grandfather had a cousin who also joined his school as a teacher . When he got the job he gave his age
as much younger than my grandfather . Our people don ’ t know their exact dates of birth – my mother , 
for example , does not know when she was born . We tend to remember years by events , like an
earthquake . But my grandfather knew that his cousin was actually much older than him . He was so
angry that he made the day-long bus journey to Mingora to see the Swat minister of education . 
 ‘ Sahib ,  ’ he told him ,  ‘ I have a cousin who is ten years older than me and you have certified him ten
years younger .  ’ So the minister said ,  ‘ OK , Maulana , what shall I write down for you ? Would you like
to have been born in the year of the earthquake of Quetta ?  ’ My grandfather agreed , so his new date of
birth became 1935 , making him much younger than his cousin . 
This family rivalry meant that my father was bullied a lot by his cousins . They knew he was
insecure about his looks because at school the teachers always favoured the handsome boys for their
fair skin . His cousins would stop my father on his way home from school and tease him about being
short and dark-skinned . In our society you have to take revenge for such slights , but my father was
much smaller than his cousins . 
He also felt he could never do enough to please my grandfather . Baba had beautiful handwriting
and my father would spend hours painstakingly drawing letters but Baba never once praised him . 
My grandmother kept his spirits up – he was her favourite and she believed great things lay in store
for him . She loved him so much that she would slip him extra meat and the cream off the milk while
she went without . But it wasn ’ t easy to study as there was no electricity in the village in those days . 
He used to read by the light of the oil lamp in the hujra , and one evening he went to sleep and the oil
lamp fell over . Fortunately my grandmother found him before a fire started . It was my grandmother ’ s
faith in my father that gave him the courage to find his own proud path he could travel along . This is
the path that he would later show me . 
Yet she too got angry with him once . Holy men from a spiritual place called Derai Saydan used to
travel the villages in those days begging for flour . One day while his parents were out some of them
came to the house . My father broke the seal on the wooden storage box of maize and filled their
bowls . When my grandparents came home they were furious and beat him . 
Pashtuns are famously frugal ( though generous with guests )  , and Baba was particularly careful with
money . If any of his children accidentally spilt their food he would fly into a rage . He was an
extremely disciplined man and could not understand why they were not the same . As a teacher he was
eligible for a discount on his sons ’ school fees for sports and joining the Boy Scouts . It was such a
small discount that most teachers did not bother , but he forced my father to apply for the rebate . Of
course my father detested doing this . As he waited outside the headmaster ’ s office , he broke out into a
sweat , and once inside his stutter was worse than ever .  ‘ It felt as if my honour was at stake for five
rupees ,  ’ he told me . My grandfather never bought him new books . Instead he would tell his best
students to keep their old books for my father at the end of the year and then he would be sent to their
homes to get them . He felt ashamed but had no choice if he didn ’ t want to end up illiterate . All his
books were inscribed with other boys ’ names , never his own . 
 ‘ It ’ s not that passing books on is a bad practice ,  ’ he says .  ‘ It ’ s just I so wanted a new book , 
unmarked by another student and bought with my father ’ s money .  ’ 
My father ’ s dislike of Baba ’ s frugality has made him a very generous man both materially and in
spirit . He became determined to end the traditional rivalry between him and his cousins . When his
headmaster ’ s wife fell ill , my father donated blood to help save her . The man was astonished and
apologised for having tormented him . When my father tells me stories of his childhood , he always
says that though Baba was a difficult man he gave him the most important gift – the gift of education . 
He sent my father to the government high school to learn English and receive a modern education
rather than to a madrasa , even though as an imam people criticised him for this . Baba also gave him a
deep love of learning and knowledge as well as a keen awareness of people ’ s rights , which my father
has passed on to me . In my grandfather ’ s Friday addresses he would talk about the poor and the
landowners and how true Islam is against feudalism . He also spoke Persian and Arabic and cared
deeply for words . He read the great poems of Saadi , Allama Iqbal and Rumi to my father with such
passion and fire it was as if he was teaching the whole mosque . 
My father longed to be eloquent with a voice that boomed out with no stammer , and he knew my
grandfather desperately wanted him to be a doctor , but though he was a very bright student and a
gifted poet , he was poor at maths and science and felt he was a disappointment . That ’ s why he
decided he would make his father proud by entering the district ’ s annual public speaking competition . 
Everyone thought he was mad . His teachers and friends tried to dissuade him and his father was
reluctant to write the speech for him . But eventually Baba gave him a fine speech , which my father
practised and practised . He committed every word to memory while walking in the hills , reciting it to
the skies and birds as there was no privacy in their home . 
There was not much to do in the area where they lived so when the day arrived there was a huge
gathering . Other boys , some known as good speakers , gave their speeches . Finally my father was
called forward .  ‘ I stood at the lectern ,  ’ he told me ,  ‘ hands shaking and knees knocking , so short I
could barely see over the top and so terrified the faces were a blur . My palms were sweating and my
mouth was as dry as paper .  ’ He tried desperately not to think about the treacherous consonants lying
ahead of him , just waiting to trip him up and stick in his throat , but when he spoke , the words came
out fluently like beautiful butterflies taking flight . His voice did not boom like his father ’ s , but his
passion shone through and as he went on he gained confidence . 
At the end of the speech there were cheers and applause . Best of all , as he went up to collect the
cup for first prize , he saw his father clapping and enjoying being patted on the back by those standing
around him .  ‘ It was ,  ’ he says ,  ‘ the first thing I ’ d done that made him smile .  ’ 
After that my father entered every competition in the district . My grandfather wrote his speeches
and he almost always came first , gaining a reputation locally as an impressive speaker . My father had
turned his weakness into strength . For the first time Baba started praising him in front of others . He ’ d
boast ,  ‘ Ziauddin is a shaheen ’ – a falcon – because this is a creature that flies high above other birds . 
 ‘ Write your name as “ Ziauddin Shaheen ”  ,  ’ he told him . For a while my father did this but stopped
when he realised that although a falcon flies high it is a cruel bird . Instead he just called himself
Ziauddin Yousafzai , our clan name .

Growing up in a School
MY MOTHER STARTED school when she was six and stopped the same term . She was unusual in the
village as she had a father and brothers who encouraged her to go to school . She was the only girl in a
class of boys . She carried her bag of books proudly into school and claims she was brighter than the
boys . But every day she would leave behind her girl cousins playing at home and she envied them . 
There seemed no point in going to school just to end up cooking , cleaning and bringing up children , so
one day she sold her books for nine annas , spent the money on boiled sweets and never went back . 
Her father said nothing . She says he didn ’ t even notice , as he would set off early every morning after
a breakfast of cornbread and cream , his German pistol strapped under his arm , and spend his days
busy with local politics or resolving feuds . Besides he had seven other children to think about . 
It was only when she met my father that she felt regret . Here was a man who had read so many
books , who wrote her poems she could not read , and whose ambition was to have his own school . As
his wife , she wanted to help him achieve that . For as long as my father could remember it had been
his dream to open a school , but with no family contacts or money it was extremely hard for him to
realise this dream . He thought there was nothing more important than knowledge . He remembered
how mystified he had been by the river in his village , wondering where the water came from and went
to , until he learned about the water cycle from the rain to the sea . 
His own village school had been just a small building . Many of his classes were taught under a tree
on the bare ground . There were no toilets and the pupils went to the fields to answer the call of
nature . Yet he says he was actually lucky . His sisters – my aunts – did not go to school at all , just like
millions of girls in my country . Education had been a great gift for him . He believed that lack of
education was the root of all Pakistan ’ s problems . Ignorance allowed politicians to fool people and
bad administrators to be re-elected . He believed schooling should be available for all , rich and poor , 
boys and girls . The school that my father dreamed of would have desks and a library , computers , 
bright posters on the walls and , most important , washrooms . 
My grandfather had a different dream for his youngest son – he longed for him to be a doctor – and
as one of just two sons , he expected him to contribute to the household budget . My father ’ s elder
brother Saeed Ramzan had worked for years as a teacher at a local school . He and his family lived
with my grandfather , and whenever he saved up enough of his salary , they built a small concrete hujra
at the side of the house for guests . He brought logs back from the mountains for firewood , and after
teaching he would work in the fields where our family had a few buffaloes . He also helped Baba with
heavy tasks like clearing snow from the roof . 
When my father was offered a place for his A Levels at Jehanzeb College , which is the best further
education institution in Swat , my grandfather refused to pay for his living expenses . His own
education in Delhi had been free – he had lived like a talib in the mosques , and local people had
provided the students with food and clothes . Tuition at Jehanzeb was free but my father needed money
to live on . Pakistan doesn ’ t have student loans and he had never even set foot in a bank . The college
was in Saidu Sharif , the twin town of Mingora , and he had no family there with whom he could stay . 
There was no other college in Shangla , and if he didn ’ t go to college , he would never be able to move
out of the village and realise his dream . 
My father was at his wits ’ end and wept with frustration . His beloved mother had died just before
he graduated from school . He knew if she had been alive , she would have been on his side . He
pleaded with his father but to no avail . His only hope was his brother-in-law in Karachi . My
grandfather suggested that he might take my father in so he could go to college there . The couple
would soon be arriving in the village as they were coming to offer condolences after my
grandmother ’ s death . 
My father prayed they would agree , but my grandfather asked them as soon as they arrived , 
exhausted after the three-day bus journey , and his son-in-law refused outright . My grandfather was so
furious he would not speak to them for their entire stay . My father felt he had lost his chance and
would end up like his brother teaching in a local school . The school where Uncle Khan dada taught
was in the mountain village of Sewoor , about an hour and a half ’ s climb from their house . It didn ’ t
even have its own building . They used the big hall in the mosque , where they taught more than a
hundred children ranging from five to fifteen years old . 
The people in Sewoor were Gujars , Kohistanis and Mians . We regard Mians as noble or landed
people , but Gujars and Kohistanis are what we call hilly people , peasants who look after buffaloes . 
Their children are usually dirty and they are looked down upon by Pashtuns , even if they are poor
themselves .  ‘ They are dirty , black and stupid ,  ’ people would say .  ‘ Let them be illiterate .  ’ It is often
said that teachers don ’ t like to be posted to such remote schools and generally make a deal with their
colleagues so that only one of them has to go to work each day . If the school has two teachers , each
goes in for three days and signs the other in . If it has three teachers , each goes in for just two days . 
Once there , all they do is keep the children quiet with a long stick as they cannot imagine education
will be any use to them . 
My uncle was more dutiful . He liked the hilly people and respected their tough lives . So he went to
the school most days and actually tried to teach the children . After my father had graduated from
school he had nothing to do so he volunteered to help his brother . There his luck changed . Another of
my aunts had married a man in that village and they had a relative visiting called Nasir Pacha , who
saw my father at work . Nasir Pacha had spent years in Saudi Arabia working in construction , making
money to send back to his family . My father told him he had just finished school and had won a
college place at Jehanzeb . He did not mention he could not afford to take it as he did not want to
embarrass his father . 
 ‘ Why don ’ t you come and live with us ?  ’ asked Nasir Pacha . 
 ‘ Oof , I was so happy , by God ,  ’ says my father . Pacha and his wife Jajai became his second family . 
Their home was in Spal Bandi , a beautiful mountain village on the way to the White Palace , and my
father describes it as a romantic and inspirational place . He went there by bus , and it seemed so big
to him compared to his home village that he thought he ’ d arrived in a city . As a guest , he was treated
exceptionally well . Jajai replaced his late mother as the most important woman in my father ’ s life . 
When a villager complained to her that he was flirting with a girl living across the road , she defended
him .  ‘ Ziauddin is as clean as an egg with no hair ,  ’ she said .  ‘ Look instead to your own daughter .  ’ 
It was in Spal Bandi that my father came across women who had great freedom and were not
hidden away as in his own village . The women of Spal Bandi had a beautiful spot on top of the
mountain where only they could congregate to chat about their everyday lives . It was unusual for
women to have a special place to meet outside the home . It was also there that my father met his
mentor Akbar Khan , who although he had not gone to college himself lent my father money so he
could . Like my mother , Akbar Khan may not have had much of a formal education , but he had another
kind of wisdom . My father often spoke of the kindness of Akbar Khan and Nasir Pacha to illustrate
that if you help someone in need you might also receive unexpected aid . 
My father arrived at college at an important moment in Pakistan ’ s history . That summer , while he was
walking in the mountains , our dictator General Zia was killed in a mysterious plane crash , which
many people said was caused by a bomb hidden in a crate of mangoes . During my father ’ s first term at
college national elections were held , which were won by Benazir Bhutto , daughter of the prime
minister who had been executed when my father was a boy . Benazir was our first female prime
minister and the first in the Islamic world . Suddenly there was a lot of optimism about the future . 
Student organisations which had been banned under Zia became very active . My father quickly got
involved in student politics and became known as a talented speaker and debater . He was made
general secretary of the Pakhtoon Students Federation ( PSF )  , which wanted equal rights for Pashtuns . 
The most important jobs in the army , bureaucracy and government are all taken by Punjabis because
they come from the biggest and most powerful province . 
The other main student organisation was Islami Jamaat-e-Talaba , the student wing of the religious
party Jamaat-e-Islami , which was powerful in many universities in Pakistan . They provided free
textbooks and grants to students but held deeply intolerant views and their favourite pastime was to
patrol universities and sabotage music concerts . The party had been close to General Zia and done
badly in the elections . The president of the students ’ group in Jehanzeb College was Ihsan ul-Haq
Haqqani . Though he and my father were great rivals , they admired each other and later became
friends . Haqqani says he is sure my father would have been president of the PSF and become a
politician if he had been from a rich khan family . Student politics was all about debating and
charisma , but party politics required money . 
One of their most heated debates in that first year was over a novel . The book was called The
Satanic Verses by Salman Rushdie , and it was a parody of the Prophet ’ s life set in Bombay . Muslims
widely considered it blasphemous and it provoked so much outrage that it seemed people were
talking of little else . The odd thing was no one had even noticed the publication of the book to start
with – it wasn ’ t actually on sale in Pakistan – but then a series of articles appeared in Urdu
newspapers by a mullah close to our intelligence service , berating the book as offensive to the
Prophet and saying it was the duty of good Muslims to protest . Soon mullahs all over Pakistan were
denouncing the book , calling for it to be banned , and angry demonstrations were held . The most
violent took place in Islamabad on 12 February 1989 , when American flags were set alight in front of
the American Centre – even though Rushdie and his publishers were British . Police fired into the
crowd , and five people were killed . The anger wasn ’ t just in Pakistan . Two days later Ayatollah
Khomeini , the supreme leader of Iran , issued a fatwa calling for Rushdie ’ s assassination . 
My father ’ s college held a heated debate in a packed room . Many students argued that the book
should be banned and burned and the fatwa upheld . My father also saw the book as offensive to Islam
but believes strongly in freedom of speech .  ‘ First , let ’ s read the book and then why not respond with
our own book ,  ’ he suggested . He ended by asking in a thundering voice my grandfather would have
been proud of ,  ‘ Is Islam such a weak religion that it cannot tolerate a book written against it ? Not my
Islam !  ’ 
For the first few years after graduating from Jehanzeb my father worked as an English teacher in a
well-known private college . But the salary was low , just 1 , 600 rupees a month ( around £12 )  , and my
grandfather complained he was not contributing to the household . It was also not enough for him to
save for the wedding he hoped for to his beloved Tor Pekai . 
One of my father ’ s colleagues at the school was his friend Mohammad Naeem Khan . He and my
father had studied for their bachelors and masters degrees in English together and were both
passionate about education . They were also both frustrated as the school was very strict and
unimaginative . Neither the students nor the teachers were supposed to have their own opinions , and
the owners ’ control was so tight they even frowned upon friendship between teachers . My father
longed for the freedom that would come with running his own school . He wanted to encourage
independent thought and hated the way the school he was at rewarded obedience above openmindedness and creativity . So when Naeem lost his job after a dispute with the college
administration , they decided to start their own school . 
Their original plan was to open a school in my father ’ s village of Shahpur , where there was a
desperate need :  ‘ Like a shop in a community where there are no shops ,  ’ he said . But when they went
there to look for a building , there were banners everywhere advertising a school opening – someone
had beaten them to it . So they decided to set up an English-language school in Mingora , thinking that
since Swat was a tourist destination there would be a demand for learning in English . 
As my father was still teaching , Naeem wandered the streets looking for somewhere to rent . One
day he called my father excitedly to say he ’ d found the ideal place . It was the ground floor of a twostorey building in a well-off area called Landikas with a walled courtyard where students could
gather . The previous tenants had also run a school – the Ramada School . The owner had called it that
because he had once been to Turkey and seen a Ramada Hotel ! But the school had gone bankrupt , 
which perhaps should have made them think twice . Also the building was on the banks of a river
where people threw their rubbish and it smelt foul in hot weather . 
My father went to see the building after work . It was a perfect night with stars and a full moon just
above the trees , which he took to be a sign .  ‘ I felt so happy ,  ’ he recalls .  ‘ My dream was coming true .  ’ 
Naeem and my father invested their entire savings of 60 , 000 rupees . They borrowed 30 , 000 rupees
more to repaint the building , rented a shack across the road to live in and went from door to door
trying to find students . Unfortunately the demand for English tuition turned out to be low , and there
were unexpected drains on their income . My father ’ s involvement in political discussions continued
after college . Every day his fellow activists came to the shack or the school for lunch .  ‘ We can ’ t
afford all this entertaining !  ’ Naeem would complain . It was also becoming clear that while they were
best friends , they found it hard to work as business partners . 
On top of that , there was a stream of guests from Shangla now that my father had a place for them to
stay . We Pashtuns cannot turn away relatives or friends , however inconvenient . We don ’ t respect
privacy and there is no such thing as making an appointment to see someone . Visitors can turn up
whenever they wish and can stay as long as they want . It was a nightmare for someone trying to start a
business and it drove Naeem to distraction . He joked to my father that if either of them had relatives
to stay , they should pay a fine . My father kept trying to persuade Naeem ’ s friends and family to stay so
he could be fined too ! 
After three months Naeem had had enough .  ‘ We are supposed to be collecting money in enrolment
fees . Instead the only people knocking on our doors are beggars ! This is a Herculean task ,  ’ he added . 
 ‘ I can ’ t take any more !  ’ 
By this time the two former friends were hardly speaking to each other and had to call in local
elders to mediate . My father was desperate not to give up the school so agreed to pay Naeem a return
on his share of the investment . He had no idea how . Fortunately another old college friend called
Hidayatullah stepped in and agreed to put up the money and take Naeem ’ s place . The new partners
again went from door to door , telling people they had started a new kind of school . My father is so
charismatic that Hidayatullah says he is the kind of person who , if invited to your house , will make
friends with your friends . But while people were happy to talk to him , they preferred to send their
children to established schools . 
They named it the Khushal School after one of my father ’ s great heroes , Khushal Khan Khattak , the
warrior poet fromAkora just south of Swat , who tried to unify all Pashtun tribes against the Moghuls
in the seventeenth century . Near the entrance they painted a motto : WE ARE COMMITTED TO BUILD FOR
YOU THE CALL OF THE NEW ERA . My father also designed a shield with a famous quote from Khattak in
Pashto :  ‘ I girt my sword in the name of Afghan honour .  ’ My father wanted us to be inspired by our
great hero , but in a manner fit for our times – with pens , not swords . Just as Khattak had wanted the
Pashtuns to unite against a foreign enemy , so we needed to unite against ignorance . 
Unfortunately not many people were convinced . When the school opened they had just three
students . Even so my father insisted on starting the day in style by singing the national anthem . Then
his nephew Aziz , who had come to help , raised the Pakistan flag . 
With so few students , they had little money to equip the school and soon ran out of credit . Neither
man could get any money from their families , and Hidayatullah was not pleased to discover that my
father was still in debt to lots of people from college , so they were always receiving letters
demanding money . 
There was worse in store when my father went to register the school . After being made to wait for
hours , he was finally ushered into the office of a superintendent of schools , who sat behind towering
piles of files surrounded by hangers-on drinking tea .  ‘ What kind of school is this ?  ’ asked the official , 
laughing at his application .  ‘ How many teachers do you have ? Three ! Your teachers are not trained . 
Everyone thinks they can open a school just like that !  ’ 
The other people in the office laughed along , ridiculing him . My father was angry . It was clear the
superintendent wanted money . Pashtuns cannot stand anyone belittling them , nor was he about to pay a
bribe for something he was entitled to . He and Hidayatullah hardly had money to pay for food , let
alone bribes . The going rate for registration was about 13 , 000 rupees , more if they thought you were
rich . And schools were expected to treat officials regularly to a good lunch of chicken or trout from
the river . The education officer would call to arrange an inspection then give a detailed order for his
lunch . My father used to grumble ,  ‘ We ’ re a school not a poultry farm .  ’ 
So when the official angled for a bribe , my father turned on him with all the force of his years of
debating .  ‘ Why are you asking all these questions ?  ’ he demanded .  ‘ Am I in an office or am I in a
police station or a court ? Am I a criminal ?  ’ He decided to challenge the officials to protect other
school owners from such bullying and corruption . He knew that to do this he needed some power of
his own , so he joined an organisation called the Swat Association of Private Schools . It was small in
those days , just fifteen members , and my father quickly became vice president . 
The other principals took paying bribes for granted , but my father argued that if all the schools
joined together they could resist .  ‘ Running a school is not a crime ,  ’ he told them .  ‘ Why should you be
paying bribes ? You are not running brothels ; you are educating children ! Government officials are not
your bosses ,  ’ he reminded them ;  ‘ they are your servants . They are taking salaries and have to serve
you . You are the ones educating their children .  ’ 
He soon became president of the organisation and expanded it until it included 400 principals . 
Suddenly the school owners were in a position of power . But my father has always been a romantic
rather than a businessman and in the meantime he and Hidayatullah were in such desperate straits that
they ran out of credit with the local shopkeeper and could not even buy tea or sugar . To try and boost
their income they ran a tuck shop at school , going off in the mornings and buying snacks to sell to the
children . My father would buy maize and stay up late at night making and bagging popcorn . 
 ‘ I would get very depressed and sometimes collapse seeing the problems all around us ,  ’ said
Hidayatullah ,  ‘ but when Ziauddin is in a crisis he becomes strong and his spirits high .  ’ 
My father insisted that they needed to think big . One day Hidayatullah came back from trying to
enrol pupils to find my father sitting in the office talking about advertising with the local head of
Pakistan TV . As soon as the man had gone , Hidayatullah burst into laughter .  ‘ Ziauddin , we don ’ t even
have a TV ,  ’ he pointed out .  ‘ If we advertise we won ’ t be able to watch it .  ’ But my father is an
optimistic man and never deterred by practicalities . 
One day my father told Hidayatullah he was going back to his village for a few days . He was
actually getting married , but he didn ’ t tell any of his friends in Mingora as he could not afford to
entertain them . Our weddings go on for several days of feasting . In fact , as my mother often reminds
my father , he was not present for the actual ceremony . He was only there for the last day , when family
members held a Quran and a shawl over their heads and held a mirror for them to look into . For many
couples in arranged marriages this is the first time they see each other ’ s faces . A small boy was
brought to sit on their laps to encourage the birth of a son . 
It is our tradition for the bride to receive furniture or perhaps a fridge from her family and some
gold from the groom ’ s family . My grandfather would not buy enough gold so my father had to borrow
more money to buy bangles . After the wedding my mother moved in with my grandfather and my
uncle . My father returned to the village every two or three weeks to see her . The plan was to get his
school going then , once it was successful , send for his wife . But Baba kept complaining about the
drain on his income and made my mother ’ s life miserable . She had a little money of her own so they
used it to hire a van and she moved to Mingora . They had no idea how they would manage .  ‘ We just
knew my father didn ’ t want us there ,  ’ said my father .  ‘ At that time I was unhappy with my family , but
later I was grateful as it made me more independent .  ’ 
He had however neglected to tell his partner . Hidayatullah was horrified when my father returned
to Mingora with a wife .  ‘ We ’ re not in a position to support a family ,  ’ he told my father .  ‘ Where will
she live ?  ’ 
 ‘ It ’ s OK ,  ’ replied my father .  ‘ She will cook and wash for us .  ’ 
My mother was excited to be in Mingora . To her it was a modern town . When she and her friends
had discussed their dreams as young girls by the river , most had just said they wanted to marry and
have children and cook for their husbands . When it was my mother ’ s turn she said ,  ‘ I want to live in
the city and be able to send out for kebabs and naan instead of cooking it myself .  ’ However , life
wasn ’ t quite what she expected . The shack had just two rooms , one where Hidayatullah and my father
slept and one which was a small office . There was no kitchen , no plumbing . When my mother arrived , 
Hidayatullah had to move into the office and sleep on a hard wooden chair . 
My father consulted my mother on everything .  ‘ Pekai , help me resolve my confusion on this ’  , he
would say . She even helped whitewash the school walls , holding up the lanterns so they could paint
when the light went off in power cuts . 
 ‘ Ziauddin was a family man and they were unusually close ,  ’ said Hidayatullah .  ‘ While most of us
can ’ t live with our wives , he couldn ’ t be without his .  ’ 
Within a few months my mother was expecting . Their first child , born in 1995 , was a girl and
stillborn .  ‘ I think there was some problem with hygiene in that muddy place ,  ’ says my father .  ‘ I
assumed women could give birth without going to hospital , as my mother and my sisters had in the
village . My mother gave birth to ten children in this way .  ’ 
The school continued to lose money . Months would pass and they could not pay the teachers ’ 
wages or the school rent . The goldsmith kept coming and demanding his money for my mother ’ s
wedding bangles . My father would make him good tea and offer him biscuits in the hope that would
keep him satisfied . Hidayatullah laughed .  ‘ You think he will be happy with tea ? He wants his money .  ’ 
The situation became so dire that my father was forced to sell the gold bangles . In our culture
wedding jewellery is a bond between the couple . Often women sell their jewellery to help set up
their husbands in business or to pay their fares to go abroad . My mother had already offered her
bangles to pay for my father ’ s nephew to go to college , which my father had rashly promised to fund –
fortunately , my father ’ s cousin Jehan Sher Khan had stepped in – and she did not realise the bangles
were only partly paid for . She was then furious when she learned that my father did not get a good
price for them . 
Just when it seemed matters could not get worse , the area was hit by flash floods . There was a day
when it did not stop raining and in the late afternoon there was a warning of flooding . Everyone had to
leave the district . My mother was away and Hidayatullah needed my father to help him move
everything up to the first floor , safe from the fast-rising waters , but he couldn ’ t find him anywhere . He
went outside , shouting ‘ Ziauddin , Ziauddin !  ’ The search almost cost Hidayatullah his life . The narrow
street outside the school was totally flooded and he was soon up to his neck in water . There were live
electric cables hanging loose and swaying in the wind . He watched paralysed with fear as they almost
touched the water . Had they done so , he would have been electrocuted . 
When he finally found my father , he learned that he had heard a woman crying that her husband was
trapped in their house and he had rushed in to save him . Then he helped them save their fridge . 
Hidayatullah was furious .  ‘ You saved this woman ’ s husband but not your own house !  ’ he said .  ‘ Was
it because of the cry of a woman ?  ’ 
When the waters receded , they found their home and school destroyed : their furniture , carpets , 
books , clothes and the audio system entirely caked in thick foul-smelling mud . They had nowhere to
sleep and no clean clothes to change into . Luckily , a neighbour called Mr Aman-ud-din took them in
for the night . It took them a week to clear the debris . They were both away when , ten days later , there
was a second flood and the building again filled with mud . Shortly afterwards they had a visit from an
official of WAPDA , the water and power company , who claimed their meter was rigged and
demanded a bribe . When my father refused , a bill arrived with a large fine . There was no way they
could pay this so my father asked one of his political friends to use his influence . 
It started to feel as though the school was not meant to be , but my father would not give up on his
dream so easily . Besides , he had a family to provide for . I was born on 12 July 1997 . My mother was
helped by a neighbour who had delivered babies before . My father was in the school waiting and
when he heard the news he came running . My mother was worried about telling him he had a daughter
not a son , but he says he looked into my eyes and was delighted . 
 ‘ Malala was a lucky girl ,  ’ says Hidayatullah .  ‘ When she was born our luck changed .  ’ 
But not immediately . On Pakistan ’ s fiftieth anniversary on 14 August 1997 there were parades and
commemorations throughout the country . However , my father and his friends said there was nothing to
celebrate as Swat had only suffered since it had merged with Pakistan . They wore black armbands to
protest , saying the celebrations were for nothing , and were arrested . They had to pay a fine they could
not afford . 
A few months after I was born the three rooms above the school became vacant and we all moved
in . The walls were concrete and there was running water so it was an improvement on our muddy
shack , but we were still very cramped as we were sharing it with Hidayatullah and we almost always
had guests . That first school was a mixed primary school and very small . By the time I was born it
had five or six teachers and around a hundred pupils paying a hundred rupees a month . My father was
teacher , accountant and principal . He also swept the floors , whitewashed the walls and cleaned the
bathrooms . He used to climb up electricity poles to hang banners advertising the school , even though
he was so afraid of heights that when he got to the top of the ladder his feet shook . If the water pump
stopped working , he would go down the well to repair it himself . When I saw him disappear down
there I would cry , thinking he wouldn ’ t come back . After paying the rent and salaries , there was little
money left for food . We drank green tea as we could not afford milk for regular tea . But after a while
the school started to break even and my father began to plan a second school , which he wanted to call
the Malala Education Academy . 
I had the run of the school as my playground . My father tells me even before I could talk I would
toddle into classes and talk as if I was a teacher . Some of the female staff like Miss Ulfat would pick
me up and put me on their lap as if I was their pet or even take me home with them for a while . When
I was three or four I was placed in classes for much older children . I used to sit in wonder , listening
to everything they were being taught . Sometimes I would mimic the teachers . You could say I grew up
in a school . 
As my father had found with Naeem , it is not easy to mix business and friendship . Eventually
Hidayatullah left to start his own school and they divided the students , each taking two of the four
years . They did not tell their pupils as they wanted people to think the school was expanding and had
two buildings . Though Hidayatullah and my father were not speaking at that time , Hidayatullah missed
me so much he used to visit me . 
It was while he was visiting one afternoon in September 2001 that there was a great commotion
and other people started arriving . They said there had been a big attack on a building in New York . 
Two planes had flown into it . I was only four and too young to understand . Even for the adults it was
hard to imagine – the biggest buildings in Swat are the hospital and a hotel , which are two or three
storeys . It seemed very far away . I had no idea what New York and America were . The school was
my world and my world was the school . We did not realise then that 9 / 11 would change our world
too , and would bring war into our valley .

The Village
IN OUR TRADITION on the seventh day of a child ’ s life we have a celebration called Woma ( which
means ‘ seventh ’  ) for family , friends and neighbours to come and admire the newborn . My parents had
not held one for me because they could not afford the goat and rice needed to feed the guests , and my
grandfather would not help them out because I was not a boy . When my brothers came along and Baba
wanted to pay , my father refused as he hadn ’ t done this for me . But Baba was the only grandfather I
had as my mother ’ s father had died before I was born and we became close . My parents say I have
qualities of both grandfathers – humorous and wise like my mother ’ s father and vocal like my father ’ s
father ! Baba had grown soft and white-bearded in his old age and I loved going to visit him in the
village . 
Whenever he saw me he would greet me with a song as he was still concerned about the sad
meaning of my name and wanted to lend some happiness to it :  ‘ Malala Maiwand wala da . Pa tool
jehan ke da khushala da ,  ’ he sang .  ‘ Malala is of Maiwand and she ’ s the happiest person in the whole
world .  ’ 
We always went to the village for the Eid holidays . We would dress in our finest clothes and pile
into the Flying Coach , a minibus with brightly painted panels and jangling chains , and drive north to
Barkana , our family village in Shangla . Eid happens twice a year – Eid ul-Fitr or ‘ Small Eid ’ marks
the end of the Ramadan fasting month , and Eid ul-Azha or ‘ Big Eid ’ commemorates the Prophet
Abraham ’ s readiness to sacrifice his son Ismail to God . The dates of the feasts are announced by a
special panel of clerics who watch for the appearance of the crescent moon . As soon as we heard the
broadcast on the radio , we set off . 
The night before we hardly slept because we were so excited . The journey usually took about five
hours as long as the road had not been washed away by rains or landslides , and the Flying Coach left
early in the morning . We struggled to Mingora bus station , our bags laden with gifts for our family –
embroidered shawls and boxes of rose and pistachio sweets as well as medicine they could not get in
the village . Some people took sacks of sugar and flour , and most of the baggage was tied to the top of
the bus in a towering pile . Then we crammed in , fighting over the window seats even though the panes
were so encrusted with dirt it was hard to see out of them . The sides of Swat buses are painted with
scenes of bright pink and yellow flowers , neon-orange tigers and snowy mountains . My brothers liked
it if we got one with F-16 fighter jets or nuclear missiles , though my father said if our politicians
hadn ’ t spent so much money on building an atomic bomb we might have had enough for schools . 
We drove out of the bazaar , past the grinning red mouth signs for dentists , the carts stacked with
wooden cages crammed with beady-eyed white chickens with scarlet beaks , and jewellery stores
with windows full of gold wedding bangles . The last few shops as we headed north out of Mingora
were wooden shacks that seemed to lean on each other , in front of which were piles of reconditioned
tyres for the bad roads ahead . Then we were on the main road built by the last wali , which follows
the wide Swat River on the left and hugs the cliffs to the right with their emerald mines . Overlooking
the river were tourist restaurants with big glass windows we had never been to . On the road we
passed dusty-faced children bent double with huge bundles of grass on their backs and men leading
flocks of shaggy goats that wandered hither and thither . 
As we drove on , the landscape changed to paddy fields of deep lush green that smelt so fresh and
orchards of apricot and fig trees . Occasionally we passed small marble works over streams which
ran milky white with the discharge of chemicals . This made my father cross .  ‘ Look at what these
criminals are doing to pollute our beautiful valley ,  ’ he always said . The road left the river and wound
up through narrow passes over steep fir-clad heights , higher and higher , until our ears popped . On top
of some of the peaks were ruins where vultures circled , the remains of forts built by the first wali . 
The bus strained and laboured , the driver cursing as trucks overtook us on blind bends with steep
drops below . My brothers loved this , and they would taunt me and my mother by pointing out the
wreckage of vehicles on the mountainside . 
Finally we made it up onto Sky Turn , the gateway to Shangla Top , a mountain pass which feels as if
it ’ s on top of the world . Up there we were higher than the rocky peaks all around us . In the far
distance we could see the snows of Malam Jabba , our ski resort . By the roadside were fresh springs
and waterfalls , and when we stopped for a break and to drink some tea , the air was clean and fragrant
with cedar and pine . We breathed it into our lungs greedily . Shangla is all mountain , mountain , 
mountain and just a small sky . After this the road winds back down for a while then follows the
Ghwurban River and peters out into a rocky track . The only way to cross the river is by rope bridges
or on a pulley system by which people swing themselves across in a metal box . Foreigners call them
suicide bridges but we loved them . 
If you look at a map of Swat you ’ ll see it is one long valley with little valleys we call darae off to the
sides like the branches of a tree . Our village lies about halfway along on the east . It ’ s in the Kana
dara , which is enclosed by craggy mountain walls and so narrow there is not even room for a cricket
ground . We call our village Shahpur , but really there is a necklace of three villages along the bottom
of the valley – Shahpur , the biggest ; Barkana , where my father grew up ; and Karshat , which is where
my mother lived . At either end is a huge mountain – Tor Ghar , the Black Mountain to the south , and
Spin Ghar , the White Mountain , to the north . 
We usually stayed in Barkana at my grandfather ’ s house , where my father grew up . Like almost all
the houses in the area , it was flat-roofed and made of stone and mud . I preferred staying in Karshat
with my cousins on my maternal side because they had a concrete house with a bathroom and there
were lots of children to play with . My mother and I stayed in the women ’ s quarters downstairs . The
women spent their days looking after the children and preparing food to serve to the men in their
hujra upstairs . I slept with my cousins Aneesa and Sumbul in a room which had a clock in the shape
of a mosque and a cabinet on the wall containing a rifle and some packets of hair dye . 
In the village the day started early and even I , who liked to sleep late , woke with the sound of
cocks crowing and the clatter of dishes as the women prepared breakfast for the men . In the morning
the sun reflected off the top of Tor Ghar ; when we got up for the fajr prayers , the first of our five
daily prayers , we would look left and see the golden peak of Spin Ghar lit with the first rays of the
sun like a white lady wearing a jumar tika – a gold chain on her forehead . 
Often rain would then come to wash everything clean , and the clouds would linger on the green
terraces of the hills where people grew radishes and walnut trees . Dotted around were hives of bees . 
I loved the gloopy honey , which we ate with walnuts . Down on the river at the Karshat end were
water buffaloes . There was also a shed with a wooden waterwheel providing power to turn huge
millstones to grind wheat and maize into flour , which young boys would then pour into sacks . Next to
that was a smaller shed containing a panel with a confusion of wires sprouting from it . The village
received no electricity from the government so many villagers got their power from these makeshift
hydroelectric projects . 
As the day went on and the sun climbed higher in the sky , more and more of the White Mountain
would be bathed in golden sun . Then as evening came it fell in shadow as the sun moved up the Black
Mountain . We timed our prayers by the shadow on the mountains . When the sun hit a certain rock , we
used to say our asr or afternoon prayers . Then in the evening , when the white peak of Spin Ghar was
even more beautiful than in the morning , we said the makkam or evening prayers . You could see the
White Mountain from everywhere , and my father told me he used to think of it as a symbol of peace
for our land , a white flag at the end of our valley . When he was a child he thought this small valley
was the entire world and that if anyone went beyond the point where either mountain kissed the sky , 
they would fall off . 
Though I had been born in a city , I shared my father ’ s love of nature . I loved the rich soil , the
greenness of the plants , the crops , the buffaloes and the yellow butterflies that fluttered about me as I
walked . The village was very poor , but when we arrived our extended family would lay on a big
feast . There would be bowls of chicken , rice , local spinach and spicy mutton , all cooked over the fire
by the women , followed by plates of crunchy apples , slices of yellow cake and a big kettle of milky
tea . None of the children had toys or books . The boys played cricket in a gully and even the ball was
made from plastic bags tied together with elastic bands . 
The village was a forgotten place . Water was carried from the spring . The few concrete houses had
been built by families whose sons or fathers had gone south to work in the mines or to the Gulf , from
where they sent money home . There are forty million of us Pashtuns , of which ten million live outside
our homeland . My father said it was sad that they could never return as they needed to keep working
to maintain their families ’ new lifestyle . There were many families with no men . They would visit
only once a year , and usually a new baby would arrive nine months later . 
Scattered up and down the hills there were houses made of wattle and daub , like my grandfather ’ s , 
and these often collapsed when there were floods . Children sometimes froze to death in winter . There
was no hospital . Only Shahpur had a clinic , and if anyone fell ill in the other villages they had to be
carried there by their relatives on a wooden frame which we jokingly called the Shangla Ambulance . 
If it was anything serious they would have to make the long bus journey to Mingora unless they were
lucky enough to know someone with a car . 
Usually politicians only visited during election time , promising roads , electricity , clean water and
schools and giving money and generators to influential local people we called stakeholders , who
would instruct their communities on how to vote . Of course this only applied to the men ; women in
our area don ’ t vote . Then they disappeared off to Islamabad if they were elected to the National
Assembly , or Peshawar for the Provincial Assembly , and we ’ d hear no more of them or their
promises . 
My cousins made fun of me for my city ways . I did not like going barefoot . I read books and I had a
different accent and used slang expressions from Mingora . My clothes were often from shops and not
home-made like theirs . My relatives would ask me ,  ‘ Would you like to cook chicken for us ?  ’ and I ’ d
say ,  ‘ No , the chicken is innocent . We should not kill her .  ’ They thought I was modern because I came
from town . They did not realise people from Islamabad or even Peshawar would think me very
backward . 
Sometimes we went up to the mountains and sometimes down to the river on family trips . It was a
big stream , too deep and fast to cross when the snows melted in summer . The boys would fish using
earthworms threaded like beads on a string hanging from a long stick . Some of them whistled , 
believing this would attract the fish . They weren ’ t particularly tasty fish . Their mouths were very
rough and horny . We called them chaqwartee . Sometimes a group of girls would go down to the river
for a picnic with pots of rice and sherbet . Our favourite game was ‘ weddings ’  . We would get into
two groups , each supposed to be a family , then each family would have to betroth a girl so we could
perform a marriage ceremony . Everyone wanted me in their family as I was from Mingora and
modern . The most beautiful girl was Tanzela , and we often gave her to the other group so we could
then have her as our bride . 
The most important part of the mock wedding was jewellery . We took earrings , bangles and
necklaces to decorate the bride , singing Bollywood songs as we worked . Then we would put make-up
on her face that we ’ d taken from our mothers , dip her hands in hot limestone and soda to make them
white , and paint her nails red with henna . Once she was ready , the bride would start crying and we
would stroke her hair and try to convince her not to worry .  ‘ Marriage is part of life ,  ’ we said .  ‘ Be
kind to your mother-in-law and father-in-law so they treat you well . Take care of your husband and be
happy .  ’ 
Occasionally there would be real weddings with big feasts which went on for days and left the
family bankrupt or in debt . The brides would wear exquisite clothes and be draped in gold , necklaces
and bangles given by both sides of the family . I read that Benazir Bhutto insisted on wearing glass
bangles at her wedding to set an example but the tradition of adorning the bride still continued . 
Sometimes a plywood coffin would be brought back from one of the mines . The women would gather
at the house of the dead man ’ s wife or mother and a terrible wailing would start and echo round the
valley , which made my skin crawl . 
At night the village was very dark with just oil lamps twinkling in houses on the hills . None of the
older women had any education but they all told stories and recited what we call tapey , Pashto
couplets . My grandmother was particularly good at them . They were usually about love or being a
Pashtun .  ‘ No Pashtun leaves his land of his own sweet will ,  ’ she would say .  ‘ Either he leaves from
poverty or he leaves for love .  ’ Our aunts scared us with ghost stories , like the one about Shalgwatay , 
the twenty-fingered man , who they warned would sleep in our beds . We would cry in terror , though in
fact as ‘ toe ’ and ‘ finger ’ in Pashto is the same , we were all twenty-fingered , but we didn ’ t realise . To
make us wash , our aunts told stories about a scary woman called Shashaka , who would come after
you with her muddy hands and stinking breath if you didn ’ t take a bath or wash your hair , and turn you
into a dirty woman with hair like rats ’ tails filled with insects . She might even kill you . In the winter
when parents didn ’ t want their children to stay outside in the snow they would tell the story about the
lion or tiger which must always make the first step in the snow . Only when the lion or tiger has left
their footprint were we allowed to go outside . 
As we got older the village began to seem boring . The only television was in the hujra of one of
the wealthier families , and no one had a computer . 
Women in the village hid their faces whenever they left their purdah quarters and could not meet or
speak to men who were not their close relatives . I wore more fashionable clothes and didn ’ t cover my
face even when I became a teenager . One of my male cousins was angry and asked my father ,  ‘ Why
isn ’ t she covered ?  ’ He replied ,  ‘ She ’ s my daughter . Look after your own affairs .  ’ But some of the
family thought people would gossip about us and say we were not properly following Pashtunwali . 
I am very proud to be a Pashtun but sometimes I think our code of conduct has a lot to answer for , 
particularly where the treatment of women is concerned . A woman named Shahida who worked for us
and had three small daughters , told me that when she was only ten years old her father had sold her to
an old man who already had a wife but wanted a younger one . When girls disappeared it was not
always because they had been married off . There was a beautiful fifteen-year-old girl called Seema . 
Everyone knew she was in love with a boy , and sometimes he would pass by and she would look at
him from under her long dark lashes , which all the girls envied . In our society for a girl to flirt with
any man brings shame on the family , though it ’ s all right for the man . We were told she had committed
suicide , but we later discovered her own family had poisoned her . 
We have a custom called swara by which a girl can be given to another tribe to resolve a feud . It is
officially banned but still continues . In our village there was a widow called Soraya who married a
widower from another clan which had a feud with her family . Nobody can marry a widow without the
permission of her family . When Soraya ’ s family found out about the union they were furious . They
threatened the widower ’ s family until a jirga was called of village elders to resolve the dispute . The
jirga decided that the widower ’ s family should be punished by handing over their most beautiful girl
to be married to the least eligible man of the rival clan . The boy was a good-for-nothing , so poor that
the girl ’ s father had to pay all their expenses . Why should a girl ’ s life be ruined to settle a dispute she
had nothing to do with ? 
When I complained about these things to my father he told me that life was harder for women in
Afghanistan . The year before I was born a group called the Taliban led by a one-eyed mullah had
taken over the country and was burning girls ’ schools . They were forcing men to grow beards as long
as a lantern and women to wear burqas . Wearing a burqa is like walking inside big fabric shuttlecock
with only a grille to see through and on hot days it ’ s like an oven . At least I didn ’ t have to wear one . 
He said that the Taliban had even banned women from laughing out loud or wearing white shoes as
white was ‘ a colour that belonged to men ’  . Women were being locked up and beaten just for wearing
nail varnish . I shivered when he told me such things . 
I read my books like Anna Karenina and the novels of Jane Austen and trusted in my father ’ s
words :  ‘ Malala is free as a bird .  ’ When I heard stories of the atrocities in Afghanistan I felt proud to
be in Swat .  ‘ Here a girl can go to school ,  ’ I used to say . But the Taliban were just around the corner
and were Pashtuns like us . For me the valley was a sunny place and I couldn ’ t see the clouds
gathering behind the mountains . My father used to say ,  ‘ I will protect your freedom , Malala . Carry on
with your dreams .  ’

Why I Don ’ t Wear Earrings and Pashtuns Don ’ t Say Thank You
BY THE AGE of seven I was used to being top of my class . I was the one who would help other pupils
who had difficulties .  ‘ Malala is a genius girl ,  ’ my class fellows would say . I was also known for
participating in everything – badminton , drama , cricket , art , even singing , though I wasn ’ t much good . 
So when a new girl named Malka-e-Noor joined our class , I didn ’ t think anything of it . Her name
means ‘ Queen of Light ’ and she said she wanted to be Pakistan ’ s first female army chief . Her mother
was a teacher at a different school , which was unusual as none of our mothers worked . To begin with
she didn ’ t say much in class . The competition was always between me and my best friend Moniba , 
who had beautiful writing and presentation , which the examiners liked , but I knew I could beat her on
content . So when we did the end-of-year exams and Malka-e-Noor came first , I was shocked . At
home I cried and cried and had to be comforted by my mother . 
Around that time we moved away from where we had been living on the same street as Moniba to
an area where I didn ’ t have any friends . On our new road there was a girl called Safina , who was a
bit younger than me , and we started to play together . She was a pampered girl who had lots of dolls
and a shoebox full of jewellery . But she kept eyeing up the pink plastic pretend mobile phone my
father had bought me , which was one of the only toys I had . My father was always talking on his
mobile so I loved to copy him and pretend to make calls on mine . One day it disappeared . 
A few days later I saw Safina playing with a phone exactly the same as mine .  ‘ Where did you get
that ?  ’ I asked .  ‘ I bought it in the bazaar ,  ’ she said . 
I realise now she could have been telling the truth but back then I thought , She is doing this to me
and I will do the same to her . I used to go to her house to study , so whenever I was there I would
pocket her things , mostly toy jewellery like earrings and necklaces . It was easy . At first stealing gave
me a thrill , but that did not last long . Soon it became a compulsion . I did not know how to stop . 
One afternoon I came home from school and rushed into the kitchen as usual for a snack .  ‘ Hello , 
Bhabi !  ’ I called .  ‘ I ’ m starving !  ’ There was silence . My mother was sitting on the floor pounding
spices , brightly coloured turmeric and cumin , filling the air with their aroma . Over and over she
pounded . Her eyes would not meet mine . What had I done ? I was very sad and went to my room . 
When I opened my cupboard , I saw that all the things I had taken were gone . I had been caught . 
My cousin Reena came into my room .  ‘ They knew you were stealing ,  ’ she said .  ‘ They were waiting
for you to come clean but you just kept on .  ’ 
I felt a terrible sinking feeling in my stomach . I walked back to my mother with my head bowed . 
 ‘ What you did was wrong , Malala ,  ’ she said .  ‘ Are you trying to bring shame on us that we can ’ t
afford to buy such things ?  ’ 
 ‘ It ’ s not true !  ’ I lied .  ‘ I didn ’ t take them .  ’ 
But she knew I had .  ‘ Safina started it ,  ’ I protested .  ‘ She took the pink phone that Aba bought me .  ’ 
My mother was unmoved .  ‘ Safina is younger than you and you should have taught her better ,  ’ she
said .  ‘ You should have set an example .  ’ 
I started crying and apologised over and over again .  ‘ Don ’ t tell Aba ,  ’ I begged . I couldn ’ t bear for
him to be disappointed in me . It ’ s horrible to feel unworthy in the eyes of your parents . 
It wasn ’ t the first time . When I was little I went to the bazaar with my mother and spotted a pile of
almonds on a cart . They looked so tasty that I couldn ’ t resist grabbing a handful . My mother told me
off and apologised to the cart owner . He was furious and would not be placated . We still had little
money and my mother checked her purse to see what she had .  ‘ Can you sell them to me for ten
rupees ?  ’ she asked .  ‘ No ,  ’ he replied .  ‘ Almonds are very costly .  ’ 
My mother was very upset and told my father . He immediately went and bought the whole lot from
the man and put them in a glass dish . 
 ‘ Almonds are good ,  ’ he said .  ‘ If you eat them with milk just before bed it makes you brainy .  ’ But I
knew he didn ’ t have much money and the almonds in the dish were a reminder of my guilt . I promised
myself I ’ d never do such a thing again . And now I had . My mother took me to say sorry to Safina and
her parents . It was very hard . Safina said nothing about my phone , which didn ’ t seem fair , but I didn ’ t
mention it either . 
Though I felt bad , I was also relieved it was over . Since that day I have never lied or stolen . Not a
single lie nor a single penny , not even the coins my father leaves around the house , which we ’ re
allowed to buy snacks with . I also stopped wearing jewellery because I asked myself , What are these
baubles which tempt me ? Why should I lose my character for a few metal trinkets ? But I still feel
guilty , and to this day I say sorry to God in my prayers . 
My mother and father tell each other everything so Aba soon found out why I was so sad . I could
see in his eyes that I had failed him . I wanted him to be proud of me , like he was when I was
presented with the first-in-year trophies at school . Or the day our kindergarten teacher Miss Ulfat told
him I had written ,  ‘ Only Speak in Urdu ,  ’ on the blackboard for my classmates at the start of an Urdu
lesson so we would learn the language faster . 
My father consoled me by telling me about the mistakes great heroes made when they were
children . He told me that Mahatma Gandhi said ,  ‘ Freedom is not worth having if it does not include
the freedom to make mistakes .  ’ At school we had read stories about Mohammad Ali Jinnah . As a boy
in Karachi he would study by the glow of street lights because there was no light at home . He told
other boys to stop playing marbles in the dust and to play cricket instead so their clothes and hands
wouldn ’ t get dirty . Outside his office my father had a framed copy of a letter written by Abraham
Lincoln to his son ’ s teacher , translated into Pashto . It is a very beautiful letter , full of good advice . 
 ‘ Teach him , if you can , the wonder of books .  .  . But also give him quiet time to ponder the eternal
mystery of birds in the sky , bees in the sun , and the flowers on a green hillside ,  ’ it says .  ‘ Teach him it
is far more honourable to fail than to cheat .  ’ 
I think everyone makes a mistake at least once in their life . The important thing is what you learn
from it . That ’ s why I have problems with our Pashtunwali code . We are supposed to take revenge for
wrongs done to us , but where does that end ? If a man in one family is killed or hurt by another man , 
revenge must be exacted to restore nang . It can be taken by killing any male member of the attacker ’ s
family . Then that family in turn must take revenge . And on and on it goes . There is no time limit . We
have a saying :  ‘ The Pashtun took revenge after twenty years and another said it was taken too soon .  ’ 
We are a people of many sayings . One is ‘ The stone of Pashto does not rust in water ,  ’ which means
we neither forget nor forgive . That ’ s also why we rarely say thank you , manana , because we believe
a Pashtun will never forget a good deed and is bound to reciprocate at some point , just as he will a
bad one . Kindness can only be repaid with kindness . It can ’ t be repaid with expressions like ‘ thank
you ’  . 
Many families live in walled compounds with watchtowers so they can keep an eye out for their
enemies . We knew many victims of feuds . One was Sher Zaman , a man who had been in my father ’ s
class and always got better grades than him . My grandfather and uncle used to drive my father mad , 
teasing him ,  ‘ You ’ re not as good as Sher Zaman ,  ’ so much he once wished that rocks would come
down the mountain and flatten him . But Sher Zaman did not go to college and ended up becoming a
dispenser in the village pharmacy . His family became embroiled in a dispute with their cousins over
a small plot of forest . One day , as Sher Zaman and two of his brothers were on their way to the land , 
they were ambushed by his uncle and some of his men . All three brothers were killed . 
As a respected man in the community , my father was often called on to mediate feuds . He did not
believe in badal – revenge – and would try to make people see that neither side had anything to gain
from continuing the violence , and it would be better for them to get on with their lives . There were
two families in our village he could not convince . They had been locked in a feud for so long no one
even seemed to remember how it had started – probably some small slight as we are a hot-headed
people . First a brother on one side would attack an uncle on the other . Then vice versa . It consumed
their lives . 
Our people say it is a good system , and our crime rate is much lower than in non-Pashtun areas . But
I think that if someone kills your brother , you shouldn ’ t kill them or their brother , you should teach
them instead . I am inspired by Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan , the man who some call the Frontier Gandhi , 
who introduced a non-violent philosophy to our culture . 
It ’ s the same with stealing . Some people , like me , get caught and vow they will never do it again . 
Others say ,  ‘ Oh it ’ s no big deal – it was just a little thing .  ’ But the second time they will steal
something bigger and the third something bigger still . In my country too many politicians think nothing
of stealing . They are rich and we are a poor country yet they loot and loot . Most of them don ’ t pay tax , 
but that ’ s the least of it . They take out loans from state banks but they don ’ t pay them back . They get
kickbacks on government contracts from friends or the companies they award them to . Many of them
own expensive flats in London . 
I don ’ t know how they can live with their consciences when they see our people going hungry or
sitting in the darkness of endless power cuts , or children unable to go to school as their parents need
them to work . My father says that Pakistan has been cursed with more than its fair share of politicians
who only think about money . They don ’ t care if the army is actually flying the plane , they are happy to
stay out of the cockpit and sit in business class , close the curtains and enjoy the fine food and service
while the rest of us are squashed in economy . 
I had been born into a sort of democracy in which for ten years Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif
kept replacing each other , none of their governments ever completing a term and always accusing
each other of corruption . But two years after I was born the generals again took over . It happened in a
manner so dramatic that it sounds like something out of a movie . Nawaz Sharif was prime minister at
the time and had fallen out with his army chief General Pervez Musharraf and sacked him . At the time
General Musharraf was on a plane of our national airline PIA coming back from Sri Lanka . Nawaz
Sharif was so worried about his reaction that he tried to stop the plane from landing in Pakistan . He
ordered Karachi airport to switch off its landing lights and to park fire engines on the runway to block
the plane even though it had 200 other passengers on board and not enough fuel to get to another
country . Within an hour of the announcement on television of Musharraf ’ s sacking , tanks were on the
streets and troops had taken over the newsrooms and the airports . The local commander , General
Iftikhar , stormed the control tower at Karachi so that Musharraf ’ s plane could land . Musharraf then
seized power and threw Sharif into a dungeon in Attock Fort . Some people celebrated by handing out
sweets as Sharif was unpopular , but my father cried when he heard the news . He had thought we were
done with military dictatorships . Sharif was accused of treason and only saved by his friends in the
Saudi royal family , who arranged his exile . 
Musharraf was our fourth military ruler . Like all our dictators , he started by addressing the nation
on TV , beginning ,  ‘ Mere aziz hamwatano ’ – ‘ My dear countrymen ’ – then went into a long tirade
against Sharif , saying that under him Pakistan had ‘ lost our honour , dignity and respect ’  . He vowed to
end corruption and go after those ‘ guilty of plundering and looting the national wealth ’  . He promised
he would make his own assets and tax return public . He said he would only run the country for a short
time , but no one believed him . General Zia had promised to be in power for ninety days and had
stayed more than eleven years until he was killed in an air crash . 
It ’ s the same old story , my father said , and he was right . Musharraf promised to end the old feudal
system by which the same few dozen families controlled our entire country , and bring fresh young
clean faces into politics . Instead his cabinet was made up of the very same old faces . Once again our
country was expelled from the Commonwealth and became an international black sheep . The
Americans had already suspended most aid the year before when we conducted nuclear tests , but now
almost everyone boycotted us . 
With such a history , you can see why the people of Swat did not always think it was a good idea to
be part of Pakistan . Every few years Pakistan sent us a new deputy commissioner , or DC , to govern
Swat , just as the British had done in colonial days . It seemed to us that these bureaucrats came to our
province simply to get rich , then went back home . They had no interest in developing Swat . Our
people are used to being subservient because under the wali no criticism was tolerated . If anyone
offended him , their entire family could be expelled from Swat . So when the DCs came from Pakistan , 
they were the new kings and no one questioned them . Older people often looked back nostalgically to
the days of the last wali . Back then , they said , the mountains were all still covered in trees , there were
schools every five kilometres and the wali sahib would visit them in person to resolve problems . 
After what happened with Safina , I vowed that I would never treat a friend badly again . My father
always says it ’ s important to treat friends well . When he was at college and had no money for food or
books many of his friends helped him out and he never forgot that . I have three good friends – Safina
from my area , Sumbul from the village and Moniba from school . Moniba had become my best friend
in primary school when we lived near each other , and I persuaded her to come to our school . She is a
wise girl , though we often fall out , particularly when we go on school trips . She comes from a large
family with three sisters and four brothers . I think of her as my big sister even though I am six months
older than her . Moniba sets down rules which I try to follow . We don ’ t have secrets from each other
and we don ’ t share our secrets with anyone else . She doesn ’ t like me talking to other girls and says
we must be careful of associating with people who are badly behaved or have a reputation for
trouble . She always says ,  ‘ I have four brothers , and if I do even the slightest thing wrong they can stop
me going to school .  ’ 
I was so eager not to disappoint my parents that I ran errands for anyone . One day our neighbours
asked me to buy some maize for them from the bazaar . On the way a boy on a bicycle crashed into me
and my left shoulder hurt so much that my eyes watered . But I still went and bought the maize , took it
to my neighbours and then went home . Only then did I cry . Shortly after that I found the perfect way to
try to win back the respect of my father . Notices had gone up at school for a public speaking
competition and Moniba and I both decided to enter . I remembered the story of my father surprising
my grandfather and longed to do the same . 
When we got the topic , I couldn ’ t believe my eyes . It was ‘ Honesty is the best policy ’  . 
The only practice we ’ d had was reading out poems at morning assembly , but there was an older
girl at school called Fatima who was a very good speaker . She was beautiful and spoke in an
animated way . She could speak confidently in front of hundreds of people and they would hang on her
every word . Moniba and I longed to be like her and studied her carefully . 
In our culture speeches are usually written by our fathers , uncles or teachers . They tend to be in
English or Urdu , not in our native Pashto . We thought speaking in English meant you were more
intelligent . We were wrong , of course . It does not matter what language you choose , the important
thing is the words you use to express yourself . Moniba ’ s speech was written by one of her older
brothers . She quoted beautiful poems by Allama Iqbal , our national poet . My father wrote my speech . 
In it he argued that if you want to do good , but do it in a bad way , that ’ s still bad . In the same way , if
you choose a good method to do something bad it ’ s still bad . He ended it with Lincoln ’ s words :  ‘ it is
far more honourable to fail than to cheat ’  . 
On the day only eight or nine boys and girls turned up . Moniba spoke well – she was very
composed and her speech was more emotional and poetic than mine , though mine might have had the
better message . I was so nervous before the speech , I was trembling with fear . My grandfather had
come to watch and I knew he really wanted me to win the competition , which made me even more
nervous . I remembered what my father had said about taking a deep breath before starting , but then I
saw that all eyes were on me and I rushed through . I kept losing my place as the pages danced in my
shaking hands , but as I ended with Lincoln ’ s words , I looked up at my father . He was smiling . 
When the judges announced the results at the end , Moniba had won . I came second . 
It didn ’ t matter . Lincoln also wrote in the letter to his son ’ s teacher ,  ‘ Teach him how to gracefully
lose .  ’ I was used to coming top of my class . But I realised that , even if you win three or four times , 
the next victory will not necessarily be yours without trying – and also that sometimes it ’ s better to
tell your own story . I started writing my own speeches and changing the way I delivered them , from
my heart rather than from a sheet of paper .

Children of the Rubbish Mountain
AS THE KHUSHAL School started to attract more pupils , we moved again and finally had a television . 
My favourite programme was Shaka Laka Boom Boom , an Indian children ’ s series about a boy called
Sanju who has a magic pencil . Everything he drew became real . If he drew a vegetable or a
policeman , the vegetable or policeman would magically appear . If he accidentally drew a snake he
could erase it and the snake would disappear . He used his pencil to help people – he even saved his
parents from gangsters – and I wanted that magic pencil more than anything else in the world . 
At night I would pray ,  ‘ God , give me Sanju ’ s pencil . I won ’ t tell anyone . Just leave it in my
cupboard . I will use it to make everyone happy .  ’ As soon as I finished praying , I would check the
drawer . The pencil was never there , but I knew who I would help first . Just along the street from our
new house was an abandoned strip of land that people used as a rubbish dump – there is no rubbish
collection in Swat . Quickly , it became a rubbish mountain . I didn ’ t like walking near it as it smelt so
bad . Sometimes we would spot rats running through it and crows would circle overhead . 
One day my brothers were not home and my mother had asked me to throw away some potato peel
and eggshells . I wrinkled my nose as I approached , swatting away flies and making sure I didn ’ t step
on anything in my nice shoes . As I threw the rubbish on the mountain of rotting food , I saw something
move and I jumped . It was a girl about my age . Her hair was matted and her skin was covered in
sores . She looked like I imagined Shashaka , the dirty woman they told us about in tales in the village
to make us wash . The girl had a big sack and was sorting rubbish into piles , one for cans , one for
bottle tops , another for glass and another for paper . Nearby there were boys fishing in the pile for
metal using magnets on strings . I wanted to talk to the children but I was too scared . 
That afternoon , when my father came home from school , I told him about the scavenger children
and begged him to go with me to look . He tried to talk to them but they ran away . He explained that
the children would sell what they had sorted to a garbage shop for a few rupees . The shop would then
sell it on at a profit . On the way back home I noticed that he was in tears . 
 ‘ Aba , you must give them free places at your school ,  ’ I begged . He laughed . My mother and I had
already persuaded him to give free places to a number of girls . 
Though my mother was not educated , she was the practical one in the family , the doer while my
father was the talker . She was always out helping people . My father would get angry sometimes – he
would arrive home at lunchtime and call out ,  ‘ Tor Pekai , I ’ m home !  ’ only to find she was out and
there was no lunch for him . Then he would find she was at the hospital visiting someone who was ill , 
or had gone to help a family , so he could not stay cross . Sometimes though she would be out because
she was shopping for clothes in the Cheena Bazaar , and that would be a different matter . 
Wherever we lived my mother filled our house with people . I shared my room with my cousin
Aneesa from the village , who had come to live with us so she could go to school , and a girl called
Shehnaz whose mother Sultana had once worked in our house . Shehnaz and her sister had also been
sent out to collect garbage after their father had died leaving them very poor . One of her brothers was
mentally ill and was always doing strange things like setting fire to their clothes or selling the electric
fan we gave them to keep cool . Sultana was very short-tempered and my mother did not like having
her in the house , but my father arranged a small allowance for her and a place for Shehnaz and her
other brother at his school . Shehnaz had never been to school , so even though she was two years older
than me she was put two classes below , and she came to live with us so that I could help her . 
There was also Nooria , whose mother Kharoo did some of our washing and cleaning , and Alishpa , 
one of the daughters of Khalida , the woman who helped my mother with the cooking . Khalida had
been sold into marriage to an old man who used to beat her , and eventually she ran away with her
three daughters . Her own family would not take her back because it is believed that a woman who has
left her husband has brought shame on her family . For a while her daughters also had to collect
rubbish to survive . Her story was like something out of the novels I had started reading . 
The school had expanded a lot by then and had three buildings – the original one in Landikas was a
primary school , and then there was a high school for girls on Yahya Street and one for boys with a big
garden of roses near the remains of the Buddhist temple . We had about 800 students in total , and
although the school was not really making money , my father gave away more than a hundred free
places . One of them was to a boy whose father , Sharafat Ali , had helped my father when he was a
penniless college student . They were friends from the village . Sharafat Ali worked at the electricity
company and he would give my father a few hundred rupees whenever he could spare them . My father
was happy to be able to repay his kindness . Another was a girl in my class called Kausar , whose
father embroidered clothes and shawls – a trade our region is famous for . When we went on school
trips to visit the mountains , I knew she couldn ’ t afford them so I would pay for her with my pocket
money . 
Giving places to poor children didn ’ t just mean my father lost their fees . Some of the richer parents
took their children out of the school when they realised they were sharing classrooms with the sons
and daughters of people who cleaned their houses or stitched their clothes . They thought it was
shameful for their children to mix with those from poor families . My mother said it was hard for the
poor children to learn when they were not getting enough food at home so some of the girls would
come to our house for breakfast . My father joked that our home had become a boarding house . 
Having so many people around made it hard to study . I had been delighted to have my own room , 
and my father had even bought me a dressing table to work on . But now I had two other girls in the
room .  ‘ I want space !  ’ I ’ d cry . But then I felt guilty as I knew we were lucky . I thought back to the
children working on the rubbish heap . I kept seeing the dirty face of the girl from the dump and
continued to pester my father to give them places at our school . 
He tried to explain that those children were breadwinners so if they went to school , even for free , 
the whole family would go hungry . However , he got a wealthy philanthropist , Azaday Khan , to pay
for him to produce a leaflet asking ,  ‘ Kia hasool e elum in bachun ka haq nahe ?  ’ – ‘ Is education not
the right of these children ?  ’ My father printed thousands of these leaflets , left them at local meetings
and distributed them around town . 
By then my father was becoming a well-known figure in Swat . Even though he was not a khan or a
rich man , people listened to him . They knew he would have something interesting to say at workshops
and seminars and wasn ’ t afraid to criticise the authorities , even the army , which was now running our
country . He was becoming known to the army too , and friends told him that the local commander had
called him ‘ lethal ’ in public . My father didn ’ t know what exactly the brigadier meant , but in our
country , where the army is so powerful , it did not bode well . 
One of his pet hates was the ‘ ghost schools ’  . Influential people in remote areas took money from
the government for schools which never saw a single pupil . Instead they used the buildings for their
hujras or even to keep their animals . There was even a case of a man drawing a teacher ’ s pension
when he had never taught a day in his life . Aside from corruption and bad government , my father ’ s
main concern in those days was the environment . Mingora was expanding quickly – around 175 , 000
people now called it home – and our once-fresh air was becoming very polluted from all the vehicles
and cooking fires . The beautiful trees on our hills and mountains were being chopped down for
timber . My father said only around half the town ’ s population had access to safe drinking water and
most , like us , had no sanitation . So he and his friends set up something called the Global Peace
Council which , despite its name , had very local concerns . The name was ironic and my father often
laughed about it , but the organisation ’ s aim was serious : to preserve the environment of Swat and
promote peace and education among local people . 
My father also loved to write poetry , sometimes about love , but often on controversial themes such
as honour killings and women ’ s rights . Once he visited Afghanistan for a poetry festival at the Kabul
Intercontinental Hotel , where he read a poem about peace . It was mentioned as the most inspiring in
the closing speech , and some in the audience asked him to repeat whole stanzas and couplets , 
exclaiming ‘ Wah wah ’ when a particular line pleased them , which is a bit like ‘ Bravo ’  . Even my
grandfather was proud .  ‘ Son , may you be the star in the sky of knowledge ,  ’ he used to say . 
We too were proud , but his higher profile meant we didn ’ t see him very much . It was always our
mother who shopped for our clothes and took us to hospital if we were ill , even though in our culture , 
particularly for those of us from villages , a woman is not supposed to do these things alone . So one of
my father ’ s nephews would have to go along . When my father was at home , he and his friends sat on
the roof at dusk and talked politics endlessly . There was really only one subject – 9 / 11 . It might have
changed the whole world but we were living right in the epicentre of everything . Osama bin Laden , 
the leader of al-Qaeda , had been living in Kandahar when the attack on the World Trade Center
happened , and the Americans had sent thousands of troops to Afghanistan to catch him and overthrow
the Taliban regime which had protected him . 
In Pakistan we were still under a dictatorship , but America needed our help , just as it had in the
1980s to fight the Russians in Afghanistan . Just as the Russian invasion of Afghanistan had changed
everything for General Zia , so 9 / 11 transformed General Musharraf from an international outcast . 
Suddenly he was being invited to the White House by George W . Bush and to 10 Downing Street by
Tony Blair . There was a major problem , however . Our own intelligence service , ISI , had virtually
created the Taliban . Many ISI officers were close to its leaders , having known them for years , and
shared some of their beliefs . The ISI ’ s Colonel Imam boasted he had trained 90 , 000 Taliban fighters
and even became Pakistan ’ s consul general in Herat during the Taliban regime . 
We were not fans of the Taliban as we had heard they destroyed girls ’ schools and blew up giant
Buddha statues – we had many Buddhas of our own that we were proud of . But many Pashtuns did not
like the bombing of Afghanistan or the way Pakistan was helping the Americans , even if it was only
by allowing them to cross our airspace and stopping weapons supplies to the Taliban . We did not
know then that Musharraf was also letting the Americans use our airfields . 
Some of our religious people saw Osama bin Laden as a hero . In the bazaar you could buy posters
of him on a white horse and boxes of sweets with his picture on them . These clerics said 9 / 11 was
revenge on the Americans for what they had been doing to other people round the world , but they
ignored the fact that the people in the World Trade Center were innocent and had nothing to do with
American policy and that the Holy Quran clearly says it is wrong to kill . Our people see conspiracies
behind everything , and many argued that the attack was actually carried out by Jews as an excuse for
America to launch a war on the Muslim world . Some of our newspapers printed stories that no Jews
went to work at the World Trade Center that day . My father said this was rubbish . 
Musharraf told our people that he had no choice but to cooperate with the Americans . He said they
had told him ,  ‘ Either you are with us , or you are with the terrorists ,  ’ and threatened to ‘ bomb us back
to the Stone Age ’ if we stood against them . But we weren ’ t exactly cooperating as the ISI was still
arming Taliban fighters and giving their leaders sanctuary in Quetta . They even persuaded the
Americans to let them fly hundreds of Pakistani fighters out of northern Afghanistan . The ISI chief
asked the Americans to hold off their attack on Afghanistan until he had gone to Kandahar to ask the
Taliban leader Mullah Omar to hand over bin Laden ; instead he offered the Taliban help . 
In our province Maulana Sufi Mohammad , who had fought in Afghanistan against the Russians , 
issued a fatwa against the US . He held a big meeting in Malakand , where our ancestors had fought the
British . The Pakistani government didn ’ t stop him . The governor of our province issued a statement
that anyone who wanted to fight in Afghanistan against NATO forces was free to do so . Some 12 , 000
young men from Swat went to help the Taliban . Many never came back . They were most likely killed , 
but as there is no proof of death , their wives can ’ t be declared widows . It ’ s very hard on them . My
father ’ s close friend Wahid Zaman ’ s brother and brother-in-law were among the many who went to
Afghanistan . Their wives and children are still waiting for them . I remember visiting them and feeling
their longing . Even so , it all seemed far , far away from our peaceful garden valley . Afghanistan is less
than a hundred miles away , but to get there you have to go through Bajaur , one of the tribal areas
between Pakistan and the border with Afghanistan . 
Bin Laden and his men fled to the White Mountains of Tora Bora in eastern Afghanistan , where he
had built a network of tunnels while fighting the Russians . They escaped through these and over the
mountains into Kurram , another tribal agency . What we didn ’ t know then was that bin Laden came to
Swat and stayed in a remote village for a year , taking advantage of the Pashtunwali hospitality code . 
Anyone could see that Musharraf was double-dealing , taking American money while still helping
the jihadis – ‘ strategic assets ’  , as the ISI calls them . The Americans say they gave Pakistan billions of
dollars to help their campaign against al-Qaeda but we didn ’ t see a single cent . Musharraf built a
mansion by Rawal Lake in Islamabad and bought an apartment in London . Every so often an important
American official would complain that we weren ’ t doing enough and then suddenly some big fish
would be caught . Khalid Sheikh Mohammad , the mastermind of 9 / 11 , was found in a house just a mile
from the army chief ’ s official residence in Rawalpindi . But President Bush kept praising Musharraf , 
inviting him to Washington and calling him his buddy . My father and his friends were disgusted . They
said the Americans always preferred dealing with dictators in Pakistan . 
From an early age I was interested in politics and sat on my father ’ s knee listening to everything he
and his friends discussed . But I was more concerned with matters closer to home – our own street to
be exact . I told my friends at school about the rubbish-dump children and that we should help . Not
everyone wanted to as they said the children were dirty and probably diseased , and their parents
would not like them going to school with children like that . They also said it wasn ’ t up to us to sort
out the problem . I didn ’ t agree .  ‘ We can sit by and hope the government will help but they won ’ t . If I
can help support one or two children and another family supports one or two then between us we can
help them all .  ’ 
I knew it was pointless appealing to Musharraf . In my experience , if my father couldn ’ t help with
matters like these , there was only one option . I wrote a letter to God .  ‘ Dear God ,  ’ I wrote ,  ‘ I know
you see everything , but there are so many things that maybe , sometimes , things get missed , particularly
now with the bombing in Afghanistan . But I don ’ t think you would be happy if you saw the children on
my road living on a rubbish dump . God , give me strength and courage and make me perfect because I
want to make this world perfect . Malala .  ’ 
The problem was I did not know how to get it to him . Somehow I thought it needed to go deep into
the earth , so first I buried it in the garden . Then I thought it would get spoilt , so I put it in a plastic
bag . But that didn ’ t seem much use . We like to put sacred texts in flowing waters , so I rolled it up , 
tied it to a piece of wood , placed a dandelion on top and floated it in the stream which flows into the
Swat River . Surely God would find it there .

The Mufti Who Tried to Close Our School
JUST IN FRONT of the school on Khushal Street , where I was born , was the house of a tall handsome
mullah and his family . His name was Ghulamullah and he called himself a mufti , which means he is
an Islamic scholar and authority on Islamic law , though my father complains that anyone with a turban
can call themselves a maulana or mufti . The school was doing well , and my father was building an
impressive reception with an arched entrance in the boy ’ s high school . For the first time my mother
could buy nice clothes and even send out for food as she had dreamed of doing back in the village . 
But all this time the mufti was watching . He watched the girls going in and out of our school every
day and became angry , particularly as some of the girls were teenagers .  ‘ That maulana has a bad eye
on us ,  ’ said my father one day . He was right . 
Shortly afterwards the mufti went to the woman who owned the school premises and said , 
 ‘ Ziauddin is running a haram school in your building and bringing shame on the mohalla 
[ neighbourhood ]  . These girls should be in purdah .  ’ He told her ,  ‘ Take this building back from him
and I will rent it for my madrasa . If you do this you will get paid now and also receive a reward in
the next world .  ’ 
She refused and her son came to my father in secret .  ‘ This maulana is starting a campaign against
you ,  ’ he warned .  ‘ We won ’ t give him the building but be careful .  ’ 
My father was angry .  ‘ Just as we say ,  “ Nim hakim khatrai jan ” – “ Half a doctor is a danger to
one ’ s life ,  ” so ,  “ Nim mullah khatrai iman ” – “ A mullah who is not fully learned is a danger to
faith ”  ,  ’ he said . 
I am proud that our country was created as the world ’ s first Muslim homeland , but we still don ’ t
agree on what this means . The Quran teaches us sabar – patience – but often it feels that we have
forgotten the word and think Islam means women sitting at home in purdah or wearing burqas while
men do jihad . We have many strands of Islam in Pakistan . Our founder Jinnah wanted the rights of
Muslims in India to be recognised , but the majority of people in India were Hindu . It was as if there
was a feud between two brothers and they agreed to live in different houses . So British India was
divided in August 1947 , and an independent Muslim state was born . It could hardly have been a
bloodier beginning . Millions of Muslims crossed from India , and Hindus travelled in the other
direction . Almost two million of them were killed trying to cross the new border . Many were
slaughtered on trains which arrived at Lahore and Delhi full of bloodied corpses . My own grandfather
narrowly escaped death in the riots when his train was attacked by Hindus on his way home from
Delhi , where he had been studying . Now we are a country of 180 million and more than 96 per cent
are Muslim . We also have around two million Christians and more than two million Ahmadis , who
say they are Muslims though our government says they are not . Sadly those minority communities are
often attacked . 
Jinnah had lived in London as a young man and trained as a barrister . He wanted a land of
tolerance . Our people often quote the famous speech he made a few days before independence :  ‘ You
are free to go to your temples , you are free to go to your mosques or to any other place of worship in
this State of Pakistan . You may belong to any religion or caste or creed – that has nothing to do with
the business of the state .  ’ My father says the problem is that Jinnah negotiated a piece of real estate
for us but not a state . He died of tuberculosis just a year after the creation of Pakistan and we haven ’ t
stopped fighting since . We have had three wars against India and what seems like endless killing
inside our own country . 
We Muslims are split between Sunnis and Shias – we share the same fundamental beliefs and the
same Holy Quran but we disagree over who was the right person to lead our religion when the
Prophet died in the seventh century . The man chosen to be the leader or caliph was Abu Bakr , a close
friend and adviser of the Prophet and the man he chose to lead prayers as he lay on his deathbed . 
 ‘ Sunni ’ comes from the Arabic for ‘ one who follows the traditions of the Prophet ’  . But a smaller
group believed that leadership should have stayed within the Prophet ’ s family and that Ali , his son-inlaw and cousin , should have taken over . They became known as Shias , shortened from Shia-t-Ali , the
Party of Ali . 
Every year Shias commemorate the killing of the Prophet ’ s grandson Hussein Ibn Ali at the battle
of Karbala in the year 680 with a festival called Muharram . They whip themselves into a bloody
frenzy with metal chains or razor blades on strings until the streets run red . One of my father ’ s friends
is a Shia and he cries whenever he talks about Hussein ’ s death at Karbala . He gets so emotional you
would think the events had happened just the night before , not more than 1 , 300 years ago . Our own
founder , Jinnah , was a Shia , and Benazir Bhutto ’ s mother was also a Shia from Iran . 
Most Pakistanis are Sunnis like us – more than eighty per cent – but within that we are again many
groups . By far the biggest group is the Barelvis , who are named after a nineteenth-century madrasa in
Bareilly , which lies in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh . Then we have the Deobandi , named after
another famous nineteenth-century madrasa in Uttar Pradesh , this time in the village of Deoband . They
are very conservative and most of our madrasas are Deobandi . We also have the Ahl-e-Hadith 
( people of the Hadith )  , who are Salafists . This group is more Arab-influenced and even more
conservative than the others . They are what the West calls fundamentalists . They don ’ t accept our
saints and shrines – many Pakistanis are also mystical people and gather at Sufi shrines to dance and
worship . Each of these strands has many different subgroups . 
The mufti on Khushal Street was a member of Tablighi Jamaat , a Deobandi group that holds a huge
rally every year at its headquarters in Raiwind , near Lahore , attended by millions of people . Our last
dictator General Zia used to go there , and in the 1980s , under his regime , the Tablighis became very
powerful . Many of the imams appointed to preach in army barracks were Tablighis and army officers
would often take leave and go on preaching tours for the group . 
One night , after the mufti had failed to persuade our landlady to cancel our lease , he gathered some
of the influential people and elders of our mohalla into a delegation and turned up at our door . There
were seven people – some other senior Tablighis , a mosque keeper , a former jihadi and a shopkeeper
– and they filled our small house . 
My father seemed worried and shooed us into the other room , but the house was small so we could
hear every word .  ‘ I am representing the Ulema and Tablighian and Taliban ,  ’ Mullah Ghulamullah
said , referring to not just one but two organisations of Muslim scholars to give himself gravitas .  ‘ I am
representing good Muslims and we all think your girls ’ school is haram and a blasphemy . You should
close it . Girls should not be going to school ,  ’ he continued .  ‘ A girl is so sacred she should be in
purdah , and so private that there is no lady ’ s name in the Quran as God doesn ’ t want her to be
named .  ’ 
My father could listen no more .  ‘ Maryam is mentioned everywhere in the Quran . Was she not a
woman and a good woman at that ?  ’ 
 ‘ No ,  ’ said the mullah .  ‘ She is only there to prove that Isa [ Jesus ] was the son of Maryam , not the
son of God !  ’ 
 ‘ That may be ,  ’ replied my father .  ‘ But I am pointing out that the Quran names Maryam .  ’ 
The mufti started to object but my father had had enough . Turning to the group , he said ,  ‘ When this
gentleman passes me on the street , I look to him and greet him but he doesn ’ t answer , he just bows his
head .  ’ 
The mullah looked down embarrassed because greeting someone properly is important in Islam . 
 ‘ You run the haram school ,  ’ he said .  ‘ That ’ s why I don ’ t want to greet you .  ’ 
Then one of the other men spoke up .  ‘ I ’ d heard you were an infidel ,  ’ he said to my father ,  ‘ but there
are Qurans in your room .  ’ 
 ‘ Of course there are !  ’ replied my father , astonished that his faith would be questioned .  ‘ I am a
Muslim .  ’ 
 ‘ Let ’ s get back to the subject of the school ,  ’ said the mufti , who could see the discussion was not
going his way .  ‘ There are men in the reception area of the school , and they see the girls enter , and this
is very bad .  ’ 
 ‘ I have a solution ,  ’ said my father .  ‘ The school has another gate . The girls will enter through that .  ’ 
The mullah clearly wasn ’ t happy as he wanted the school closed altogether . But the elders were
happy with this compromise and they left . 
My father suspected this would not be the end of the matter . What we knew and they didn ’ t was that
the mufti ’ s own niece attended the school in secret . So a few days later my father called the mufti ’ s
elder brother , the girl ’ s father . 
 ‘ I am very tired of your brother ,  ’ he said .  ‘ What kind of mullah is he ? He ’ s driving us crazy . Can
you help to get him off our backs ?  ’ 
 ‘ I ’ m afraid I can ’ t help you , Ziauddin ,  ’ he replied .  ‘ I have trouble in my home too . He lives with us
and has told his wife that she must observe purdah from us and that our wives must observe purdah
from him , all in this small space . Our wives are like sisters to him and his is like a sister to us , but
this madman has made our house a hell . I am sorry but I can ’ t help you .  ’ 
My father was right to think this man was not going to give up – mullahs had become more
powerful figures since Zia ’ s rule and campaign of Islamisation . 
In some ways General Musharraf was very different from General Zia . Though he usually dressed in
uniform , he occasionally wore Western suits and he called himself chief executive instead of chief
martial law administrator . He also kept dogs , which we Muslims regard as unclean . Instead of Zia ’ s
Islamisation he began what he called ‘ enlightened moderation ’  . He opened up our media , allowing
new private TV channels and female newsreaders , as well as showing dancing on television . The
celebration of Western holidays such as Valentine ’ s Day and New Year ’ s Eve was allowed . He even
sanctioned an annual pop concert on the eve of Independence Day , which was broadcast to the nation . 
He did something which our democratic rulers hadn ’ t , even Benazir , and abolished the law that for a
woman to prove she was raped , she had to produce four male witnesses . He appointed the first
woman governor of the state bank and the first women airline pilots and coastguards . He even
announced we would have female guards at Jinnah ’ s tomb in Karachi . 
However in our Pashtun homeland of the North-West Frontier Province things were very different . 
In 2002 Musharraf held elections for ‘ controlled democracy ’  . They were strange elections as the main
party leaders Nawaz Sharif and Benazir Bhutto were in exile . In our province these elections brought
what we called a ‘ mullah government ’ to power . The Muttahida Majlis e-Amal ( MMA ) alliance was
a group of five religious parties including the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam ( JUI )  , which ran the madrasas
where the Taliban were trained . People jokingly referred to the MMA as the Mullah Military
Alliance and said they got elected because they had Musharraf ’ s support . But some people supported
them because the very religious Pashtuns were angry at the American invasion of Afghanistan and the
removal of the Taliban from power there . 
Our area had always been more conservative than most of the rest of Pakistan . During the Afghan
jihad many madrasas had been built , most of them funded by Saudi money , and many young men had
passed through them as it was free education . That was the start of what my father calls the
 ‘ Arabisation ’ of Pakistan . Then 9 / 11 had made this militancy more mainstream . Sometimes when I
walked along the main road I saw chalked messages on the sides of buildings . CONTACT US FOR JIHAD
TRAINING , they would say , listing a phone number to call . In those days jihadi groups were free to do
whatever they wanted . You could see them openly collecting contributions and recruiting men . There
was even a headmaster from Shangla who would boast that his greatest success was to send ten boys
in Grade 9 for jihad training in Kashmir . 
The MMA government banned CD and DVD shops and wanted to create a morality police like the
Afghan Taliban had set up . The idea was they would be able to stop a woman accompanied by a man
and require her to prove that the man was her relative . Thankfully , our supreme court stopped this . 
Then MMA activists launched attacks on cinemas and tore down billboards with pictures of women
or blacked them out with paint . They even snatched female mannequins from clothing shops . They
harassed men wearing Western-style shirts and trousers instead of the traditional shalwar kamiz and
insisted women cover their heads . It was as though they wanted to remove all traces of womankind
from public life . 
My father ’ s high school opened in 2003 . That first year they had boys and girls together , but by
2004 the climate had changed so it was unthinkable to have girls and boys in the same class . That
changing climate made Ghulamullah bold . One of the school clerks told my father that the mufti kept
coming into school and demanding why we girls were still using the main entrance . He said that one
day , when a male member of staff took a female teacher out to the main road to get a rickshaw , the
maulana asked ,  ‘ Why did this man escort her to the road , is he her brother ?  ’ 
 ‘ No ,  ’ replied the clerk ,  ‘ he is a colleague .  ’ 
 ‘ That is wrong !  ’ said the maulana . 
My father told the clerk to call him next time he saw the maulana . When the call came , my father
and the Islamic studies teacher went out to confront him . 
 ‘ Maulana , you have driven me to the wall !  ’ my father said .  ‘ Who are you ? You are crazy ! You
need to go to a doctor . You think I enter the school and take my clothes off ? When you see a boy and a
girl you see a scandal . They are schoolchildren . I think you should go and see Dr Haider Ali !  ’ 
Dr Haider Ali was a well-known psychiatrist in our area , so to say ,  ‘ Shall we take you to Dr
Haider Ali ?  ’ meant ‘ Are you mad ?  ’ 
The mufti went quiet . He took off his turban and put it in my father ’ s lap . For us a turban is a public
symbol of chivalry and Pashtunness , and for a man to lose his turban is considered a great humili–
ation . But then he started up again .  ‘ I never said those things to your clerk . He is lying .  ’ 
My father had had enough .  ‘ You have no business here ,  ’ he shouted .  ‘ Go away !  ’ 
The mufti had failed to close our school but his interference was an indication of how our country
was changing . My father was worried . He and his fellow activists were holding endless meetings . 
These were no longer just about stopping people cutting down trees but were also about education
and democracy . 
In 2004 , after resisting pressure from Washington for more than two and a half years , General
Musharraf sent the army into the Federally Administered Tribal Areas ( FATA )  , seven agencies that
lie along the border with Afghanistan , where the government had little control . The Americans
claimed that al-Qaeda militants who had fled fromAfghanistan during the US bombing were using the
areas as a safe haven , taking advantage of our Pashtun hospitality . From there they were running
training camps and launching raids across the border on NATO troops . For us in Swat this was very
close to home . One of the agencies , Bajaur , is next to Swat . The people who live in the FATA are all
from Pashtun tribes like us Yousafzai , and live on both sides of the border with Afghanistan . 
The tribal agencies were created in British times as a buffer zone between Afghanistan and what
was then India , and they are still run in the same way , administered by tribal chiefs or elders known
as maliks . Unfortunately , the maliks make little difference . In truth the tribal areas are not governed at
all . They are forgotten places of harsh rocky valleys where people scrape by on smuggling .  ( The
average annual income is just $250 – half the Pakistani average .  ) They have very few hospitals and
schools , particularly for girls , and political parties were not allowed there until recently . Hardly any
women from these areas can read . The people are renowned for their fierceness and independence , as
you can see if you read any of the old British accounts . 
Our army had never before gone into the FATA . Instead they had maintained indirect control in the
same way the British had , relying on the Pashtun-recruited Frontier Corps rather than regular soldiers . 
Sending in the regular army was a tough decision . Not only did our army and ISI have long links with
some of the militants , but it also meant our troops would be fighting their own Pashtun brothers . The
first tribal area that the army entered was South Waziristan , in March 2004 . Predictably the local
people saw it as an attack on their way of life . All the men there carry weapons and hundreds of
soldiers were killed when the locals revolted . 
The army was in shock . Some men refused to fight , not wishing to battle their own people . They
retreated after just twelve days and reached what they called a ‘ negotiated peace settlement ’ with
local militant leaders like Nek Mohammad . This involved the army bribing them to halt all attacks
and keep out foreign fighters . The militants simply used the cash to buy more weapons and resumed
their activities . A few months later came the first attack on Pakistan by a US drone . 
On 17 June 2004 an unmanned Predator dropped a Hellfire missile on Nek Mohammad in South
Waziristan apparently while he was giving an interview by satellite phone . He and the men around
him were killed instantly . Local people had no idea what it was – back then we did not know that the
Americans could do such a thing . Whatever you thought about Nek Mohammad , we were not at war
with the Americans and were shocked that they would launch attacks from the sky on our soil . Across
the tribal areas people were angry and many joined militant groups or formed lashkars , local militias . 
Then there were more attacks . The Americans said that bin Laden ’ s deputy Ayman al-Zawahiri was
hiding in Bajaur and had taken a wife there . In January 2006 a drone supposedly targeting him landed
on a village called Damadola , destroying three houses and killing eighteen people . The Americans
said he had been tipped off and escaped . That same year , on 30 October , another US Predator hit a
madrasa on a hill near the main town of Khar , killing eighty-two people , many of them young boys . 
The Americans said it was the al-Qaeda training camp which had featured in the group ’ s videos and
that the hill was riddled with tunnels and gun emplacements . Within a few hours of the attack , an
influential local cleric called Faqir Mohammad , who had run the madrasa , announced that the deaths
would be avenged by suicide bombings against Pakistani soldiers . 
My father and his friends were worried and called together local elders and leaders for a peace
conference . It was a bitterly cold night in January but 150 people gathered . 
 ‘ It ’ s coming here ,  ’ my father warned .  ‘ The fire is reaching the valley . Let ’ s put out the flames of
militancy before they reach here .  ’ 
But no one would listen . Some people even laughed , including a local political leader sitting in the
front row . 
 ‘ Mr Khan ,  ’ my father said to him ,  ‘ you know what happened to the people of Afghanistan . They are
now refugees and they ’ re living with us . The same is happening with Bajaur . The same will happen to
us , mark my words , and we will have no shelter , no place to migrate to .  ’ 
But the expression on the man ’ s face was mocking .  ‘ Look at this man ,  ’ he seemed to be saying of
my father .  ‘ I am a khan . Who would dare kick me out of this area ?  ’ 
My father came home frustrated .  ‘ I have a school , but I am neither a khan nor a political leader . I
have no platform ,  ’ he said .  ‘ I am only one small man .  ’

The Autumn of the Earthquake
ONE FINE OCTOBER day when I was still in primary school our desks started to tremble and shake . 
Our classes were still mixed at that age , and all the boys and girls yelled ,  ‘ Earthquake !  ’ We ran
outside as we had been taught to do . All the children gathered around our teachers as chicks swarm to
a mother hen . 
Swat lies on a geological fault line and we often had earthquakes , but this felt different . All the
buildings around us seemed to be shaking and the rumbling didn ’ t stop . Most of us were crying and
our teachers were praying . Miss Rubi , one of my favourite teachers , told us to stop crying and to stay
calm ; it would soon be over . 
Once the shaking had stopped we were all sent home . We found our mother sitting in a chair
holding the Quran , reciting verses over and over . Whenever there is trouble people pray a lot . She
was relieved to see us and hugged us , tears streaming down her face . But the aftershocks kept coming
all afternoon so we remained very scared . 
We had moved again – we would move seven times by the time I was thirteen – and were living in
an apartment building . It was high for Mingora , two storeys with a big water tank on the roof . My
mother was terrified it would collapse on top of us so we kept going outside . My father did not get
home till late that evening as he had been busy checking all the other school buildings . 
When nightfall came , there were still tremors and my mother was in a state of panic . Every time we
felt a tremor we thought it was the Day of Judgement .  ‘ We will be buried in our beds !  ’ she cried . She
insisted we leave , but my father was exhausted and we Muslims believe our fate is written by God . 
So he put me and my brothers Khushal and Atal , then just a baby , to bed . 
 ‘ Go wherever you want ,  ’ he told my mother and cousin .  ‘ I am staying here . If you believe in God
you will stay here .  ’ I think when there is a great disaster or our lives are in danger we remember our
sins and wonder how we will meet God and whether we will be forgiven . But God has also given us
the power to forget , so that when the tragedy is over we carry on as normal . I trusted in my father ’ s
faith , but I also shared my mother ’ s very real concerns . 
That earthquake of 8 October 2005 turned out to be one of the worst in history . It was 7 . 6 on the
Richter Scale and was felt as far away as Kabul and Delhi . Our town of Mingora was largely spared
– just a few buildings collapsed – but neighbouring Kashmir and the northern areas of Pakistan were
devastated . Even in Islamabad buildings collapsed . 
It took a while for us to realise how bad it was . When the TV news began to show the devastation
we saw that entire villages had been turned to dust . Landslides blocked access to the worst affected
parts and all the phones and power lines were down . The earthquake had affected 30 , 000 square
kilometres , an area as big as the American state of Connecticut . The numbers were unbelievable . 
More than 73 , 000 people had been killed and 128 , 000 injured , many of them permanently disabled . 
Around three and a half million people had lost their homes . Roads , bridges , water and power had all
gone . Places we had visited like Balakot were almost completely destroyed . Many of those killed
were children who like me had been at school that morning . Some 6 , 400 schools were turned to
rubble and 18 , 000 children lost their lives . 
We remembered how scared we had been that morning and started raising money at school . 
Everyone brought what they could . My father went to everybody he knew , asking for donations of
food , clothing and money , and I helped my mother collect blankets . My father raised money from the
Swat Association of Private Schools and the Global Peace Council to add to what we had collected
at school . The total came to more than one million rupees . A publishing company in Lahore which
supplied our schoolbooks sent five trucks of food and other essentials . 
We were terribly worried about our family in Shangla , jammed between those narrow mountains . 
Finally we got news from a cousin . In my father ’ s small village eight people had been killed and
many homes destroyed . One of them was the house of the local cleric , Maulana Khadim , which fell
down crushing his four beautiful daughters . I wanted to go to Shangla with my father and the trucks but
he told me it would be too dangerous . 
When he returned a few days later he was ashen . He told us that the last part of the journey had
been very difficult . Much of the road had collapsed into the river and large boulders had fallen and
blocked the way . Our family and friends said they had thought it was the end of the world . They
described the roar of rocks sliding down hills and everyone running out of their houses reciting the
Quran , the screams as roofs crashed down and the howls of the buffaloes and goats . As the tremors
continued they had spent the entire day outdoors and then the night too , huddling together for warmth , 
even though it was bitterly cold in the mountains . 
To start with the only rescue workers who came were a few from a locally based foreign aid
agency and volunteers from the Tehrike-Nifaz-e-Sharia-e-Mohammadi ( TNSM ) or Movement for the
Enforcement of Islamic Law , the group founded by Sufi Mohammad that had sent men to fight in
Afghanistan . Sufi Mohammad had been in jail since 2002 when Musharraf arrested a number of
militant leaders after American pressure , but his organisation still continued and was being run by his
son-in-law Maulana Fazlullah . It was hard for the authorities to reach places like Shangla because
most of the roads and bridges had gone and local government had been wiped out throughout the
region . We saw an official from the United Nations say on television that it was the ‘ worst logistical
nightmare that the UN had ever faced ’  . 
General Musharraf called it a ‘ test of the nation ’ and announced that the army had set up Operation
Lifeline – our army likes giving their operations names . There were lots of pictures on the news of
army helicopters laden with supplies and tents , but in many of the small valleys the helicopters could
not land and the aid packages they dropped often rolled down slopes into rivers . In some places , 
when the helicopters flew in the locals all rushed underneath them , which meant they could not drop
supplies safely . 
But some aid did get in . The Americans were quick as they had thousands of troops and hundreds
of helicopters in Afghanistan so could easily fly in supplies and show they were helping us in our
hour of need , though some crews covered the American markings on their helicopters , fearing attack . 
For many in the remote areas it was the first time they had seen a foreigner . 
Most of the volunteers came from Islamic charities or organisations but some of these were fronts
for militant groups . The most visible of all was Jamaat-ul-Dawa ( JuD )  , the welfare wing of LashkareTaiba . LeT had close links to the ISI and was set up to liberate Kashmir , which we believe should be
part of Pakistan not India as its population is mostly Muslim . The leader of LeT is a fiery professor
from Lahore called Hafiz Saeed , who is often on television calling on people to attack India . When
the earthquake happened and our government did little to help , JuD set up relief camps patrolled by
men with Kalashnikovs and walkie-talkies . Everyone knew these men belonged to LeT , and soon their
black and white banners with crossed swords were flying everywhere in the mountains and valleys . 
In the town of Muzaffarabad in Azad Kashmir the JuD even set up a large field hospital with X-ray
machines , an operating theatre , a well-stocked pharmacy and a dental department . Doctors and
surgeons offered their services along with thousands of young volunteers . 
Earthquake victims praised the activists who had trudged up and down mountains and through
shattered valleys carrying medical help to remote regions no one else had bothered with . They helped
clear and rebuild destroyed villages as well as leading prayers and burying bodies . Even today , when
most of the foreign aid agencies have gone , shattered buildings still line the roadside and people are
still waiting for compensation from the government to build new houses , the JuD banners and helpers
are still present . My cousin who was studying in the UK said they raised lots of money from
Pakistanis living there . People later said that some of this money had been diverted to finance a plot
to bomb planes travelling from Britain to the US . 
With such a large number of people killed , there were many children orphaned – 11 , 000 of them . In
our culture orphans are usually taken in by the extended family , but the earthquake was so bad that
entire families had been wiped out or lost everything so were in no position to take in children . The
government promised they would all be looked after by the state , but that felt as empty as most
government promises . My father heard that many of the boys were taken in by the JuD and housed in
their madrasas . In Pakistan , madrasas are a kind of welfare system as they give free food and lodging , 
but their teaching does not follow a normal curriculum . The boys learn the Quran by heart , rocking
back and forth as they recite . They learn that there is no such thing as science or literature , that
dinosaurs never existed and that man never went to the moon . 
The whole nation was in shock for a long time after the earthquake . Already so unlucky with our
politicians and military dictators , now , on top of everything else , we had to deal with a natural
disaster . Mullahs from the TNSM preached that the earthquake was a warning from God . If we did
not mend our ways and introduce shariat or Islamic law , they shouted in their thundering voices , 
more severe punishment would come .

Radio Mullah
I WAS TEN when the Taliban came to our valley . Moniba and I had been reading the Twilight books
and longed to be vampires . It seemed to us that the Taliban arrived in the night just like vampires . 
They appeared in groups , armed with knives and Kalashnikovs , and first emerged in Upper Swat , in
the hilly areas of Matta . They didn ’ t call themselves Taliban to start with and didn ’ t look like the
Afghan Taliban we ’ d seen in pictures with their turbans and black-rimmed eyes . 
These were strange-looking men with long straggly hair and beards and camouflage vests over their
shalwar kamiz , which they wore with the trousers well above the ankle . They had jogging shoes or
cheap plastic sandals on their feet , and sometimes stockings over their heads with holes for their eyes , 
and they blew their noses dirtily into the ends of their turbans . They wore black badges which said
SHARIAT YA SHAHADAT – SHARIA LAW OR MARTYRDOM – and sometimes black turbans , so people
called them Tor Patki or the Black-Turbaned Brigade . They looked so dark and dirty that my father ’ s
friend described them as ‘ people deprived of baths and barbers ’  . 
Their leader was Maulana Fazlullah , a 28-year-old who used to operate the pulley chair to cross
the Swat River and whose right leg dragged because of childhood polio . He had studied in the
madrasa of Maulana Sufi Mohammad , the founder of the TNSM , and married his daughter . When Sufi
Mohammad was imprisoned in a round-up of militant leaders in 2002 , Fazlullah had taken over the
movement ’ s leadership . It was shortly before the earthquake that Fazlullah had appeared in Imam
Deri , a small village just a few miles outside Mingora on the other side of the Swat River , and set up
his illegal radio station . 
In our valley we received most of our information from the radio because so many had no TV or
are illiterate . Soon everyone seemed to be talking about the radio station . It became known as Mullah
FM and Fazlullah as the Radio Mullah . It broadcast every night from eight to ten and again in the
morning from seven to nine . 
In the beginning Fazlullah was very wise . He introduced himself as an Islamic reformer and an
interpreter of the Quran . My mother is very devout , and to start with she liked Fazlullah . He used his
station to encourage people to adopt good habits and abandon practices he said were bad . He said
men should keep their beards but give up smoking and using the tobacco they liked to chew . He said
people should stop using heroin , and chars , which is our word for hashish . He told people the correct
way to do their ablutions for prayers – which body part to wash first . He even told people how they
should wash their private parts . 
Sometimes his voice was reasonable , like when adults are trying to persuade you to do something
you don ’ t want to , and sometimes it was scary and full of fire . Often he would weep as he spoke of
his love for Islam . Usually he spoke for a while , then his deputy Shah Douran came on air , a man who
used to sell snacks from a tricycle in the bazaar . They warned people to stop listening to music , 
watching movies and dancing . Sinful acts like these had caused the earthquake , Fazlullah thundered , 
and if people didn ’ t stop they would again invite the wrath of God . Mullahs often misinterpret the
Quran and Hadith when they teach them in our country as few people understand the original Arabic . 
Fazlullah exploited this ignorance . 
 ‘ Is he right , Aba ?  ’ I asked my father . I remembered how frightening the earthquake had been . 
 ‘ No , Jani ,  ’ he replied .  ‘ He is just fooling people .  ’ 
My father said the radio station was the talk of the staffroom . By then our schools had about seventy
teachers , around forty men and thirty women . Some of the teachers were anti-Fazlullah but many
supported him . People thought that he was a good interpreter of the Holy Quran and admired his
charisma . They liked his talk of bringing back Islamic law as everyone was frustrated with the
Pakistani justice system , which had replaced ours when we were merged into the country . Cases such
as land disputes , common in our area , which used to be resolved quickly now took ten years to come
to court . Everyone wanted to see the back of the corrupt government officials sent into the valley . It
was almost as if they thought Fazlullah would recreate our old princely state from the time of the
wali . 
Within six months people were getting rid of their TVs , DVDs and CDs . Fazlullah ’ s men collected
them into huge heaps on the streets and set them on fire , creating clouds of thick black smoke that
reached high into the sky . Hundreds of CD and DVD shops closed voluntarily and their owners were
paid compensation by the Taliban . My brothers and I were worried as we loved our TV , but my father
reassured us that we were not getting rid of it . To be safe we moved it into a cupboard and watched it
with the volume low . The Taliban were known to listen at people ’ s doors then force their way in , 
take the TVs and smash them to pieces on the street . Fazlullah hated the Bollywood movies we so
loved , which he denounced as un-Islamic . Only the radio was allowed , and all music except for
Taliban songs was declared haram . 
One day my father went to visit a friend in hospital and found lots of patients listening to cassettes
of Fazlullah ’ s sermons .  ‘ You must meet Maulana Fazlullah ,  ’ people told him .  ‘ He ’ s a great scholar ’  . 
 ‘ He ’ s actually a high-school dropout whose real name isn ’ t even Fazlullah ,  ’ my father retorted , but
they wouldn ’ t listen . My father became depressed because people had begun to embrace Fazlullah ’ s
words and his religious romanticism .  ‘ It ’ s ridiculous ,  ’ my father would say ,  ‘ that this so-called
scholar is spreading ignorance .  ’ 
Fazlullah was particularly popular in remote areas where people remembered how TNSM
volunteers had helped during the earthquake when the government was nowhere to be seen . On some
mosques they set up speakers connected to radios so his broadcasts could be heard by everyone in the
village and in the fields . The most popular part of his show came every evening when he would read
out people ’ s names . He ’ d say ,  ‘ Mr So-and-so was smoking chars but has stopped because it ’ s sinful ,  ’ 
or ,  ‘ Mr X has kept his beard and I congratulate him ,  ’ or ,  ‘ Mr Y voluntarily closed down his CD
shop .  ’ He told them they would have their reward in the hereafter . People liked to hear their names on
the radio ; they also liked to hear which of their neighbours were sinful so they could gossip :  ‘ Have
you heard about So-and-so ?  ’ 
Mullah FM made jokes about the army . Fazlullah denounced Pakistani government officials as
 ‘ infidels ’ and said they were opposed to bringing in sharia law . He said that if they did not implement
it , his men would ‘ enforce it and tear them to pieces ’  . One of his favourite subjects was the injustice
of the feudal system of the khans . Poor people were happy to see the khans getting their comeuppance . 
They saw Fazlullah as a kind of Robin Hood and believed that when Fazlullah took over he would
give the khans ’ land to the poor . Some of the khans fled . My father was against ‘ khanism ’ but he said
the Taliban were worse . 
My father ’ s friend Hidayatullah had become a government official in Peshawar and warned us , 
 ‘ This is how these militants work . They want to win the hearts and minds of the people so they first
see what the local problems are and target those responsible , and that way they get the support of the
silent majority . That ’ s what they did in Waziristan when they went after kidnappers and bandits . 
After , when they get power , they behave like the criminals they once hunted down .  ’ 
Fazlullah ’ s broadcasts were often aimed at women . He must have known that many of our men
were away from home , working in coal mines in the south or on building sites in the Gulf . Sometimes
he would say ,  ‘ Men , go outside now . I am talking to the women .  ’ Then he ’ d say ,  ‘ Women are meant to
fulfil their responsibilities in the home . Only in emergencies can they go outside , but then they must
wear the veil .  ’ Sometimes his men would display the fancy clothes that they said they had taken from
 ‘ decadent women ’ to shame them . 
My friends at school said their mothers listened to the Radio Mullah although our headmistress
Madam Maryam told us not to . At home we only had my grandfather ’ s old radio , which was broken , 
but my mother ’ s friends all listened and told her what they heard . They praised Fazlullah and talked
of his long hair , the way he rode a horse and behaved like the Prophet . Women would tell him their
dreams and he would pray for them . My mother enjoyed these stories , but my father was horrified . 
I was confused by Fazlullah ’ s words . In the Holy Quran it is not written that men should go outside
and women should work all day in the home . In our Islamic studies class at school we used to write
essays entitled ‘ How the Prophet Lived ’  . We learned that the first wife of the Prophet was a
businesswoman called Khadijah . She was forty , fifteen years older than him , and she had been
married before , yet he still married her . I also knew from watching my own mother that Pashtun
women are very powerful and strong . Her mother , my grandmother , had looked after all eight children
alone after my grandfather had an accident and broke his pelvis and could not leave his bed for eight
years . 
A man goes out to work , he earns a wage , he comes back home , he eats , he sleeps . That ’ s what he
does . Our men think earning money and ordering around others is where power lies . They don ’ t think
power is in the hands of the woman who takes care of everyone all day long , and gives birth to their
children . In our house my mother managed everything because my father was so busy . It was my
mother who would wake up early in the morning , iron our school clothes , make our breakfast and
teach us how to behave . It was my mother who would go to the market , shop for us and cook . All
those things she did . 
In the first year of the Taliban I had two operations , one to take out my appendix and the other to
remove my tonsils . Khushal had his appendix out too . It was my mother who took us to hospital ; my
father just visited us and brought ice cream . Yet my mother still believed it was written in the Quran
that women should not go out and women should not talk to men other than relatives they cannot
marry . My father would say to her ,  ‘ Pekai , purdah is not only in the veil , purdah is in the heart .  ’ 
Lots of women were so moved by what Fazlullah said that they gave him gold and money , 
particularly in poor villages or households where the husbands were working abroad . Tables were
set up for the women to hand over their wedding bangles and necklaces and women queued up to do
so or sent their sons . Some gave their life savings , believing that this would make God happy . He
began building a vast red-brick headquarters in Imam Deri complete with a madrasa , a mosque and
walls and levees to protect it from the Swat River . No one knew where he got the cement and iron
bars from but the workforce was local . Every village had to take turns sending their men for a day to
help build it . One day one of our Urdu teachers , Nawab Ali , told my father ,  ‘ I won ’ t be coming to
school tomorrow .  ’ When my father asked why , he explained it was his village ’ s turn to work on
Fazlullah ’ s buildings . 
 ‘ Your prime responsibility is to teach the students ,  ’ replied my father . 
 ‘ No , I have to do this ,  ’ said Nawab Ali . 
My father came home fuming .  ‘ If people volunteered in the same way to construct schools or roads
or even clear the river of plastic wrappers , by God , Pakistan would become a paradise within a
year ,  ’ he said .  ‘ The only charity they know is to give to mosque and madrasa .  ’ 
A few weeks later the same teacher told him that he could no longer teach girls as ‘ the maulana
doesn ’ t like it ’  . 
My father tried to change his mind .  ‘ I agree that female teachers should educate girls ,  ’ he said .  ‘ But
first we need to educate our girls so they can become teachers !  ’ 
One day Sufi Mohammad proclaimed from jail that there should be no education for women even at
girls ’ madrasas .  ‘ If someone can show any example in history where Islam allows a female madrasa , 
they can come and piss on my beard ,  ’ he said . Then the Radio Mullah turned his attention to schools . 
He began speaking against school administrators and congratulating girls by name who left school . 
 ‘ Miss So-and-so has stopped going to school and will go to heaven ,  ’ he ’ d say , or ,  ‘ Miss X of Y
village has stopped education at Class 5 . I congratulate her .  ’ Girls like me who still went to school he
called buffaloes and sheep . 
My friends and I couldn ’ t understand why it was so wrong .  ‘ Why don ’ t they want girls to go to
school ?  ’ I asked my father . 
 ‘ They are scared of the pen ,  ’ he replied . 
Then another teacher at our school , a maths teacher with long hair , also refused to teach girls . My
father fired him , but some other teachers were worried and sent a delegation to his office .  ‘ Sir , don ’ t
do this ,  ’ they pleaded .  ‘ These are bad days . Let him stay and we will cover for him .  ’ 
Every day it seemed a new edict came . Fazlullah closed beauty parlours and banned shaving so
there was no work for barbers . My father , who only has a moustache , insisted he would not grow a
beard for the Taliban . The Taliban told women not to go to the bazaar . I didn ’ t mind not going to the
Cheena Bazaar . I didn ’ t enjoy shopping , unlike my mother , who liked beautiful clothes even though
we didn ’ t have much money . My mother always told me ,  ‘ Hide your face – people are looking at
you .  ’ 
I would reply ,  ‘ It doesn ’ t matter ; I ’ m also looking at them ,  ’ and she ’ d get so cross . 
My mother and her friends were upset about not being able to go shopping , particularly in the days
before the Eid holidays , when we beautify ourselves and go to the stalls lit up by fairy lights that sell
bangles and henna . All of that stopped . The women would not be attacked if they went to the markets , 
but the Taliban would shout at them and threaten them until they stayed at home . One Talib could
intimidate a whole village . We children were cross too . Normally there are new film releases for the
holidays , but Fazlullah had closed the DVD shops . Around this time my mother also got tired of
Fazlullah , especially when he began to preach against education and insist that those who went to
school would also go to hell . 
Next Fazlullah began holding a shura , a kind of local court . People liked this as justice was
speedy , unlike in Pakistani courts , where you could wait years and have to pay bribes to be heard . 
People began going to Fazlullah and his men to resolve grievances about anything from business
matters to personal feuds .  ‘ I had a thirty-year-old problem and it ’ s been resolved in one go ,  ’ one man
told my father . The punishments decreed by Fazlullah ’ s shura included public whippings , which we
had never seen before . One of my father ’ s friends told him he had seen three men publicly flogged
after the shura had found them guilty of involvement in the abduction of two women . A stage was set
up near Fazlullah ’ s centre , and after going to hear him give Friday prayers , hundreds of people
gathered to watch the floggings , shouting ‘ Allahu akbar !  ’ – ‘ God is great !  ’ with each lash . 
Sometimes Fazlullah appeared galloping in on a black horse . 
His men stopped health workers giving polio drops , saying the vaccinations were an American plot
to make Muslim women infertile so that the people of Swat would die out .  ‘ To cure a disease before
its onset is not in accordance with sharia law ,  ’ said Fazlullah on the radio .  ‘ You will not find a single
child to drink a drop of the vaccine anywhere in Swat .  ’ 
Fazlullah ’ s men patrolled the streets looking for offenders against his decrees just like the Taliban
morality police we had heard about in Afghanistan . They set up volunteer traffic police called Falcon
Commandos , who drove through the streets with machine guns mounted on top of their pick-up trucks . 
Some people were happy . One day my father ran into his bank manager .  ‘ One good thing Fazlullah
is doing is banning ladies and girls from going to the Cheena Bazaar , which saves us men money ,  ’ he
said . Few spoke out . My father complained that most people were like our local barber , who one day
grumbled to my father that he had only eighty rupees in his till , less than a tenth of what his takings
used to be . Just the day before the barber had told a journalist that the Taliban were good Muslims . 
After Mullah FM had been on air for about a year , Fazlullah became more aggressive . His brother
Maulana Liaquat , along with three of Liaquat ’ s sons , were among those killed in an American drone
attack on the madrasa in Bajaur at the end of October 2006 . Eighty people were killed including boys
as young as twelve , some of whom had come from Swat . We were all horrified by the attack and
people swore revenge . Ten days later a suicide bomber blew himself up in the army barracks at
Dargai , on the way from Islamabad to Swat , and killed forty-two Pakistani soldiers . At that time
suicide bombings were rare in Pakistan – there were six in total that year – and it was the biggest
attack that had ever been carried out by Pakistani militants . 
At Eid we usually sacrifice animals like goats or sheep . But Fazlullah said ,  ‘ On this Eid twolegged animals will be sacrificed .  ’ We soon saw what he meant . His men began killing khans and
political activists from secular and nationalist parties , especially the Awami National Party ( ANP )  . 
In January 2007 a close friend of one of my father ’ s friends was kidnapped in his village by eighty
masked gunmen . His name was Malak Bakht Baidar . He was from a wealthy khan family and the local
vice president of the ANP . His body was found dumped in his family ’ s ancestral graveyard . His legs
and arms had all been broken . It was the first targeted killing in Swat , and people said it was because
he had helped the army find Taliban hideouts . 
The authorities turned a blind eye . Our provincial government was still made up of mullah parties
who wouldn ’ t criticise anyone who claimed to be fighting for Islam . At first we thought we were safe
in Mingora , the biggest town in Swat . But Fazlullah ’ s headquarters were just a few miles away , and
even though the Taliban were not near our house they were in the markets , in the streets and the hills . 
Danger began to creep closer . 
During Eid we went to our family village as usual . I was in my cousin ’ s car , and as we drove
through a river where the road had been washed away we had to stop at a Taliban checkpoint . I was
in the back with my mother . My cousin quickly gave us his music cassettes to hide in our purses . The
Taliban were dressed in black and carried Kalashnikovs . They told us ,  ‘ Sisters , you are bringing
shame . You must wear burqas .  ’ 
When we arrived back at school after Eid , we saw a letter taped to the gate .  ‘ Sir , the school you
are running is Western and infidel ,  ’ it said .  ‘ You teach girls and have a uniform that is un-Islamic . 
Stop this or you will be in trouble and your children will weep and cry for you .  ’ It was signed , 
 ‘ Fedayeen of Islam ’  . 
My father decided to change the boys ’ uniform from shirt and trousers to shalwar kamiz , baggy
pyjama-like trousers and a long shirt . Ours remained a royal-blue shalwar kamiz with a white
dupatta , or headscarf , and we were advised to keep our heads covered coming in and out of school . 
His friend Hidayatullah told him to stand firm .  ‘ Ziauddin , you have charisma ; you can speak up and
organise against them ,  ’ he said .  ‘ Life isn ’ t just about taking in oxygen and giving out carbon dioxide . 
You can stay there accepting everything from the Taliban or you can make a stand against them .  ’ 
My father told us what Hidayatullah had said . He then wrote a letter to the Daily Azadi , our local
newspaper .  ‘ To the Fedayeen of Islam [ or Islamic sacrificers ]  , this is not the right way to implement
Islam ,  ’ he wrote .  ‘ Please don ’ t harm my children because the God you believe in is the same God
they pray to every day . You can take my life but please don ’ t kill my schoolchildren .  ’ When my father
saw the newspaper he was very unhappy . The letter had been buried on an inside page and the editor
had published his name and the address of the school , which my father had not expected him to do . 
But lots of people called to congratulate him .  ‘ You have put the first stone in standing water ,  ’ they
said .  ‘ Now we will have the courage to speak .  ’

Toffees , Tennis Balls and the Buddhas of Swat
FIRST THE TALIBAN took our music , then our Buddhas , then our history . One of our favourite things
was going on school trips . We were lucky to live in a paradise like Swat with so many beautiful
places to visit – waterfalls , lakes , the ski resort , the wali ’ s palace , the Buddha statues , the tomb of
Akhund of Swat . All these places told our special story . We would talk about the trips for weeks
beforehand , then , when the day finally came , we dressed up in our best clothes and piled into buses
along with pots of chicken and rice for a picnic . Some of us had cameras and took photographs . At the
end of the day my father would make us all take turns standing on a rock and tell stories about what
we had seen . When Fazlullah came there were no more school trips . Girls were not supposed to be
seen outside . 
The Taliban destroyed the Buddhist statues and stupas where we played , which had been there for
thousands of years and were a part of our history from the time of the Kushan kings . They believed
any statue or painting was haram , sinful and therefore prohibited . One black day they even dynamited
the face of the Jehanabad Buddha , which was carved into a hillside just half an hour ’ s drive from
Mingora and towered twenty-three feet into the sky . Archaeologists say it was almost as important as
the Buddhas of Bamiyan , which the Afghan Taliban blew up . 
It took them two goes to destroy it . The first time they drilled holes in the rock and filled them with
dynamite , but that didn ’ t work . A few weeks later , on 8 October 2007 , they tried again . This time they
obliterated the Buddha ’ s face , which had watched over the valley since the seventh century . The
Taliban became the enemy of fine arts , culture and our history . The Swat museum moved its
collection away for safekeeing . They destroyed everything old and brought nothing new . The Taliban
took over the Emerald Mountain with its mine and began selling the beautiful stones to buy their ugly
weapons . They took money from the people who chopped down our precious trees for timber and then
demanded more money to let their trucks pass . 
Their radio coverage spread across the valley and neighbouring districts . Though we still had our
television they had switched off the cable channels . Moniba and I could no longer watch our favourite
Bollywood shows like Shararat or Making Mischief . It seemed like the Taliban didn ’ t want us to do
anything . They even banned one of our favourite board games called Carrom in which we flick
counters across a wooden board . We heard stories that the Taliban would hear children laughing and
burst into the room and smash the boards . We felt like the Taliban saw us as little dolls to control , 
telling us what to do and how to dress . I thought if God wanted us to be like that He wouldn ’ t have
made us all different . 
One day we found our teacher Miss Hammeda in floods of tears . Her husband was a policeman in
the small town of Matta , and Fazlullah ’ s men had stormed in and some police officers had been
killed , including her husband . It was the first Taliban attack on the police in our valley . Soon they had
taken over many villages . The black and white flags of Fazlullah ’ s TNSM started appearing on police
stations . The militants would enter villages with megaphones and the police would flee . In a short
time they had taken over fifty-nine villages and set up their own parallel administrations . Policemen
were so scared of being killed that they took out adverts in the newspapers to announce they had left
the force . 
All this happened and nobody did a thing . It was as though everyone was in a trance . My father said
people had been seduced by Fazlullah . Some joined his men , thinking they would have better lives . 
My father tried to counter their propaganda but it was hard .  ‘ I have no militants and no FM radio ,  ’ he
joked . He even dared to enter the Radio Mullah ’ s own village one day to speak at a school . He
crossed the river in one of the metal boxes suspended from a pulley that we use as makeshift bridges . 
On the way he saw smoke so high it touched the clouds , the blackest smoke he ’ d ever seen . At first he
thought it might be a brick factory , but as he approached he saw bearded figures in turbans burning
TVs and computers . 
In the school my father told the people ,  ‘ I saw your villagers burning these things . Don ’ t you realise
the only ones who will profit are the companies in Japan , who will just make more ?  ’ 
Someone came up to him and whispered ,  ‘ Don ’ t speak any more in this way – it ’ s risky .  ’ 
Meanwhile the authorities , like most people , did nothing . 
It felt as though the whole country was going mad . The rest of Pakistan was preoccupied with
something else – the Taliban had moved right into the heart of our nation ’ s capital , Islamabad . We
saw pictures on the news of what people were calling the Burqa Brigade – young women and girls
like us in burqas with sticks , attacking CD and DVD shops in bazaars in the centre of Islamabad . 
The women were from Jamia Hafsa , the biggest female madrasa in our country and part of Lal
Masjid – the Red Mosque in Islamabad . It was built in 1965 and got its name from its red walls . It ’ s
just a few blocks from parliament and the headquarters of ISI , and many government officials and
military used to pray there . The mosque has two madrasas , one for girls and one for boys , which had
been used for years to recruit and train volunteers to fight in Afghanistan and Kashmir . It was run by
two brothers , Abdul Aziz and Abdul Rashid , and had become a centre for spreading propaganda
about bin Laden whom Abdul Rashid had met in Kandahar when visiting Mullah Omar . The brothers
were famed for their fiery sermons and attracted thousands of worshippers , particularly after 9 / 11 . 
When President Musharraf agreed to help America in the ‘ War on Terror ’  , the mosque broke off its
long links with the military and became a centre of protest against the government . Abdul Rashid was
even accused of being part of a plot to blow up Musharraf ’ s convoy in Rawalpindi in December
2003 . Investigators said the explosives used had been stored in Lal Masjid . But a few months later he
was cleared . 
When Musharraf sent troops into the FATA , starting with Waziristan in 2004 , the brothers led a
campaign declaring the military action un-Islamic . They had their own website and pirate FM station
on which they broadcast , just like Fazlullah . 
Around the same time as our Taliban were emerging in Swat , the girls of the Red Mosque madrasa
began terrorising the streets of Islamabad . They raided houses they claimed were being used as
massage centres , they kidnapped women they said were prostitutes and closed down DVD shops , 
again making bonfires of CDs and DVDs . When it suits the Taliban , women can be vocal and visible . 
The head of the madrasa was Umme Hassan , the wife of the elder brother , Abdul Aziz , and she even
boasted that she had trained many of her girls to become suicide bombers . The mosque also set up its
own courts to dispense Islamic justice , saying the state had failed . Their militants kidnapped
policemen and ransacked government buildings . 
The Musharraf government didn ’ t seem to know what to do . This was perhaps because the military
had been so attached to the mosque . But by the middle of 2007 the situation was so bad that people
began to worry the militants could take over the capital . It was almost unbelievable – Islamabad is
usually a quiet , orderly place , very different to the rest of our country . Finally on the evening of 3 July
commandos with tanks and armoured personnel carriers surrounded the mosque . They cut off the
electricity in the area , and as dusk fell there was a sudden burst of gunfire and explosions . The troops
blasted holes in the wall surrounding the mosque and fired mortars at the compound as helicopter
gunships hovered overhead . Over loudspeakers they called for the girls to surrender . 
Many of the militants in the mosque had fought in Afghanistan or Kashmir . They barricaded
themselves and the madrasa students inside concrete bunkers with sandbags . Worried parents
gathered outside , calling their daughters on mobile phones , begging them to come out . Some of the
girls refused , saying their teachers had taught them that to become a martyr is a glorious thing . 
The next evening a small group of girls emerged . Hidden among them was Abdul Aziz , disguised in
a burqa , along with his daughter . But his wife and younger brother stayed inside , along with many
students , and there were daily exchanges of gunfire between the militants and the troops outside . The
militants had RPGs and petrol bombs made from Sprite bottles . The siege went on until late on 9 July , 
when the commander of the special forces outside was killed by a sniper in one of the minarets . The
military finally lost patience and stormed the compound . 
They called it Operation Silence although it was very loud . Never had there been such a battle in
the heart of our capital . Commandos fought from room to room for hours until they finally tracked
Abdul Rashid and his followers to a basement where they killed him . By nightfall on 10 July , when
the siege was finally over , around a hundred people had been killed including several soldiers and a
number of children . The news showed shocking pictures of the wreckage , everywhere blood and
broken glass , and dead bodies . We all watched in horror . Some of the students at the two madrasas
were from Swat . How could something like that happen in our capital city and in a mosque ? A
mosque is a sacred place for us . 
It was after the Red Mosque siege that the Swat Taliban changed . On 12 July – which I remember
because it was my birthday – Fazlullah gave a radio address that was quite different to his previous
ones . He raged against the Lal Masjid attack and vowed to avenge the death of Abdul Rashid . Then he
declared war on the Pakistani government . 
This was the start of real trouble . Fazlullah could now carry out his threats and mobilise support
for his Taliban in the name of Lal Masjid . A few days later they attacked an army convoy travelling in
the direction of Swat and killed thirteen soldiers . The backlash wasn ’ t just in Swat . There was an
enormous protest by tribesmen in Bajaur and a wave of suicide bombings across the country . There
was one ray of hope – Benazir Bhutto was returning . The Americans were worried that their ally
General Musharraf was too unpopular in Pakistan to be effective against the Taliban so they had
helped broker an unlikely power-sharing deal . The plan was that Musharraf would finally take off his
uniform and be a civilian president , supported by Benazir ’ s party . In return he would drop corruption
charges against her and her husband and agree to hold elections , which everyone assumed would
result in Benazir becoming prime minister . No Pakistani , including my father , thought this deal would
work as Musharraf and Benazir hated each other . 
Benazir had been in exile since I was two years old , but I had heard so much about her from my
father and was very excited that she would return and we might have a woman leader once more . It
was because of Benazir that girls like me could think of speaking out and becoming politicians . She
was our role model . She symbolised the end of dictatorship and the beginning of democracy as well
as sending a message of hope and strength to the rest of the world . She was also our only political
leader to speak out against the militants and even offered to help American troops hunt for bin Laden
inside Pakistani borders . 
Some people obviously did not like that . On 18 October 2007 we were all glued to the TV as she
walked down the steps of the plane in Karachi and wept as she stepped onto Pakistani soil after
almost nine years in exile . When she paraded on an open-top bus through the streets , hundreds of
thousands of people flocked to see her . They had travelled from all over the country and many of them
were carrying small children . Some released white doves , one of which flew to perch on Benazir ’ s
shoulder . The crowds were so large that the bus moved at a walking pace . We stopped watching after
a while as it was clearly going to take hours . 
I had gone to bed when just before midnight the militants struck . Benazir ’ s bus was blown up in a
wave of orange flame . My father told me the news when I woke up the next morning . He and his
friends were in such a state of shock that they had not gone to bed . Luckily , Benazir survived because
she had gone downstairs to an armoured compartment to rest her feet just before the explosions , but
150 people had been killed . It was the biggest bomb ever to have gone off in our country . Many of the
dead were students who had made a human chain around the bus . They called themselves Martyrs for
Benazir . At school that day everyone was subdued , even those who had opposed Benazir . We were
devastated but also thankful that she had survived . 
About a week later the army came to Swat , making lots of noise with their jeeps and helicopters . We
were at school when the helicopters first arrived and were very excited . We ran outside and they
threw toffees and tennis balls down to us , which we rushed to catch . Helicopters were a rare sight in
Swat , but since our house was close to the local army headquarters they sometimes flew right over us . 
We used to hold competitions for who would collect the most toffees . 
One day a man from along the street came and told us that it had been announced in the mosques
that there would be a curfew the next day . We didn ’ t know what a curfew was and were anxious . 
There was a hole in the wall to our neighbours ’ house , Safina ’ s family , through which we used to
communicate with them , and we knocked on the wall so they would come to the hole .  ‘ What does it
mean this curfew ?  ’ we asked . When they explained , we didn ’ t even come out of our rooms because
we thought something bad might happen . Later the curfew took over our lives . 
We heard on the news that Musharraf had sent 3 , 000 troops into our valley to confront the Taliban . 
They occupied all government and private buildings which they thought were of strategic importance . 
Until then it had seemed as if the rest of Pakistan was ignoring what was happening in Swat . The
following day a suicide bomber attacked another army truck in Swat , killing seventeen soldiers and
thirteen civilians . Then all that night we heard dar dar dar , the boom of cannons and machine guns
from the hills . It was hard to sleep . 
On the TV the next day we heard that fighting had erupted in the hills to the north . School was
closed and we stayed at home , trying to understand what was going on . The fighting was taking place
outside Mingora though we could still hear gunfire . The military said it had killed more than a
hundred militants , but then on the first day of November around 700 Taliban overran an army position
at Khwazakhela . Some fifty men deserted from the Frontier Corps and another forty-eight were
captured and then paraded around . Fazlullah ’ s men humiliated them by taking their uniforms and guns
and giving them each 500 rupees to make their way back . The Taliban then took two police stations in
Khwazakhela and moved on to Madyan , where more police officers gave up their weapons . Very
quickly the Taliban controlled most of Swat outside Mingora . 
On 12 November Musharraf ordered 10 , 000 more troops into our valley with additional helicopter
gunships . The army was everywhere . They even camped on the golf course , their big guns trained on
the hillsides . They then launched an operation against Fazlullah which later became known as the first
battle of Swat . It was the first time the army had launched an operation against its own people outside
the FATA . Police once tried to capture Fazlullah when he was speaking at a gathering , but a giant
sandstorm blew up and he managed to escape . This added to his mystery and spiritual reputation . 
The militants did not give up easily . Instead they advanced to the east and on 16 November
captured Alpuri , the main town of Shangla . Again local police fled without a fight . People there said
Chechens and Uzbeks were among the fighters . We worried about our family in Shangla , though my
father said the village was too remote for the Taliban to bother with and local people had made it
clear they would keep them out . The Pakistan army had far more men and heavy weapons so they
quickly managed to recapture the valley . They took Imam Deri , the headquarters of Fazlullah . The
militants fled to the forests and by early December the army said they had cleared most areas . 
Fazlullah retreated into the mountains . 
But they did not drive the Taliban away .  ‘ This will not last ,  ’ my father predicted . 
Fazlullah ’ s group was not the only one causing havoc . All across north-western Pakistan different
militant groups had emerged led by people from various tribal groups . About a week after the battle
of Swat , forty Taliban leaders from across our province met in South Waziristan to declare war on
Pakistan . They agreed to form a united front under the banner of Tehrik-i-Taliban-Pakistan ( TTP )  , or
the Pakistan Taliban , and claimed to have 40 , 000 fighters between them . They chose as their leader a
man in his late thirties called Baitullah Mehsud , who had fought in Afghanistan . Fazlullah was made
chief of the Swat sector . 
When the army arrived we thought that the fighting would soon stop , but we were wrong . There
was much more to come . The Taliban targeted not only politicians , MPs and the police , but also
people who were not observing purdah , wearing the wrong length of beard or the wrong kind of
shalwar kamiz . 
On 27 December Benazir Bhutto addressed an election rally in Liaquat Bagh , the park in
Rawalpindi where our first prime minister , Liaquat Ali , was assassinated .  ‘ We will defeat the forces
of extremism and militancy with the power of the people ,  ’ she declared to loud cheers . She was in a
special bulletproof Toyota Land Cruiser , and as it left the park she stood up on the seat and popped
her head through the sunroof to wave to supporters . Suddenly there was the crack of gunfire and an
explosion as a suicide bomber blew himself up by the side of her vehicle . Benazir slid back down . 
The Musharraf government later said she hit her head on the roof handle ; other people said she had
been shot . 
We were watching the TV when the news came through . My grandmother said ,  ‘ Benazir will
become shaheed ,  ’ meaning she would die an honourable death . We all started crying and praying for
her . When we learned she was dead , my heart said to me , Why don ’ t you go there and fight for
women ’ s rights ? We were looking forward to democracy and now people asked ,  ‘ If Benazir can die , 
nobody is safe .  ’ It felt as if my country was running out of hope . 
Musharraf blamed Benazir ’ s death on Baitullah Mehsud , the TTP leader , and released a transcript
of an intercepted phone call that was supposed to be between him and a fellow militant discussing the
attack . Baitullah denied responsibility , which was unusual for the Taliban . 
We used to have Islamic studies teachers – qari sahibs – who came to our home to teach the Quran to
me and other local children . By the time the Taliban came I had finished my recitation of the complete
Quran , what we call Khatam ul-Quran , much to the delight of Baba , my grandfather the cleric . We
recite in Arabic , and most people don ’ t actually know what the verses mean , but I had also started
learning them in translation . To my horror one qari sahib tried to justify Benazir ’ s assassination .  ‘ It
was a very good job she was killed ,  ’ he said .  ‘ When she was alive she was useless . She was not
following Islam properly . If she had lived there would have been anarchy .  ’ 
I was shocked and told my father .  ‘ We don ’ t have any option . We are dependent on these mullahs
to learn the Quran ,  ’ he said .  ‘ But you just use him to learn the literal meaning of the words ; don ’ t
follow his explanations and interpretation . Only learn what God says . His words are divine
messages , which you are free and independent to interpret .  ’

The Clever Class
IT WAS SCHOOL that kept me going in those dark days . When I was in the street it felt as though every
man I passed might be a talib . We hid our school bags and our books in our shawls . My father always
said that the most beautiful thing in a village in the morning is the sight of a child in a school uniform , 
but now we were afraid to wear them . 
We had moved up to high school . Madam Maryam said no one wanted to teach our class as we
asked so many questions . We liked to be known as the clever girls . When we decorated our hands
with henna for holidays and weddings , we drew calculus and chemical formulae instead of flowers
and butterflies . My rivalry with Malka-e-Noor continued , but after the shock of being beaten by her
when she first joined our school , I worked hard and had managed to regain my position on the school
honours board for first in class . She usually came second and Moniba third . The teachers told us
examiners first looked at how much we had written , then presentation . Moniba had the most beautiful
writing and presentation of the three of us , but I always told her she did not trust herself enough . She
worked hard as she worried that if she got low marks her male relatives might use it as an excuse to
stop her education . I was weakest in maths – once I got zero in a test – but I worked hard at it . My
chemistry teacher Sir Obaidullah ( we called all our teachers Sir or Miss ) said I was a born politician
because , at the start of oral exams , I would always say ,  ‘ Sir , can I just say you are the best teacher
and yours is my favourite class .  ’ 
Some parents complained that I was being favoured because my father owned the school , but
people were always surprised that despite our rivalry we were all good friends and not jealous of
each other . We also competed in what we call board exams . These would select the best students
from private schools in the district , and one year Malka-e-Noor and I got exactly the same marks . We
did another paper at school to see who would get the prize and again we got equal marks . So people
wouldn ’ t think I was getting special treatment , my father arranged for us to do papers at another
school , that of his friend Ahmad Shah . Again we got the same , so we both got the prize . 
There was more to school than work . We liked performing plays . I wrote a sketch based on Romeo
and Juliet about corruption . I played Romeo as a civil servant interviewing people for a job . The
first candidate is a beautiful girl , and he asks her very easy questions such as ,  ‘ How many wheels
does a bicycle have ?  ’ When she replies ,  ‘ Two ,  ’ he says ,  ‘ You are so brilliant .  ’ The next candidate is
a man so Romeo asks him impossible things like ,  ‘ Without leaving your chair tell me the make of the
fan in the room above us .  ’  ‘ How could I possibly know ?  ’ asks the candidate .  ‘ You ’ re telling me you
have a PhD and you don ’ t know !  ’ replies Romeo . He decides to give the job to the girl . 
The girl was played by Moniba , of course , and another classmate Attiya played the part of my
assistant to add some salt , pepper and masala with her witty asides . Everyone laughed a lot . I like to
mimic people , and in breaks my friends used to beg me to impersonate our teachers , particularly Sir
Obaidullah . With all the bad stuff going on in those days , we needed small , small reasons to laugh . 
The army action at the end of 2007 had not got rid of the Taliban . The army had stayed in Swat and
were everywhere in the town , yet Fazlullah still broadcast every day on the radio and throughout
2008 the situation was even worse than before with bomb blasts and killings . All we talked about in
those days was the army and the Taliban and the feeling that we were caught between the two . Attiya
used to tease me by saying ,  ‘ Taliban is good , army not good .  ’ I replied ,  ‘ If there is a snake and a lion
coming to attack us what would we say is good , the snake or lion ?  ’ 
Our school was a haven from the horrors outside . All the other girls in my class wanted to be
doctors , but I decided I wanted to be an inventor and make an anti-Taliban machine which would sniff
them out and destroy their guns . But of course at school we were under threat too , and some of my
friends dropped out . Fazlullah kept broadcasting that girls should stay at home and his men had started
blowing up schools , usually during night-time curfew when the children were not there . 
The first school to be blown up was Shawar Zangay , a government girls ’ primary school in Matta . 
We couldn ’ t believe anyone would do such a thing . Then many more bombings followed , almost
every day . Even in Mingora , there were explosions . Twice bombs went off when I was in the kitchen , 
so close by that the whole house rattled and the fan above the window fell down . I became very
scared of going into the kitchen and would only run in and out . 
On the last day of February 2008 I was in the kitchen when we heard an enormous blast . It was earshatteringly loud and obviously close by . As we always did , we called to each other to make sure we
were all safe .  ‘ Khaista , Pisho , Bhabi , Khushal , Atal !  ’ Then we heard sirens , one after another as if
all the ambulances of Mingora were passing . A suicide bomber had struck in the basketball court at
Haji Baba High School . Funeral prayers had been under way for a popular local police officer , Javid
Iqbal , who had been killed by a suicide bomber in a remote area while trying to escape from the
Taliban . He was from Mingora , and his body had been brought back for the funeral and a police
salute . Now the Taliban had bombed the mourners . More than fifty-five people were killed , including
Javid Iqbal ’ s young son and many people we knew . Ten members of Moniba ’ s family were there and
were either killed or injured . Moniba was devastated and the whole town was in shock . There were
condolences in every mosque . 
 ‘ Are you scared now ?  ’ I asked my father . 
 ‘ At night our fear is strong , Jani ,  ’ he told me ,  ‘ but in the morning , in the light , we find our courage
again .  ’ And this is true for my family . We were scared , but our fear was not as strong as our courage . 
 ‘ We must rid our valley of the Taliban , and then no one has to feel this fear ,  ’ he said . 
In times of crisis we Pashtuns resort to the old trusted ways , so in 2008 elders in Swat created an
assembly called the Qaumi Jirga to challenge Fazlullah . Three local men , Mukhtar Khan Yousafzai , 
Khurshid Kakajee and Zahid Khan went from hujra to hujra persuading elders to join together . The
senior elder was a white-bearded man of seventy-four called Abdul Khan Khaliq who had been one
of the Queen ’ s bodyguards when she had visited Swat to stay with our wali . Even though my father
was not an elder or a khan , he was chosen as spokesperson as he was not afraid to speak out . Though
he was more poetic in Pashto , he could speak our national language , Urdu , and English fluently , which
meant he was an effective communicator outside Swat as well as inside . 
Every day , on behalf of the Swat Council of Elders , he was at seminars or on the media challenging
Fazlullah .  ‘ What are you doing ?  ’ he would ask .  ‘ You are playing havoc with our lives and our
culture .  ’ 
My father would say to me ,  ‘ Any organisation which works for peace , I will join . If you want to
resolve a dispute or come out from conflict , the very first thing is to speak the truth . If you have a
headache and tell the doctor you have a stomach ache , how can the doctor help ? You must speak the
truth . The truth will abolish fear .  ’ 
When he met his fellow activists , particularly his old friends Ahmad Shah , Mohammad Farooq and
Zahid Khan , I often went with him . Ahmad Shah also had a school , where Mohammad Farooq
worked , and they would sometimes gather on his lawn . Zahid Khan was a hotel owner and had a big
hujra . When they came to our house I would bring them tea then sit quietly listening as they discussed
what to do .  ‘ Malala is not just the daughter of Ziauddin ,  ’ they would say ;  ‘ she is the daughter of all of
us .  ’ 
They went back and forth to Peshawar and Islamabad and gave lots of interviews on the radio , 
particularly to the Voice of America and the BBC , taking turns so there would always be one of them
available . They told people that what was happening in Swat was not about Islam . My father said the
Taliban presence in Swat was not possible without the support of some in the army and the
bureaucracy . The state is meant to protect the rights of its citizens , but it ’ s a very difficult situation
when you can ’ t tell the difference between state and non-state and can ’ t trust the state to protect you
against non-state . 
Our military and ISI are very powerful and most people did not like to voice these things publicly , 
but my father and many of his friends were not scared .  ‘ What you are doing is against our people and
against Pakistan ,  ’ he would say .  ‘ Don ’ t support Talibanisation , it ’ s inhuman . We are told that Swat is
being sacrificed for the sake of Pakistan , but no one and nothing should be sacrificed for the state . A
state is like a mother , and a mother never deserts or cheats her children .  ’ 
He hated the fact that most people would not speak up . In his pocket he kept a poem written by
Martin Niemöller , who had lived in Nazi Germany . 
First they came for the communists , 
and I didn ’ t speak out because I wasn ’ t a communist . 
Then they came for the socialists , 
and I didn ’ t speak out because I wasn ’ t a socialist . 
Then they came for the trade unionists , 
and I didn ’ t speak out because I wasn ’ t a trade unionist . 
Then they came for the Jews , 
and I didn ’ t speak out because I was not a Jew . 
Then they came for the Catholics , 
and I didn ’ t speak out because I was not a Catholic . 
Then they came for me , 
and there was no one left to speak for me . 
I knew he was right . If people were silent nothing would change . 
At school my father organised a peace march and encouraged us to speak out against what was
happening . Moniba put it well .  ‘ We Pashtuns are a religion-loving people ,  ’ she said .  ‘ Because of the
Taliban , the whole world is claiming we are terrorists . This is not the case . We are peace-loving . 
Our mountains , our trees , our flowers – everything in our valley is about peace .  ’ A group of us girls
gave an interview on ATV Khyber , the only privately owned Pashto television channel , about girls
dropping out of school due to militancy . Teachers helped us beforehand on how to respond to
questions . I wasn ’ t the only one to be interviewed . When we were eleven and twelve , we did them
together , but as we turned thirteen or fourteen my friends ’ brothers and fathers didn ’ t allow them
because they had entered puberty and should observe purdah and also they were afraid . 
One day I went on Geo , which is one of the biggest news channels in our country . There was a wall
of screens in their office . I was astonished to see so many channels . Afterwards I thought , The media
needs interviews . They want to interview a small girl , but the girls are scared , and even if they ’ re
not , their parents won ’ t allow it . I have a father who isn ’ t scared , who stands by me . He said ,  ‘ You
are a child and it ’ s your right to speak .  ’ The more interviews I gave , the stronger I felt and the more
support we received . I was only eleven but I looked older , and the media seemed to like hearing from
a young girl . One journalist called me takra jenai – a ‘ bright shining young lady ’ and another said you
are ‘ pakha jenai ’ – you are wise beyond your years . In my heart was the belief that God would protect
me . If I am speaking for my rights , for the rights of girls , I am not doing anything wrong . It ’ s my duty to
do so . God wants to see how we behave in such situations . There is a saying in the Quran ,  ‘ The
falsehood has to go and the truth will prevail .  ’ If one man , Fazlullah , can destroy everything , why
can ’ t one girl change it ? I wondered . I prayed to God every night to give me strength . 
The media in Swat were under pressure to give positive coverage to the Taliban – some even
respectfully called the Taliban spokesman Muslim Khan ‘ School dada ’  , when in reality he was
destroying schools . But many local journalists were unhappy about what was happening to their
valley and they gave us a powerful platform as we would say things they didn ’ t dare to . 
We didn ’ t have a car so we went by rickshaw , or one of my father ’ s friends would take us to the
interviews . One day my father and I went to Peshawar to appear on a BBC Urdu talk show hosted by
a famous columnist called Wasatullah Khan . We went with my father ’ s friend Fazal Maula and his
daughter . Two fathers and two daughters . To represent the Taliban they had Muslim Khan , who
wasn ’ t in the studio . I was a bit nervous but I knew it was important as many people all over Pakistan
would be listening .  ‘ How dare the Taliban take away my basic right to education ?  ’ I said . There was
no response from Muslim Khan because his phone interview had been pre-recorded . How can a
recording respond to live questions ? 
Afterwards people congratulated me . My father laughed and said I should go into politics .  ‘ Even as
a toddler you talked like a politician ,  ’ he teased . But I never listened to my interviews . I knew these
were very small steps . 
Our words were like the eucalyptus blossoms of spring tossed away on the wind . The destruction
of schools continued . On the night of 7 October 2008 we heard a series of faraway blasts . The next
morning we learned that masked militants had entered the Sangota Convent School for girls and the
Excelsior College for boys and blown them up using improvised explosive devices ( IEDs )  . The
teachers had already been evacuated as they had received threats earlier . These were famous schools , 
particularly Sangota , which dated from the time of the last wali and was well known for academic
excellence . They were also big – Excelsior had over 2 , 000 pupils and Sangota had 1 , 000 . My father
went there after the bombings and found the buildings completely razed to the ground . He gave
interviews to TV reporters amid broken bricks and burned books and returned home horrified .  ‘ It ’ s
all just rubble ,  ’ he said . 
Yet my father remained hopeful and believed there would be a day when there was an end to the
destruction . What really depressed him was the looting of the destroyed schools – the furniture , the
books , the computers were all stolen by local people . He cried when he heard this ,  ‘ They are vultures
jumping on a dead body .  ’ 
The next day he went on a live show on the Voice of America and angrily condemned the attacks . 
Muslim Khan , the Taliban spokesman , was on the phone .  ‘ What was so wrong with these two schools
that you should bomb them ?  ’ my father asked him . 
Muslim Khan said that Sangota was a convent school teaching Christianity and that Excelsior was
co-educational , teaching girls and boys together .  ‘ Both things are false !  ’ replied my father .  ‘ Sangota
school has been there since the 1960s and never converted anyone to Christianity – in fact some of
them converted to Islam . And Excelsior is only co-educational in the primary section .  ’ 
Muslim Khan didn ’ t answer .  ‘ What about their own daughters ?  ’ I asked my father .  ‘ Don ’ t they want
them to learn ?  ’ 
Our headmistress Madam Maryam had studied at Sangota , and her younger sister Ayesha was a
pupil there , so she and some of the other Sangota girls transferred to our school . The monthly school
fees were never enough to cover all our outgoings so the extra fees were welcome , but my father was
unhappy . He went everywhere he could demanding the reconstruction of both schools . Once he spoke
at a big gathering and held up an audience member ’ s baby girl and said ,  ‘ This girl is our future . Do
we want her to be ignorant ?  ’ The crowd agreed that they would sacrifice themselves before giving up
their daughters ’ education . The new girls had horrible stories . Ayesha told us how one day on the way
home from Sangota she had seen a Taliban holding up the severed head of a policeman by its hair , 
blood dripping from the neck . The Sangota girls were also very bright , which meant more
competition . One of them , Rida , was excellent at making speeches . She became a good friend of mine
and of Moniba ’ s , which sometimes caused fights as three is a tricky number . Moniba often brought
food to school and would just bring one spare fork .  ‘ Are you my friend or Rida ’ s ?  ’ I asked Moniba . 
She laughed and said ,  ‘ We are all three good friends .  ’ 
By the end of 2008 , around 400 schools had been destroyed by the Taliban . We had a new
government under President Asif Zardari , the widower of Benazir , but they didn ’ t seem to care about
Swat . I told people things would be different if Zardari ’ s own daughters were at school in Swat . 
There were suicide bombings all over the country : even the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad had been
blown up . 
In Swat it was safer in the town than in the remote areas and many of our family came from the
countryside to stay with us . The house was small and got very crowded with the cousins who already
lived with us . There was little to do . We couldn ’ t play cricket in the street or on the roof like we used
to . We played marbles in the yard over and over again . I fought non-stop with my brother Khushal , 
and he would go crying to our mother . Never in history have Khushal and Malala been friends . 
I liked doing my hair in different styles and would spend ages in the bathroom in front of the mirror
trying out looks I had seen in movies . Until I was eight or nine my mother used to cut my hair short
like my brothers because of lice and also to make it easier to wash and brush as it would get messed
up under my shawl . But finally I had persuaded her to let me grow it to my shoulders . Unlike Moniba , 
who has straight hair , mine is wavy , and I liked to twist it into curls or tie it into plaits .  ‘ What are you
doing in there Pisho ?  ’ my mother would shout .  ‘ Our guests need the bathroom and everyone is having
to wait for you .  ’ 
One of the worst times was the fasting month of Ramadan in 2008 . During Ramadan no food or
drink can pass a Muslim ’ s lips in daylight hours . The Taliban bombed the power station so we had no
electricity , then a few days later they blasted the pipeline so we had no gas either . The price of the
gas cylinders we used to buy from the market doubled so my mother had to cook on a fire like we did
in the village . She didn ’ t complain – food needed to be cooked and she cooked it , and there were
others worse off than us . But there was no clean water and people started dying from cholera . The
hospital could not cope with all the patients and had to erect big tents outside to treat people . 
Though we had no generator at home , my father bought one to install at the school , and fresh water
was pumped from a bore-hole , which all the children in the neighbourhood went to collect . Every day
there would be lines of people waiting to fill jugs , bottles and drums . One of the neighbours got
frightened .  ‘ What are you doing ?  ’ he asked .  ‘ If the Taliban find out you ’ re giving water in the month
of Ramadan they will bomb us !  ’ 
My father replied that people would die either of thirst or bombings . 
The days when we used to go for trips or for picnics seemed like a dream . No one would venture
from their homes after sunset . The terrorists even blew up the ski lift and the big hotel in Malam
Jabba where tourists used to stay . A holiday paradise turned into a hell where no tourist would
venture . 
Then , at the end of 2008 , Fazlullah ’ s deputy Maulana Shah Dauran announced on the radio that all
girls ’ schools would close . From 15 January girls must not go to school , he warned . First I thought it
was a joke .  ‘ How can they stop us from going to school ?  ’ I asked my friends .  ‘ They don ’ t have the
power . They are saying they will destroy the mountain but they can ’ t even control the road .  ’ 
The other girls didn ’ t agree with me .  ‘ Who will stop them ?  ’ they asked .  ‘ They have already blown
up hundreds of schools and no one has done anything .  ’ 
My father used to say the people of Swat and the teachers would continue to educate our children
until the last room , the last teacher and the last student was alive . My parents never once suggested I
should withdraw from school , ever . Though we loved school , we hadn ’ t realised how important
education was until the Taliban tried to stop us . Going to school , reading and doing our homework
wasn ’ t just a way of passing time , it was our future . 
That winter it snowed and we built snow bears but without much joy . In winter the Taliban used to
disappear into the mountains , but we knew they would be back and had no idea what was coming
next . We believed school would start again . The Taliban could take our pens and books , but they
couldn ’ t stop our minds from thinking .

The Bloody Square
THE BODIES WOULD be dumped in the square at night so that everyone would see them the next
morning on their way to work . There was usually a note pinned to them saying something like ,  ‘ This is
what happens to an army agent ’  , or ‘ Do not touch this body until 11 a . m . or you will be next .  ’ On
some of the nights of the killings there would also be earthquakes , which made people even more
scared as we connect every natural disaster with a human disaster . 
They killed Shabana on a bitterly cold night in January 2009 . She lived in Banr Bazaar , a narrow
street in our town of Mingora which is famous for its dancers and musicians . Shabana ’ s father said a
group of men had knocked at her door and asked her to dance for them . She went to put on her dancing
clothes , and when she returned to dance for them , they pulled out their guns and threatened to slit her
throat . This happened after the 9 p . m . curfew and people heard her screaming ,  ‘ I promise I ’ ll stop ! I
promise I won ’ t sing and dance again . Leave me , for God ’ s sake ! I am a woman , a Muslim . Don ’ t kill
me !  ’ Then shots rang out and her bullet-ridden body was dragged to Green Chowk . So many bodies
had been left there that people started calling it the Bloody Square . 
We heard about Shabana ’ s death the next morning . On Mullah FM , Fazlullah said she deserved to
die for her immoral character and any other girls found performing in Banr Bazaar would be killed
one by one . We used to be proud of our music and art in Swat , but now most of the dancers fled to
Lahore or to Dubai . Musicians took out adverts in the papers saying they had stopped playing and
were pledging to live pious lives to appease the Taliban . 
People used to talk about Shabana ’ s bad character , but our men both wished to see her dance and
also despised her because she was a dancer . A khan ’ s daughter can ’ t marry a barber ’ s son and a
barber ’ s daughter can ’ t marry a khan ’ s son . We Pashtuns love shoes but don ’ t love the cobbler ; we
love our scarves and blankets but do not respect the weaver . Manual workers made a great
contribution to our society but received no recognition , and this is the reason so many of them joined
the Taliban – to finally achieve status and power . 
So people loved to see Shabana dance but didn ’ t respect her , and when she was murdered they said
nothing . Some even agreed with her killing , out of fear of the Taliban or because they were in favour
of them .  ‘ Shabana was not a Muslim ,  ’ they said .  ‘ She was bad , and it was right that she was killed .  ’ 
I can ’ t say that was the worst day . Around the time of Shabana ’ s murder every day seemed like the
worst day ; every moment was the worst . The bad news was everywhere : this person ’ s place bombed , 
this school blown up , public whippings . The stories were endless and overwhelming . A couple of
weeks after Shabana ’ s murder , a teacher in Matta was killed when he refused to pull his shalwar
above the ankle the way the Taliban wore theirs . He told them that nowhere in Islam is this required . 
They hung him and then they shot his father . 
I couldn ’ t understand what the Taliban were trying to do .  ‘ They are abusing our religion ,  ’ I said in
interviews .  ‘ How will you accept Islam if I put a gun to your head and say Islam is the true religion ? 
If they want every person in the world to be Muslim why don ’ t they show themselves to be good
Muslims first ?  ’ 
Regularly my father would come home shaken up due to the terrible things he had witnessed and
heard about such as policemen beheaded , their heads paraded through the town . Even those who had
defended Fazlullah at the start , believing his men were the real standard-bearers of Islam , and given
him their gold , began to turn against him . My father told me about a woman who had donated
generously to the Taliban while her husband was working abroad . When he came back and found out
she had given away her gold he was furious . One night there was a small explosion in their village
and the wife cried .  ‘ Don ’ t cry ,  ’ said her husband .  ‘ That is the sound of your earrings and nose studs . 
Now listen to the sound of your lockets and bangles .  ’ 
Yet still so few people spoke out . My father ’ s old rival in college politics Ihsan ul-Haq Haqqani
had become a journalist in Islamabad and organised a conference on the situation in Swat . None of the
lawyers and academics he invited from Swat to speak turned up . Only my father and some journalists
went . It seemed that people had decided the Taliban were here to stay and they had better get along
with them .  ‘ When you are in the Taliban you have 100 per cent life security ,  ’ people would say . 
That ’ s why they volunteered their young men . The Taliban would come to peoples ’ houses , 
demanding money to buy Kalashnikovs , or they would ask them to hand over their sons to fight with
them . Many of the rich fled . The poor had no choice but to stay and survive the best they could . So
many of our men had gone to the mines or to the Gulf to work , leaving their families fatherless , the
sons were easy prey . 
The threats began to come closer to home . One day Ahmad Shah received a warning from unknown
people that they would kill him , so for a while he left for Islamabad to try to raise awareness there of
what was happening to our valley . One of the worst things about that period was when we started to
doubt one another . Fingers were even pointed at my father .  ‘ Our people are being killed , but this
Ziauddin is so outspoken and he ’ s still alive ! He must be a secret agent !  ’ Actually he had been
threatened too but hadn ’ t told us . He had given a press conference in Peshawar demanding that the
military act against the Taliban and go after their commanders . Afterwards people told him his name
was heard on Mullah FM in a threat from Shah Douran . 
My father brushed it off . But I was worried . He was outspoken and involved in so many groups and
committees that he often wouldn ’ t come home till midnight . He started to sleep at one of his friend ’ s
houses to protect us in case the Taliban came for him . He couldn ’ t bear the thought of being killed in
front of us . I could not sleep until he returned and I could lock the gate . When he was at home my
mother would place a ladder in the back yard up to the outside wall so he could get down to the street
below if he was in sudden danger . He laughed at the idea .  ‘ Maybe Atal the squirrel could make it but
not me !  ’ 
My mother was always trying to think up plans for what she would do if the Taliban came . She
thought of sleeping with a knife under her pillow . I said I could sneak into the toilet and call the
police . My brothers and I thought of digging a tunnel . Once again I prayed for a magic wand to make
the Taliban disappear . 
One day I saw my little brother Atal digging furiously in the garden .  ‘ What are you doing ?  ’ I asked
him .  ‘ Making a grave ,  ’ he said . Our news bulletins were full of killings and death so it was natural for
Atal to think of coffins and graves . Instead of hide and seek and cops and robbers , children were now
playing Army vs Taliban . They made rockets from branches and used sticks for Kalashnikovs ; these
were their sports of terror . 
There was no one to protect us . Our own deputy commissioner , Syed Javid , was going to Taliban
meetings , praying in their mosque and leading their meetings . He became a perfect talib . One target of
the Taliban were non-governmental organisations or NGOs , which they said were anti-Islam . When
the NGOs received threatening letters from the Taliban and went to the DC to ask for his help , he
wouldn ’ t even listen to them . Once in a meeting my father challenged him :  ‘ Whose orders are you
representing ? Fazlullah ’ s or the government ’ s ?  ’ We say in Arabic ,  ‘ People follow their king .  ’ When
the highest authority in your district joins the Taliban , then Talibanisation becomes normal . 
We like conspiracy theories in Pakistan and we had many . Some believed the authorities were
deliberately encouraging the Taliban . They said the army wanted the Taliban in Swat because the
Americans wanted to use an airbase there to launch their drones . With the Taliban in the valley , our
government could say to the Americans we can ’ t help you because we have our own problems . It was
also a way to answer growing American criticism that our military was helping the Taliban rather
than trying to stop them . Now our government could respond ,  ‘ You say we are taking your money and
aiding these terrorists , but if that ’ s the case why are they attacking us too ?  ’ 
 ‘ The Taliban obviously have the support of unseen forces ,  ’ said my father .  ‘ But what ’ s happening
is not simple , and the more you want to understand the more complex it becomes .  ’ 
That year , 2008 , the government even released Sufi Mohammad , the founder of the TNSM , from
prison . He was said to be more moderate than his son-in-law Fazlullah , and there was hope that he
would make a peace deal with the government to impose sharia law in Swat and release us from
Taliban violence . My father was in favour of this . We knew this would not be the end , but my father
argued that if we had shariat the Taliban would have nothing more to fight for . They should then put
down their arms and live like ordinary men . If they did not , he said , this would expose them for what
they really were . 
The army still had their guns trained on the mountains overlooking Mingora . We would lie in bed
listening to them boom boom all night . They would stop for five , ten or fifteen minutes and then start
again the moment we drifted off to sleep . Sometimes we covered our ears or buried our heads under
pillows , but the guns were close by and the noise was too loud to block out . Then the morning after , 
on TV , we would hear of more Taliban killings and wonder what the army was doing with all its
booming cannons and why they could not even stop the daily broadcasts on Mullah FM . 
Both the army and the Taliban were powerful . Sometimes their roadblocks were less than a
kilometre apart on the same main roads . They would stop us but seemed unaware of each other ’ s
presence . It was unbelievable . No one understood why we were not being defended . People would
say they were two sides of the same coin . My father said we common people were like chaff caught
between the two stones of a water mill . But he still wasn ’ t afraid . He said we should continue to
speak out . 
I am only human , and when I heard the guns my heart used to beat very fast . Sometimes I was very
afraid but I said nothing , and it didn ’ t mean I would stop going to school . But fear is very powerful
and in the end it was this fear that had made people turn against Shabana . Terror had made people
cruel . The Taliban bulldozed both our Pashtun values and the values of Islam . 
I tried to distract myself by reading Stephen Hawking ’ s A Brief History of Time , which answered
big questions such as how the universe began and whether time could run backwards . I was only
eleven years old and already I wished it could . 
We Pashtuns know the stone of revenge never decays , and when you do something wrong you will
face the music . But when would that be ? we continually asked ourselves .

The Diary of Gul Makai
IT WAS DURING one of those dark days that my father received a call from his friend Abdul Hai Kakar , 
a BBC radio correspondent based in Peshawar . He was looking for a female teacher or a schoolgirl
to write a diary about life under the Taliban . He wanted to show the human side of the catastrophe in
Swat . Initially Madam Maryam ’ s younger sister Ayesha agreed , but her father found out and refused
his permission saying it was too risky . 
When I overheard my father talking about this , I said ,  ‘ Why not me ?  ’ I wanted people to know what
was happening . Education is our right , I said . Just as it is our right to sing . Islam has given us this
right and says that every girl and boy should go to school . The Quran says we should seek knowledge , 
study hard and learn the mysteries of our world . 
I had never written a diary before and didn ’ t know how to begin . Although we had a computer , 
there were frequent power cuts and few places had Internet access . So Hai Kakar would call me in
the evening on my mother ’ s mobile . He used his wife ’ s phone to protect us as he said his own phone
was bugged by the intelligence services . He would guide me , asking me questions about my day , and
asking me to tell him small anecdotes or talk about my dreams . We would speak for half an hour or
forty-five minutes in Urdu , even though we are both Pashtun , as the blog was to appear in Urdu and he
wanted the voice to be as authentic as possible . Then he wrote up my words and once a week they
would appear on the BBC Urdu website . He told me about Anne Frank , a thirteen-year-old Jewish
girl who hid from the Nazis with her family in Amsterdam during the war . He told me she kept a diary
about their lives all cramped together , about how they spent their days and about her own feelings . It
was very sad as in the end the family was betrayed and arrested and Anne died in a concentration
camp when she was only fifteen . Later her diary was published and is a very powerful record . 
Hai Kakar told me it could be dangerous to use my real name and gave me the pseudonym Gul
Makai , which means ‘ cornflower ’ and is the name of the heroine in a Pashtun folk story . It ’ s a kind of
Romeo and Juliet story in which Gul Makai and Musa Khan meet at school and fall in love . But they
are from different tribes so their love causes a war . However , unlike Shakespeare ’ s play their story
doesn ’ t end in tragedy . Gul Makai uses the Quran to teach her elders that war is bad and they
eventually stop fighting and allow the lovers to unite . 
My first diary entry appeared on 3 January 2009 under the heading I AM AFRAID :  ‘ I had a terrible
dream last night filled with military helicopters and Taliban . I have had such dreams since the launch
of the military operation in Swat .  ’ I wrote about being afraid to go to school because of the Taliban
edict and looking over my shoulder all the time . I also described something that happened on my way
home from school :  ‘ I heard a man behind me saying ,  “ I will kill you .  ” I quickened my pace and after a
while I looked back to see if he was following me . To my huge relief I saw he was speaking on his
phone , he must have been talking to someone else .  ’ 
It was thrilling to see my words on the website . I was a bit shy to start with but after a while I got
to know the kind of things Hai Kakar wanted me to talk about and became more confident . He liked
personal feelings and what he called my ‘ pungent sentences ’ and also the mix of everyday family life
with the terror of the Taliban . 
I wrote a lot about school as that was at the centre of our lives . I loved my royal-blue school
uniform but we were advised to wear plain clothes instead and hide our books under our shawls . One
extract was called DO NOT WEAR COLOURFUL CLOTHES . In it I wrote ,  ‘ I was getting ready for school
one day and was about to put on my uniform when I remembered the advice of our principal , so that
day I decided to wear my favourite pink dress .  ’ 
I also wrote about the burqa . When you ’ re very young , you love the burqa because it ’ s great for
dressing up . But when you are made to wear it , that ’ s a different matter . Also it makes walking
difficult ! One of my diary entries was about an incident that happened when I was out shopping with
my mother and cousin in the Cheena Bazaar :  ‘ There we heard gossip that one day a woman was
wearing a shuttlecock burqa and fell over . When a man tried to help her she refused and said .  “ Don ’ t
help me , brother , as this will bring immense pleasure to Fazlullah .  ” When we entered the shop we
were going to , the shopkeeper laughed and told us he got scared thinking we might be suicide
bombers as many suicide bombers wore the burqa .  ’ 
At school people started talking about the diary . One girl even printed it out and brought it in to
show my father . 
 ‘ It ’ s very good ,  ’ he said with a knowing smile . 
I wanted to tell people it was me , but the BBC correspondent had told me not to as it could be
dangerous . I didn ’ t see why as I was just a child and who would attack a child ? But some of my
friends recognised incidents in it . And I almost gave the game away in one entry when I said ,  ‘ My
mother liked my pen name Gul Makai and joked to my father we should change my name .  .  . I also
like the name because my real name means “ grief-stricken ”  .  ’ 
The diary of Gul Makai received attention further afield . Some newspapers printed extracts . The
BBC even made a recording of it using another girl ’ s voice , and I began to see that the pen and the
words that come from it can be much more powerful than machine guns , tanks or helicopters . We
were learning how to struggle . And we were learning how powerful we are when we speak . 
Some of our teachers stopped coming to school . One said he had been ordered by Mullah Fazlullah
to help build his centre in Imam Deri . Another said he ’ d seen a beheaded corpse on the way in and
could no longer risk his life to teach . Many people were scared . Our neighbours said the Taliban
were instructing people to make it known to the mosque if their daughters were unmarried so they
could be married off , probably to militants . 
By the start of January 2009 there were only ten girls in my class when once there had been twentyseven . Many of my friends had left the valley so they could be educated in Peshawar , but my father
insisted we would not leave .  ‘ Swat has given us so much . In these tough days we must be strong for
our valley ,  ’ he said . 
One night we all went for dinner at the house of my father ’ s friend Dr Afzal , who runs a hospital . 
After dinner , when the doctor was driving us home , we saw masked Taliban on both sides of the road
carrying guns . We were terrified . Dr Afzal ’ s hospital was in an area that had been taken over by the
Taliban . The constant gunfire and curfews had made it impossible for the hospital to function , so he
had moved it to Barikot . There had been an outcry , and the Taliban spokesman Muslim Khan had
called on the doctor to reopen it . He had asked for my father ’ s advice . My father told him ,  ‘ Don ’ t
accept good things from bad people .  ’ A hospital protected by the Taliban was not a good idea so he
refused . 
Dr Afzal did not live far from us , so once we were safely home , my father insisted on going back
with him in case he was targeted by the Taliban . As he and my father drove back , Dr Afzal nervously
asked him ,  ‘ What names shall we give if they stop us ?  ’ 
 ‘ You are Dr Afzal and I am Ziauddin Yousafzai ,  ’ replied my father .  ‘ These bloody people . We
haven ’ t done anything wrong . Why should we change our names – that ’ s what criminals do .  ’ 
Fortunately the Taliban had disappeared . We all breathed a big sigh of relief when my father
phoned to say they were safe . 
I didn ’ t want to give in either . But the Taliban ’ s deadline was drawing closer : girls had to stop
going to school . How could they stop more than 50 , 000 girls from going to school in the twenty-first
century ? I kept hoping something would happen and the schools would remain open . But finally the
deadline was upon us . We were determined that the Khushal School bell would be the last to stop
ringing . Madam Maryam had even got married so she could stay in Swat . Her family had moved to
Karachi to get away from the conflict and , as a woman , she could not live alone . 
Wednesday 14 January was the day my school closed , and when I woke up that morning I saw TV
cameras in my bedroom . A Pakistani journalist called Irfan Ashraf was following me around , even as
I said my prayers and brushed my teeth . 
I could tell my father was in a bad mood . One of his friends had persuaded him to participate in a
documentary for the New York Times website to show the world what was happening to us . A few
weeks before , we had met the American video journalist Adam Ellick in Peshawar . It was a funny
meeting as he conducted a long interview with my father in English and I didn ’ t say a word . Then he
asked if he could talk to me and began asking questions using Irfan as an interpreter . After about ten
minutes of this he realised from my facial expressions that I could understand him perfectly .  ‘ You
speak English ?  ’ he asked me . 
 ‘ Yes , I was just saying there is a fear in my heart ,  ’ I replied . 
Adam was astonished .  ‘ What ’ s wrong with you people ?  ’ he asked Irfan and my father .  ‘ She speaks
better English than the rest of you and you ’ re translating for her !  ’ We all laughed . 
The original idea for the documentary had been to follow my father on the last day of school , but at
the end of the meeting Irfan asked me ,  ‘ What would you do if there comes a day when you can ’ t go
back to your valley and school ?  ’ I said this wouldn ’ t happen . Then he insisted and I started to weep . I
think it was then that Adam decided he should focus on me . 
Adam could not come to Swat because it was too dangerous for foreigners . When Irfan and a
cameraman arrived in Mingora , our uncle , who was staying with us , said over and over that it was too
risky to have cameras in our house . My father also kept telling them to hide the cameras . But they had
come a long way and it ’ s hard for us as Pashtuns to refuse hospitality . Besides , my father knew this
could be our megaphone to the outside world . His friend had told him it would make far more impact
than him roaming from pillar to post . 
I had done a lot of television interviews and enjoyed speaking into the microphone so much that my
friends would tease me . But I had never done anything like this .  ‘ Be natural ,  ’ Irfan told me . That
wasn ’ t easy with a camera trained on me everywhere I went even as I brushed my teeth . I showed
them the uniform I couldn ’ t wear and told them I was scared that if the Taliban caught me going to
school they would throw acid in my face as they had done to girls in Afghanistan . 
We had a special assembly that final morning but it was hard to hear with the noise of helicopters
overhead . Some of us spoke out against what was happening in our valley . The bell rang for the very
last time , and then Madam Maryam announced it was the winter holidays . But unlike in other years no
date was announced for the start of next term . Even so , some teachers still gave us homework . In the
yard I hugged all my friends . I looked at the honours board and wondered if my name would ever
appear on it again . Exams were due in March but how could they take place ? Coming first didn ’ t
matter if you couldn ’ t study at all . When someone takes away your pens you realise quite how
important education is . 
Before I closed the school door I looked back as if it were the last time I would ever be at school . 
That ’ s the closing shot in one part of the documentary . In reality I went back inside . My friends and I
didn ’ t want that day to end so we decided to stay on for a while longer . We went to the primary
school where there was more space to run around and played cops and robbers . Then we played
mango mango , where you make a circle and sing , then when the song stops everyone has to freeze . 
Anyone who moves or laughs is out . 
We came home from school late that day . Usually we leave at 1 p . m . but that day we stayed till
three . Before we left , Moniba and I had an argument over something so silly I can ’ t remember what it
was . Our friends couldn ’ t believe it .  ‘ You two always argue when there ’ s an important occasion !  ’ 
they said . It wasn ’ t a good way to leave things . 
I told the documentary makers ,  ‘ They cannot stop me . I will get my education if it ’ s at home , school
or somewhere else . This is our request to the world – to save our schools , save our Pakistan , save our
Swat .  ’ 
When I got home , I cried and cried . I didn ’ t want to stop learning . I was only eleven years old but I
felt as though I had lost everything . I had told everyone in my class that the Taliban wouldn ’ t go
through with it .  ‘ They ’ re just like our politicians – they talk the talk but they won ’ t do anything ,  ’ I ’ d
said . But then they went ahead and closed our school and I felt embarrassed . I couldn ’ t control
myself . I was crying , my mother was crying but my father insisted ,  ‘ You will go to school .  ’ 
For him the closing of the schools also meant the loss of business . The boys ’ school would reopen
after the winter holidays but the loss of the girls ’ school represented a big cut in our income . More
than half the school fees were overdue and my father spent the last day chasing money to pay the rent , 
the utility bills and the teachers ’ salaries . 
That night the air was full of artillery fire and I woke up three times . The next morning everything
had changed . I began to think that maybe I should go to Peshawar or abroad or maybe I could ask our
teachers to form a secret school in our home , as some Afghans had done during Taliban rule . 
Afterwards I went on as many radio and TV channels as possible .  ‘ They can stop us going to school
but they can ’ t stop us learning ,  ’ I said . I sounded hopeful but in my heart I was worried . My father and
I went to Peshawar and visited lots of places to tell people what was happening . I spoke of the irony
of the Taliban wanting female teachers and doctors for women yet not letting girls go to school to
qualify for these jobs . 
Once Muslim Khan had said girls should not go to school and learn Western ways . This from a man
who had lived so long in America ! He insisted he would have his own education system .  ‘ What
would Muslim Khan use instead of the stethoscope and the thermometer ?  ’ my father asked .  ‘ Are there
any Eastern instruments which will treat the sick ?  ’ The Taliban is against education because they
think that when a child reads a book or learns English or studies science he or she will become
Westernised . 
But I said ,  ‘ Education is education . We should learn everything and then choose which path to
follow .  ’ Education is neither Eastern nor Western , it is human . 
My mother used to tell me to hide my face when I spoke to the media because at my age I should be
in purdah and she was afraid for my safety . But she never banned me from doing anything . It was a
time of horror and fear . People often said the Taliban might kill my father but not me .  ‘ Malala is a
child ,  ’ they would say ,  ‘ and even the Taliban don ’ t kill children .  ’ 
But my grandmother wasn ’ t so sure . Whenever my grandmother saw me speaking on television , or
leaving the house she would pray ,  ‘ Please God make Malala like Benazir Bhutto but do not give her
Benazir ’ s short life .  ’ 
After my school closed down I continued to write the blog . Four days after the ban on girls ’ 
schools , five more were destroyed .  ‘ I am quite surprised ,  ’ I wrote ,  ‘ because these schools had closed
so why did they also need to be destroyed ? No one has gone to school following the Taliban ’ s
deadline . The army is doing nothing about it . They are sitting in their bunkers on top of the hills . They
slaughter goats and eat with pleasure .  ’ I also wrote about people going to watch the floggings
announced on Mullah FM , and the fact that the police were nowhere to be seen . 
One day we got a call from America , from a student at Stanford University . Her name was Shiza
Shahid and she came from Islamabad . She had seen the New York Times documentary Class
Dismissed in Swat Valley and tracked us down . We saw then the power of the media and she became
a great support to us . My father was almost bursting with pride at how I came across on the
documentary .  ‘ Look at her ,  ’ he told Adam Ellick .  ‘ Don ’ t you think she is meant for the skies ?  ’ Fathers
can be very embarrassing . 
Adam took us to Islamabad . It was the first time I had ever visited . Islamabad was a beautiful place
with nice white bungalows and broad roads , though it has none of the natural beauty of Swat . We saw
the Red Mosque where the siege had taken place , the wide , wide Constitution Avenue leading to the
white-colonnaded buildings of the Parliament House and the Presidency , where Zardari now lived . 
General Musharraf was in exile in London . 
We went to shops where I bought school books and Adam bought me DVDs of American TV
programmes like Ugly Betty , which was about a girl with big braces and a big heart . I loved it and
dreamed of one day going to New York and working on a magazine like her . We visited the Lok Virsa
museum , and it was a joy to celebrate our national heritage once again . Our own museum in Swat had
closed . On the steps outside an old man was selling popcorn . He was a Pashtun like us , and when my
father asked if he was from Islamabad he replied ,  ‘ Do you think Islamabad can ever belong to us
Pashtuns ?  ’ He said he came from Mohmand , one of the tribal areas , but had to flee because of a
military operation . I saw tears in my parents ’ eyes . 
Lots of buildings were surrounded by concrete blocks , and there were checkpoints for incoming
vehicles to guard against suicide bombs . When our bus hit a pothole on the way back my brother
Khushal , who had been asleep , jerked awake .  ‘ Was that a bomb blast ?  ’ he asked . This was the fear
that filled our daily lives . Any small disturbance or noise could be a bomb or gunfire . 
On our short trips we forgot our troubles in Swat . But we returned to the threats and danger as we
entered our valley once again . Even so , Swat was our home and we were not ready to leave it . 
Back in Mingora the first thing I saw when I opened my wardrobe was my uniform , school bag and
geometry set . I felt so sad . The visit to Islamabad had been a lovely break , but this was my reality
now .

A Funny Kind of Peace
WHEN MY BROTHERS ’ schools reopened after the winter break , Khushal said he would rather stay at
home like me . I was cross .  ‘ You don ’ t realise how lucky you are !  ’ I told him . It felt strange to have no
school . We didn ’ t even have a television set as someone had stolen ours while we were in Islamabad , 
using my father ’ s ‘ getaway ’ ladder to get inside . 
Someone gave me a copy of The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho , a fable about a shepherd boy who
travels to the Pyramids in search of treasure when all the time it ’ s at home . I loved that book and read
it over and over again .  ‘ When you want something all the universe conspires in helping you achieve
it ,  ’ it says . I don ’ t think that Paulo Coelho had come across the Taliban or our useless politicians . 
What I didn ’ t know was that Hai Kakar was holding secret talks with Fazlullah and his
commanders . He had got to know them in interviews , and was urging them to rethink their ban on
girls ’ education . 
 ‘ Listen , Maulana ,  ’ he told Fazlullah .  ‘ You killed people , you slaughtered people , you beheaded
people , you destroyed schools and still there was no protest in Pakistan . But when you banned girls ’ 
education people spoke out . Even the Pakistan media , which has been so soft on you till now , is
outraged .  ’ 
The pressure from the whole country worked , and Fazlullah agreed to lift the ban for girls up to ten
years old – Year 4 . I was in Year 5 and some of us pretended we were younger than we were . We
started going to school again , dressed in ordinary clothes and hiding our books under our shawls . It
was risky but it was the only ambition I had back then . We were lucky too that Madam Maryam was
brave and resisted the pressure to stop working . She had known my father since she was ten and they
trusted each other completely – she used to signal to him to wind up when he spoke for too long , 
which was often ! 
 ‘ The secret school is our silent protest ,  ’ she told us . 
I didn ’ t write anything about it in my diary . If they had caught us they would have flogged or even
slaughtered us as they had Shabana . Some people are afraid of ghosts , some of spiders or snakes – in
those days we were afraid of our fellow human beings . 
On the way to school I sometimes saw the Taliban with their caps and long dirty hair . Most of the
time they hid their faces . They were awkward , horrible-looking . The streets of Mingora were very
empty as a third of the inhabitants had left the valley . My father said you couldn ’ t really blame people
for leaving as the government had no power . There were now 12 , 000 army troops in the region – four
times as many as their estimates of the Taliban – along with tanks , helicopters and sophisticated
weapons . Yet seventy per cent of Swat was under Taliban control . 
About a week after we had returned to school , on 16 February 2009 , we were woken one night by
the sound of gunfire . Our people traditionally fire rifles in celebration of births and weddings but
even that had stopped during the conflict . So at first we thought we were in danger . Then we heard the
news . The gunfire was in celebration . A peace deal had been struck between the Taliban and the
provincial government , which was now under the control of the ANP , not the mullahs . The
government had agreed to impose sharia law throughout Swat and in return the militants would stop
fighting . The Taliban agreed to a ten-day truce and , as a peace gesture , released a Chinese telephone
engineer who they had kidnapped six months before . 
We were happy too – my father and I had often spoken in favour of a peace deal – but we
questioned how it would work . People hoped that the Taliban would settle down , go back to their
homes and live as peaceful citizens . They convinced themselves that the shariat in Swat would be
different to the Afghan version – we would still have our girls ’ schools and there would be no
morality police . Swat would be Swat just with a different justice system . I wanted to believe this but I
was worried . I thought , Surely how the system works depends on the people overseeing it ? The
Taliban . 
And it was hard to believe it was all over ! More than a thousand ordinary people and police had
been killed . Women had been kept in purdah , schools and bridges had been blown up , businesses had
closed . We had suffered barbaric public courts and violent justice and had lived in a constant state of
fear . And now it was all to stop . 
At breakfast I suggested to my brothers that we should talk of peace now and not of war . As ever , 
they ignored me and carried on with their war games . Khushal had a toy helicopter and Atal a pistol
made of paper , and one would shout ,  ‘ Fire !  ’ and the other ,  ‘ Take position .  ’ I didn ’ t care . I went and
looked at my uniform , happy that I would soon be able to wear it openly . A message came from our
headmistress that exams would take place in the first week of March . It was time to get back to my
books . 
Our excitement did not last long . Just two days later I was on the roof of the Taj Mahal Hotel
giving an interview about the peace deal to a well-known reporter called Hamid Mir when we got the
news that another TV reporter we knew had been killed . His name was Musa Khan Khel , and he had
often interviewed my father . That day he had been covering a peace march led by Sufi Mohammad . It
wasn ’ t really a march but a cavalcade of cars . Afterwards Musa Khan ’ s body was found nearby . He
had been shot several times and his throat partly slit . He was twenty-eight years old . 
My mother was so upset when we told her that she went to bed in tears . She was worried that
violence had returned to the valley so soon after the peace deal . Was the deal merely an illusion ? she
wondered . 
A few days later , on 22 February , a ‘ permanent ceasefire ’ was announced by Deputy
Commissioner Syed Javid at the Swat Press Club in Mingora . He appealed to all Swatis to return . 
The Taliban spokesman Muslim Khan then confirmed they had agreed an indefinite ceasefire . 
President Zardari would sign the peace deal into law . The government also agreed to pay
compensation to the families of victims . 
Everyone in Swat was jubilant , but I felt the happiest because it meant school would reopen
properly . The Taliban said girls could go to school after the peace agreement but they should be
veiled and covered . We said OK , if that ’ s what you want , as long as we can live our lives . 
Not everyone was happy about the deal . Our American allies were furious .  ‘ I think the Pakistan
government is basically abdicating to the Taliban and the extremists ,  ’ said Hillary Clinton , the US
Secretary of State . The Americans were worried the deal meant surrender . The Pakistani newspaper
Dawn wrote in an editorial that the deal sent ‘ a disastrous signal – fight the state militarily and it will
give you what you want and get nothing in return ’  . 
But none of those people had to live here . We needed peace whoever brought it . In our case it
happened to be a white-bearded militant called Sufi Mohammad . He made a ‘ peace camp ’ in Dir and
sat there in our famous mosque , Tabligh Markaz , like the master of our land . He was the guarantor that
the Taliban would lay down their arms and there would be peace in the valley . People visited him to
pay homage and kiss his hand because they were tired of war and suicide bombings . 
In March I stopped writing my blog as Hai Kakar thought there was not much more to say . But to
our horror things didn ’ t change much . If anything the Taliban became even more barbaric . They were
now state-sanctioned terrorists . We were disillusioned and disappointed . The peace deal was merely
a mirage . One night the Taliban held what we call a flag march near our street and patrolled the roads
with guns and sticks as if they were the army . 
They were still patrolling the Cheena Bazaar . One day my mother went shopping with my cousin as
she was getting married and wanted to buy things for her wedding . A talib accosted them and blocked
their way .  ‘ If I see you again wearing a scarf but no burqa I will beat you ,  ’ he said . My mother is not
easily scared and remained composed .  ‘ Yes , OK . We will wear burqas in future ,  ’ she told him . My
mother always covers her head but the burqa is not part of our Pashtun tradition . 
We also heard that Taliban had attacked a shopkeeper because an unaccompanied woman was
looking at the lipsticks in his beauty shop .  ‘ There is a banner in the market saying women are not
allowed to be in your shop unaccompanied by a male relative and you have defied us ,  ’ they said . He
was badly beaten and nobody helped him . 
One day I saw my father and his friends watching a video on his phone . It was a shocking scene . A
teenage girl wearing a black burqa and red trousers was lying face down on the ground being flogged
in broad daylight by a bearded man in a black turban .  ‘ Please stop it !  ’ she begged in Pashto in
between screams and whimpers as each blow was delivered .  ‘ In the name of Allah , I am dying !  ’ 
You could hear the Taliban shouting ,  ‘ Hold her down . Hold her hands down .  ’ At one point during
the flogging her burqa slips and they stop for a moment to adjust it then carry on beating her . They hit
her thirty-four times . A crowd had gathered but did nothing . One of the woman ’ s relatives even
volunteered to help hold her down . 
A few days later the video was everywhere . A woman film-maker in Islamabad got hold of it and it
was shown on Pakistan TV over and over , and then round the world . People were rightly outraged , 
but this reaction seemed odd to us as it showed they had no idea of the awful things going on in our
valley . I wished their outrage extended to the Taliban ’ s banning of girls ’ education . Prime Minister
Yusuf Raza Gilani called for an inquiry and made a statement saying the flogging of the girl was
against the teachings of Islam .  ‘ Islam teaches us to treat women politely ,  ’ he said . 
Some people even claimed the video was fake . Others said that the flogging had taken place in
January , before the peace deal , and had been released now to sabotage it . But Muslim Khan
confirmed it was genuine .  ‘ She came out of her house with a man who was not her husband so we had
to punish her ,  ’ he said .  ‘ Some boundaries cannot be crossed .  ’ 
Around the same time in early April another well-known journalist called Zahid Hussain came to
Swat . He went to visit the DC at his official residence and found him hosting what appeared to be a
celebration of the Taliban takeover . There were several senior Taliban commanders with armed
escorts including Muslim Khan and even Faqir Mohammad , the leader of the militants in Bajaur , who
were in the middle of a bloody fight with the army . Faqir had a $200 , 000 bounty on his head yet there
he was sitting in a government official ’ s house having dinner . We also heard that an army brigadier
went to prayers led by Fazlullah . 
 ‘ There cannot be two swords in one sheath ,  ’ said one of my father ’ s friends .  ‘ There cannot be two
kings in one land . Who is in charge here – the government or Fazlullah ?  ’ 
But we still believed in peace . Everyone was looking forward to a big outdoor public meeting on
20 April when Sufi Mohammad would address the people of Swat . 
We were all at home that morning . My father and brothers were standing outside when a group of
teenage Taliban went past playing victory songs on their mobiles .  ‘ Oh look at them , Aba ,  ’ said
Khushal .  ‘ If I had a Kalashnikov I would kill them .  ’ 
It was a perfect spring day . Everyone was excited because they hoped Sufi Mohammad would
proclaim peace and victory and ask the Taliban to lay down their arms . My father didn ’ t attend the
gathering . He watched it from the roof of Sarosh Academy , the school run by his friend Ahmad Shah
where he and other activists often gathered in the evenings . The roof overlooked the stage so some
media had set up their cameras there . 
There was a huge crowd – between 30 , 000 and 40 , 000 people – wearing turbans and singing
Taliban and jihadi songs .  ‘ It was complete Talibanisation humming ,  ’ said my father . Liberal
progressives like him did not enjoy the singing and chanting . They thought it was toxic , especially at
times like this . 
Sufi Mohammad was sitting on the stage with a long queue of people waiting to pay homage . The
meeting started with recitations from the Chapter of Victory – a surah from the Quran – followed by
speeches from different leaders in the five districts of our valley – Kohistan , Malakand , Shangla , 
Upper Dir and Lower Dir . They were all very enthusiastic as each one was hoping to be made the
amir of their district so they could be in charge of imposing shariat . Later these leaders would be
killed or thrown in jail , but back then they dreamed of power . So everyone spoke with great authority , 
celebrating like the Prophet when he conquered Mecca , though his speech was one of forgiveness not
cruel victory . 
Then it was Sufi Mohammad ’ s turn . He was not a good speaker . He was very old and seemed in
poor health and rambled on for forty-five minutes . He said totally unexpected things as if he had
someone else ’ s tongue in his mouth . He described Pakistan ’ s courts as un-Islamic and said ,  ‘ I
consider Western democracy a system imposed on us by the infidels . Islam does not allow democracy
or elections .  ’ 
Sufi Mohammad said nothing about education . He didn ’ t tell the Taliban to lay down their arms and
leave the hujras . Instead he appeared to threaten the whole nation .  ‘ Now wait , we are coming to
Islamabad ,  ’ he shouted . 
We were shocked . It was like when you pour water onto a blazing fire – the flames are suddenly
extinguished . People were bitterly disappointed and started abusing him .  ‘ What did that devil say ?  ’ 
people asked .  ‘ He ’ s not for peace ; he wants more killing .  ’ My mother put it best .  ‘ He had the chance
to be the hero of history but didn ’ t take it ,  ’ she said . Our mood on the way home was the exact
opposite of what we had felt on the way to the meeting . 
That night my father spoke on Geo TV and told Kamran Khan that people had had high hopes but
were disappointed . Sufi Mohammad didn ’ t do what he should have done . He was supposed to seal
the peace deal with a speech calling for reconciliation and an end to violence . 
People had different conspiracy theories about what had happened . Some said Sufi Mohammad had
gone mad . Others said he had been ordered to deliver this speech and been warned ,  ‘ If you don ’ t , 
there are four or five suicide bombers who will blast you and everyone there .  ’ People said he had
looked uneasy on stage before he spoke . They muttered about hidden hands and unseen forces . What
does it matter ? I wondered . The point is we are a Taliban state . 
My father was again busy speaking at seminars on our troubles with the Taliban . At one the
information minister for our province said Talibanisation was the result of our country ’ s policy of
training militants and sending them to Afghanistan , first to fight the Russians , then to fight the
Americans .  ‘ If we had not put guns in the hands of madrasa students at the behest of foreign powers
we would not be facing this bloodbath in the tribal areas and Swat ,  ’ he said . 
It soon became clear that the Americans had been right in their assessment of the deal . The Taliban
believed the Pakistani government had given in and they could do what they liked . They streamed into
Buner , the next district to the south-east of Swat and only sixty-five miles from Islamabad . People in
Buner had always resisted the Taliban but they were ordered by the local authorities not to fight . As
the militants arrived with their RPGs and guns , the police abandoned their posts , saying the Taliban
had ‘ superior weapons ’  , and people fled . The Taliban set up shariat courts in all districts and
broadcast sermons from mosques calling on the local youth to join them . 
Just as they had in Swat , they burned TV sets , pictures , DVDs and tapes . They even took control of
the famous shrine of a Sufi saint , Pir Baba , which was a pilgrimage site . People would visit to pray
for spiritual guidance , cures for their ailments and even happy marriages for their children . But now it
was locked and bolted . 
People in the lower districts of Pakistan became very worried as the Taliban moved towards the
capital . Everyone seemed to have seen the video of the girl in the black burqa being flogged and were
asking ,  ‘ Is this what we want in Pakistan ?  ’ Militants had killed Benazir , blown up the country ’ s bestknown hotel , killed thousands of people in suicide bombings and beheadings and destroyed hundreds
of schools . What more would it take for the army and government to resist them ? 
In Washington the government of President Obama had just announced it was sending 21 , 000 more
troops to Afghanistan to turn round the war against the Taliban . But now they seemed to be more
alarmed about Pakistan than Afghanistan . Not because of girls like me and my school but because our
country has more than 200 nuclear warheads and they were worried about who was going to control
them . They talked about stopping their billions of dollars in aid and sending troops instead . 
At the start of May our army launched Operation True Path to drive the Taliban out of Swat . We
heard they were dropping hundreds of commandos from helicopters into the mountains in the north . 
More troops appeared in Mingora too . This time they would clear the town . They announced over
megaphones that all residents should leave . 
My father said we should stay . But the gunfire kept us awake most nights . Everyone was in a
continuous state of anxiety . One night we were woken up by screaming . We had recently got some
pets – three white chickens and a white rabbit that one of Khushal ’ s friends had given him and which
we let wander around the house . Atal was only five then and really loved that rabbit so it used to
sleep under my parents ’ bed . But it used to wee everywhere so that night we put it outside . Around
midnight a cat came and killed it . We all heard the rabbit ’ s agonised cries . Atal would not stop
weeping .  ‘ Let the sun come and I will teach that cat a lesson tomorrow ,  ’ he said .  ‘ I will kill him .  ’ It
seemed like a bad omen .

Leaving the Valley
LEAVING THE VALLEY was harder than anything I had done before . I remembered the tapa my
grandmother used to recite :  ‘ No Pashtun leaves his land of his own sweet will .  / Either he leaves from
poverty or he leaves for love .  ’ Now we were being driven out for a third reason the tapa writer had
never imagined – the Taliban . 
Leaving our home felt like having my heart ripped out . I stood on our roof looking at the mountains , 
the snow-topped Mount Elum where Alexander the Great had reached up and touched Jupiter . I
looked at the trees all coming into leaf . The fruit of our apricot tree might be eaten by someone else
this year . Everything was silent , pin-drop silent . There was no sound from the river or the wind ; even
the birds were not chirping . 
I wanted to cry because I felt in my heart I might never see my home again . The documentary
makers had asked me how I would feel if one day I left Swat and never came back . At the time I had
thought it was a stupid question , but now I saw that everything I could not imagine happening had
happened . I thought my school would not close and it had . I thought we would never leave Swat and
we were just about to . I thought Swat would be free of the Taliban one day and we would rejoice , but
now I realised that might not happen . I started to cry . It was as if everyone had been waiting for
someone else to start . My cousin ’ s wife , Honey , started weeping , then all of us were crying . But my
mother was very composed and courageous . 
I put all my books and notebooks in my school bag then packed another bag of clothes . I couldn ’ t
think straight . I took the trousers from one set and the top from another so I had a bag of things which
didn ’ t match . I didn ’ t take any of my school awards or photos or personal belongings as we were
travelling in someone else ’ s car and there was little room . We didn ’ t own anything expensive like a
laptop or jewellery – our only valuable items had been our TV , a fridge and a washing machine . We
didn ’ t lead a life of luxury – we Pashtuns prefer to sit on floors rather than chairs . Our house has
holes in the walls , and every plate and cup is cracked . 
My father had resisted leaving till the end . But then some of my parents ’ friends had lost a relative
in gunfire so they went to the house to offer prayers of condolences even though nobody was really
venturing out . Seeing their grief made my mother determined to leave . She told my father ,  ‘ You don ’ t
have to come , but I am going and I will take the children to Shangla .  ’ She knew he couldn ’ t let her go
alone . My mother had had enough of the gunfire and tension and called Dr Afzal and begged him to
persuade my father to leave . He and his family were going so they offered us a lift . We didn ’ t have a
car so we were lucky that our neighbours , Safina and her family , were also leaving and could fit some
of us in their car while the rest would go with Dr Afzal . 
On 5 May 2009 we became IDPs . Internally displaced persons . It sounded like a disease . 
There were a lot of us – not just us five but also my grandmother , my cousin , his wife , Honey , and
their baby . My brothers also wanted to take their pet chickens – mine had died because I washed it in
cold water on a winter ’ s day . It wouldn ’ t revive even when I put it in a shoebox in the house to keep
it warm and got everyone in the neighbourhood to pray for it . My mother refused to let the chickens
come . What if they make a mess in the car ? she asked . Atal suggested we buy them nappies ! In the end
we left them with a lot of water and corn . She also said I must leave my school bag because there was
so little room . I was horrified . I went and whispered Quranic verses over the books to try and protect
them . 
Finally everyone was ready . My mother , father , grandmother , my cousin ’ s wife and baby and my
brothers all squashed into the back of Dr Afzal ’ s van along with his wife and children . There were
children in the laps of adults and smaller children in their laps . I was luckier – there were fewer
people in Safina ’ s car – but I was devastated by the loss of my school bag . Because I had packed my
books separately , I had had to leave them all behind . 
We all said surahs from the Quran and a special prayer to protect our sweet homes and school . 
Then Safina ’ s father put his foot on the pedal and away we drove out of the small world of our street , 
home and school and into the unknown . We did not know if we would ever see our town again . We
had seen pictures of how the army had flattened everything in an operation against militants in Bajaur
and we thought everything we knew would be destroyed . 
The streets were jam-packed . I had never seen them so busy before . There were cars everywhere , 
as well as rickshaws , mule carts and trucks laden with people and their belongings . There were even
motorbikes with entire families balanced on them . Thousands of people were leaving with just the
clothes they had on their backs . It felt as if the whole valley was on the move . Some people believe
that the Pashtuns descend from one of the lost tribes of Israel , and my father said ,  ‘ It is as though we
are the Israelites leaving Egypt , but we have no Moses to guide us .  ’ Few people knew where they
were going , they just knew they had to leave . This was the biggest exodus in Pashtun history . 
Usually there are many ways out of Mingora , but the Taliban had cut down several huge apple trees
and used them to block some routes so everyone was squashed onto the same road . We were an ocean
of people . The Taliban patrolled the roads with guns and watched us from the tops of buildings . They
were keeping the cars in lines but with weapons not whistles .  ‘ Traffic Taliban ,  ’ we joked to try and
keep our spirits up . At regular intervals along the road we passed army and Taliban checkpoints side
by side . Once again the army was seemingly unaware of the Taliban ’ s presence . 
 ‘ Maybe they have poor eyesight ,  ’ we laughed ,  ‘ and can ’ t see them .  ’ 
The road was heaving with traffic . It was a long slow journey and we were all very sweaty
crammed in together . Usually car journeys are an adventure for us children as we rarely go anywhere . 
But this was different . Everyone was depressed . 
Inside Dr Afzal ’ s van my father was talking to the media , giving a running commentary on the
exodus from the valley . My mother kept telling him to keep his voice down for fear the Taliban would
hear him . My father ’ s voice is so loud my mother often jokes that he doesn ’ t need to make phone
calls , he can just shout . 
Finally we got through the mountain pass at Malakand and left Swat behind . It was late afternoon
by the time we reached Mardan , which is a hot and busy city . 
My father kept insisting to everyone ‘ in a few days we will return . Everything will be fine .  ’ But we
knew that was not true . 
In Mardan there were already big camps of white UNHCR tents like those for Afghan refugees in
Peshawar . We weren ’ t going to stay in the camps because it was the worst idea ever . Almost two
million of us were fleeing Swat and you couldn ’ t have fitted two million people in those camps . Even
if there was a tent for us , it was far too hot inside and there was talk that diseases like cholera were
spreading . My father said he had heard rumours that some Taliban were even hiding inside the camps
and harassing the women . 
Those who could , stayed in the homes of local people or with family and friends . Amazingly threequarters of all the IDPs were put up by the people of Mardan and the nearby town of Swabi . They
opened the doors of their homes , schools and mosques to the refugees . In our culture women are
expected not to mix with men they are not related to . In order to protect women ’ s purdah , men in
families hosting the refugees even slept away from their own homes . They became voluntary IDPs . It
was an astonishing example of Pashtun hospitality . We were convinced that if the exodus had been
managed by the government many more would have died of hunger and illness . 
As we had no relatives in Mardan we were planning to make our way to Shangla , our family
village . So far we had driven in the opposite direction , but we had had to take the only lift we could
get out of Swat . 
We spent that first night in the home of Dr Afzal . My father then left us to go to Peshawar and alert
people to what was happening . He promised to meet us later in Shangla . My mother tried very hard to
persuade him to come with us but he refused . He wanted the people of Peshawar and Islamabad to be
aware of the terrible conditions in which IDPs were living and that the military were doing nothing . 
We said goodbye and were terribly worried we wouldn ’ t see him again . 
The next day we got a lift to Abbottabad , where my grandmother ’ s family lived . There we met up
with my cousin Khanjee , who was heading north like us . He ran a boys ’ hostel in Swat and was taking
seven or eight boys to Kohistan by coach . He was going to Besham , from where we would need
another lift to take us to Shangla . 
It was nightfall by the time we reached Besham as many roads were blocked . We spent the night in
a cheap dirty hotel while my cousin tried to arrange a van to take us to Shangla . A man came near my
mother and she took her shoe off and hit him once then twice and he ran away . She had hit him so hard
that when she looked at the shoe it was broken . I always knew my mother was a strong woman but I
looked at her with new respect . 
It was not easy to get from Besham to our village and we had to walk twenty-five kilometres
carrying all our things . At one point we were stopped by the army , who told us we could go no further
and must turn back .  ‘ Our home is in Shangla . Where will we go ?  ’ we begged . My grandmother started
crying and saying her life had never been so bad . Finally , they let us through . The army and their
machine guns were everywhere . Because of the curfew and the checkpoints there was not one other
vehicle on the road that didn ’ t belong to the military . We were afraid that the army wouldn ’ t know
who we were and would shoot us . 
When we reached the village our family was astonished to see us . Everyone believed the Taliban
would return to Shangla so they couldn ’ t understand why we hadn ’ t remained in Mardan . 
We stayed in my mother ’ s village , Karshat , with my uncle Faiz Mohammad and his family . We had
to borrow clothes from our relatives as we hadn ’ t brought much . I was happy to be with my cousin
Sumbul , who is a year older than me . Once we were settled I started going to school with her . I was
in Year 6 but started in Year 7 to be with Sumbul . There were only three girls in that year as most of
the village girls of that age do not go to school , so we were taught with boys as they didn ’ t have
enough room or staff to teach just three girls separately . I was different to the other girls as I didn ’ t
cover my face and I used to talk to every teacher and ask questions . But I tried to be obedient and
polite , always saying ,  ‘ Yes , sir .  ’ 
It took over half an hour to walk to school , and because I am bad at getting up in the morning the
second day we were late . I was shocked when the teacher hit my hand with a stick to punish me , but
then decided that at least it meant they were accepting me and not treating me differently . My uncle
even gave me pocket money to buy snacks at school – they sold cucumber and watermelon not sweets
and crisps like in Mingora . 
One day at school there was a parents ’ day and prize-giving ceremony , and all the boys were
encouraged to make speeches . Some of the girls also took part , but not in public . Instead we spoke
into a microphone in our classrooms and our voices were then projected into the main hall . But I was
used to speaking in public so I came out and in front of all the boys I recited one naat , a poem in
which I praised the Prophet . Then I asked the teacher if I could read some more poetry . I read a poem
about working hard to achieve your heart ’ s desires .  ‘ A diamond must be cut many times before it
yields even a tiny jewel ,  ’ I said . After that I spoke of my namesake , Malalai of Maiwand , who had
strength and power equal to hundreds and thousands of brave men because her few lines of poetry
changed everything so the British were defeated . 
People in the audience seemed surprised and I wondered whether they thought I was showing off or
whether they were asking themselves why I wasn ’ t wearing a veil . 
It was nice being with my cousins but I missed my books . I kept thinking of my school bag at home
with copies of Oliver Twist and Romeo and Juliet waiting to be read and the Ugly Betty DVDs on the
shelf . But now we were living our own drama . We had been so happy , then something very bad had
come into our lives and we were now waiting for our happy ending . When I complained about my
books my brothers whined about their chickens . 
We ’ d heard on the radio that the army had started the battle for Mingora . They had parachuted in
soldiers and there had been hand-to-hand fighting in the streets . The Taliban were using hotels and
government buildings as bunkers . After four days the military took three squares including Green
Chowk , where the Taliban used to display the beheaded bodies of their victims . Then they captured
the airport and in a week they had taken back the city . 
We continued to worry about my father . In Shangla it was hard to find a mobile phone signal . We
had to climb onto a huge boulder in a field , and even then we rarely had more than one bar of
reception so we hardly ever spoke to him . But after we had been in Shangla for about six weeks , my
father said we could travel to Peshawar , where he had been staying in one room with three friends . 
It was very emotional to see him again . Then , a complete family once more , we travelled down to
Islamabad , where we stayed with the family of Shiza , the lady who had called us from Stanford . 
While we were there we heard that Ambassador Richard Holbrooke , the American envoy to Pakistan
and Afghanistan , was holding a meeting in the Serena Hotel about the conflict , and my father and I
managed to get inside . 
We almost missed it as I hadn ’ t set the alarm properly so my father was barely speaking to me . 
Holbrooke was a big gruff man with a red face but people said he had helped bring peace to Bosnia . I
sat next to him and he asked me how old I was .  ‘ I am twelve ,  ’ I replied , trying to look as tall as
possible .  ‘ Respected Ambassador , I request you , please help us girls to get an education ,  ’ I said . 
He laughed .  ‘ You already have lots of problems and we are doing lots for you ,  ’ he replied .  ‘ We
have pledged billions of dollars in economic aid ; we are working with your government on providing
electricity , gas .  .  . but your country faces a lot of problems .  ’ 
I did an interview with a radio station called Power 99 . They liked it very much and told us they
had a guesthouse in Abbottabad where we could all go . We stayed there for a week and to my joy I
heard Moniba was also in Abbottabad , as was one of our teachers and another friend . Moniba and I
had not spoken since our fight on the last day before becoming IDPs . We arranged to meet in a park , 
and I brought her Pepsi and biscuits .  ‘ It was all your fault ,  ’ she told me . I agreed . I didn ’ t mind ; I just
wanted to be friends . 
Our week at the guesthouse soon ended and we went to Haripur , where one of my aunts lived . It
was our fourth city in two months . I knew we were better off than those who lived in the camps , 
queuing for food and water for hours under the hot sun , but I missed my valley . It was there I spent my
twelfth birthday . Nobody remembered . Even my father forgot , he was so busy hopping about . I was
upset and recalled how different my eleventh birthday had been . I had shared a cake with my friends . 
There were balloons and I had made the same wish I was making on my twelfth birthday , but this time
there was no cake and there were no candles to blow out . Once again I wished for peace in our
valley .

The Valley of Sorrows
IT ALL SEEMED like a bad dream . We had been away from our valley for almost three months and as
we drove back past
Churchill ’ s Picket , past the ancient ruins on the hill and the giant Buddhist stupa , we saw the wide
Swat River and my father began to weep . Swat seemed to be under complete military control . The
vehicle we were in even had to pass through an explosives check before we could head up the
Malakand Pass . Once we got over the other side and down into the valley it seemed there were army
checkpoints everywhere and soldiers had made nests for their machine guns on so many of the
rooftops . 
As we drove through villages we saw buildings in ruins and burned-out vehicles . It made me think
of old war movies or the video games my brother Khushal loves to play . When we reached Mingora
we were shocked . The army and Taliban had fought street to street and almost every wall was
pockmarked with bullet holes . There was the rubble of blown-up buildings which the Taliban had
used as hideouts , and piles of wreckage , twisted metal and smashed-up signs . Most of the shops had
heavy metal shutters ; those that didn ’ t had been looted . The city was silent and emptied of people and
traffic as if a plague had descended . The strangest sight of all was the bus station . Usually it ’ s a
complete confusion of Flying Coaches and rickshaws , but now it was completely deserted . We even
saw plants growing up through the cracks in the paving . We had never seen our city like this . 
At least there was no sign of the Taliban . 
It was 24 July 2009 , a week after our prime minister had announced that the Taliban had been
cleared out . He promised that the gas supply had been restored and that the banks were reopening , and
called on the people of Swat to return . In the end as many as half of its 1 . 8 million population had left
our valley . From what we could see , most of them weren ’ t convinced it was safe to return . 
As we drew close to home we all fell silent , even my little brother , Atal the chatterbox . Our home
was near Circuit House , the army headquarters , so we were worried it might have been destroyed in
the shelling . We ’ d also heard that many homes had been looted . We held our breath as my father
unlocked the gate . The first thing we saw was that in the three months we ’ d been away the garden had
become a jungle . 
My brothers immediately rushed off to check on their pet chickens . They came back crying . All that
remained of the chickens was a pile of feathers and the bones of their small bodies entangled as if
they had died in an embrace . They had starved to death . 
I felt so sad for my brothers but I had to check on something of my own . To my joy I found my
school bag still packed with my books , and I gave thanks that my prayers had been answered and that
they were safe . I took out my books one by one and just stared at them . Maths , physics , Urdu , English , 
Pashto , chemistry , biology , Islamiyat , Pakistan studies . Finally I would be able to return to school
without fear . 
Then I went and sat on my bed . I was overwhelmed . 
We were lucky our house had not been broken into . Four or five of the houses on our street had
been looted and TVs and gold jewellery had been taken . Safina ’ s mother next door had deposited her
gold in a bank vault for safekeeping and even that had been looted . 
My father was anxious to check on the school . I went with him . We found that the building opposite
the girls ’ school had been hit by a missile but the school itself looked intact . For some reason my
father ’ s keys would not work so we found a boy who climbed over the wall and opened it from the
inside . We ran up the steps anticipating the worst . 
 ‘ Someone has been in here ,  ’ my father said as soon as we entered the courtyard . There were
cigarette stubs and empty food wrappers all over the floor . Chairs had been upended and the space
was a mess . My father had taken down the Khushal School sign and left it in the courtyard . It was
leaning against the wall and I screamed as we lifted it . Underneath were the rotting heads of goats . It
looked like the remains of someone ’ s dinner . 
Then we went into the classrooms . Anti-Taliban slogans were scrawled all over the walls . 
Someone had written army zindabad ( Long live the army ) on a whiteboard in permanent marker . Now
we knew who had been living there . One soldier had even written corny love poems in one of my
classmate ’ s diaries . Bullet casings littered the floor . The soldiers had made a hole in the wall through
which you could see the city below . Maybe they had even shot at people through that hole . I felt sorry
that our precious school had become a battlefield . 
While we were looking around we heard someone banging on the door downstairs .  ‘ Don ’ t open it , 
Malala !  ’ my father ordered . 
In his office my father found a letter left by the army . It blamed citizens like us for allowing the
Taliban to control Swat .  ‘ We have lost so many of the precious lives of our soldiers and this is due to
your negligence . Long live Pak Army ,  ’ he read . 
 ‘ This is typical ,  ’ he said .  ‘ We people of Swat were first seduced by the Taliban , then killed by
them and now blamed for them . Seduced , killed and blamed .  ’ 
In some ways the army did not seem very different to the militants . One of our neighbours told us he
had even seen them leaving the bodies of dead Taliban in the streets for all to see . Now their
helicopters flew in pairs overhead like big black buzzing insects , and when we walked home we
stayed close to the walls so they wouldn ’ t see us . 
We heard that thousands of people had been arrested including boys as young as eight who had
been brainwashed to train for suicide bombing missions . The army was sending them to a special
camp for jihadis to de-radicalise them . One of the people arrested was our old Urdu teacher who had
refused to teach girls and had instead gone to help Fazlullah ’ s men collect and destroy CDs and
DVDs . 
Fazlullah himself was still at large . The army had destroyed his headquarters in Imam Deri and
then claimed to have him surrounded in the mountains of Peochar . Then they said he was badly
injured and that they had his spokesman , Muslim Khan , in custody . Later the story changed and they
reported that Fazlullah had escaped into Afghanistan and was in the province of Kunar . Some people
said that Fazlullah had been captured but that the army and the ISI couldn ’ t agree on what to do with
him . The army had wanted to imprison him , but the intelligence service had prevailed and taken him
to Bajaur so that he could slip across the border to Afghanistan . 
Muslim Khan and another commander called Mehmud seemed to be the only members of the
Taliban leadership who were in custody – all the others were still free . As long as Fazlullah was still
around I was afraid the Taliban would regroup and return to power . I sometimes had nightmares , but
at least his radio broadcasts had stopped . 
My father ’ s friend Ahmad Shah called it a ‘ controlled peace , not a durable peace ’  . But gradually
people returned to the valley because Swat is beautiful and we cannot bear to be away from it for
long . 
Our school bell rang again for the first time on 1 August . It was wonderful to hear that sound and run
through the doorway and up the steps as we used to . I was overjoyed to see all my old friends . We
had so many stories from our time as IDPs . Most of us had stayed with friends or family but some had
been in the camps . We knew we were lucky . Many children had to have their classes in tents because
the Taliban had destroyed their schools . And one of my friends , Sundus , had lost her father , who had
been killed in an explosion . 
It seemed like everyone knew I had written the BBC diary . Some thought my father had done it for
me but Madam Maryam , our principal , told them ,  ‘ No . Malala is not just a good speaker but also a
good writer .  ’ 
That summer there was only one topic of conversation in my class . Shiza Shahid , our friend from
Islamabad , had finished her studies in Stanford and invited twenty-seven girls from the Khushal
School to spend a few days in the capital seeing the sights and taking part in workshops to help us get
over the trauma of living under the Taliban . Those from my class were me , Moniba , Malka-e-Noor , 
Rida , Karishma and Sundus , and we were chaperoned by my mother and Madam Maryam . 
We left for the capital on Independence Day , 14 August , and travelled by bus , everyone brimming
with excitement . Most of the girls had only ever left the valley when we became IDPs . This was
different and very much like the holidays we read about in novels . We stayed in a guesthouse and did
lots of workshops on how to tell our stories so people outside would know what was going on in our
valley and help us . Right from the first session I think Shiza was surprised how strong-willed and
vocal we all were .  ‘ It ’ s a room full of Malalas !  ’ she told my father . 
We also had fun doing things like going to the park and listening to music , which might seem
ordinary for most people but which in Swat had become acts of political protest . And we saw the
sights . We visited the Faisal Mosque at the base of the Margalla Hills , which was built by the Saudis
for millions of rupees . It is huge and white and looks like a shimmering tent suspended between
minarets . We went on our first ever visit to the theatre to see an English play called Tom , Dick and
Harry and had art classes . We ate at restaurants and had our first visit to a McDonald ’ s . There were
lots of firsts although I had to miss a meal in a Chinese restaurant because I was on a TV show called
Capital Talk . To this day I still haven ’ t got to try duck pancakes ! 
Islamabad was totally different to Swat . It was as different for us as Islamabad is to New York . 
Shiza introduced us to women who were lawyers and doctors and also activists , which showed us
that women could do important jobs yet still keep their culture and traditions . We saw women in the
streets without purdah , their heads completely uncovered . I stopped wearing my shawl over my head
in some of the meetings , thinking I had become a modern girl . Later I realised that simply having your
head uncovered isn ’ t what makes you modern . 
We were there one week and predictably Moniba and I quarrelled . She saw me gossiping with a
girl in the year above and told me ,  ‘ Now you are with Resham and I am with Rida .  ’ 
Shiza wanted to introduce us to influential people . In our country of course this often means the
military . One of our meetings was with Major General Athar Abbas , the chief spokesman for the army
and its head of public relations . We drove to Islamabad ’ s twin city of Rawalpindi to see him in his
office . Our eyes widened when we saw that the army headquarters was so much neater than the rest of
the city with perfect green lawns and blossoming flowers . Even the trees were all the same size with
the trunks painted white to exactly halfway up – we didn ’ t know why . Inside the HQ we saw offices
with banks of televisions , men monitoring every channel , and one officer showed my father a thick
file of cuttings which contained every mention of the army in that day ’ s papers . He was amazed . The
army seemed much more effective at PR than our politicians . 
We were taken into a hall to wait for the general . On the walls were photographs of all our army
chiefs , the most powerful men in our country including dictators like Musharraf and scary Zia . A
servant with white gloves brought us tea and biscuits and small meat samosas that melted in our
mouths . When General Abbas came in we all stood up . 
He began by telling us about the military operation in Swat , which he presented as a victory . He
said 128 soldiers and 1 , 600 terrorists had been killed in the operation . 
After he finished we could ask questions . We had been told to prepare questions in advance and I
had made a list of seven or eight . Shiza had laughed and said he wouldn ’ t be able to answer so many . 
I sat in the front row and was the first to be called on . I asked ,  ‘ Two or three months ago you told us
Fazlullah and his deputy were shot and injured , and then you said they were in Swat and sometimes
you say they ’ re in Afghanistan . How did they get there ? If you have so much information , why can ’ t
you catch them ?  ’ 
His reply went on for about ten to fifteen minutes and I couldn ’ t work out what his answer was ! 
Then I asked about reconstruction .  ‘ The army must do something for the future of the valley , not just
focus on the military operation ,  ’ I said . 
Moniba asked something similar .  ‘ Who will reconstruct all these buildings and schools ?  ’ she
wanted to know . 
The general replied in a very military way .  ‘ After the operation , first we will have recovery , then
rehabilitation , then hold and transfer to civil authorities .  ’ 
All of us girls made it clear that we wanted to see the Taliban brought to justice , but we weren ’ t
very convinced this would happen . 
Afterwards General Abbas gave some of us his visiting card and told us to contact him if we ever
needed anything . 
On the last day we all had to give a speech at the Islamabad Club about our experiences in the
valley under Taliban rule . When Moniba spoke she couldn ’ t control her tears . Soon everyone was
weeping . We had enjoyed a glimpse of a different life in Islamabad . In my speech I told the audience
that until I had watched the English play I had no idea there were so many talented people in Pakistan . 
 ‘ Now we realise we don ’ t need to watch Indian movies ,  ’ I joked . We ’ d had a wonderful time , and
when we got back to Swat I felt so hopeful about the future I planted a mango seed in the garden
during Ramadan as they are a favourite fruit to eat after breaking the fast . 
But my father had a big problem . While we had been IDPs and for all the months the school had
been closed he had collected no fees , but the teachers still expected to be paid . Altogether that would
be over one million rupees . All the private schools were in the same boat . One school gave its
teachers salaries for a month , but most didn ’ t know what to do as they couldn ’ t afford to pay . The
teachers at the Khushal School demanded something . They had their own expenses , and one of them , 
Miss Hera , was about to get married and had been relying on her salary to help pay for the ceremony . 
My father was in a fix . Then we remembered General Abbas and his visiting card . It was because
of the army operation to expel the Taliban that we had all had to leave and found ourselves in this
situation now . So Madam Maryam and I wrote an email to General Abbas explaining the situation . He
was very kind and sent us 1 , 100 , 000 rupees so my father could pay everyone three months ’ back pay . 
The teachers were so happy . Most had never received so much money at once . Miss Hera called my
father in tears , grateful that her wedding could go ahead as planned . 
This didn ’ t mean we went easy on the army . We were very unhappy about the army ’ s failure to
capture the Taliban leadership , and my father and I continued to give lots of interviews . We were
often joined by my father ’ s friend Zahid Khan , a fellow member of the Swat Qaumi Jirga . He was
also the president of the All Swat Hotels Association , so he was particularly eager for life to go back
to normal so that tourists could return . Like my father he was very outspoken and had been threatened
too . One night in November 2009 he had had a very narrow escape . Zahid Khan was returning to his
home from a meeting with army officials at Circuit House late at night when he was ambushed . 
Fortunately , many of his family live in the same area and they exchanged fire with the attackers , 
forcing them to flee . 
Then on 1 December 2009 there was a suicide attack on a well-known local ANP politician and
member of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa assembly , Dr Shamsher Ali Khan . He had been greeting friends
and constituents for Eid at his hujra , just a mile from Imam Deri where Fazlullah ’ s headquarters had
been , when the bomb went off . Dr Shamsher had been an outspoken critic of the Taliban . He died on
the spot and nine other people were injured . People said the bomber was about eighteen years old . 
The police found his legs and other parts of his body . 
A couple of weeks after that our school was asked to take part in the District Child Assembly
Swat , which had been set up by the charity UNICEF and by the Khpal Kor ( My Home ) Foundation for
orphans . Sixty students from all over Swat had been chosen as members . They were mostly boys
although eleven girls from my school went along . The first meeting was in a hall with lots of
politicians and activists . We held an election for speaker and I won ! It was strange to stand up there
on the stage and have people address me as Madam Speaker , but it felt good to have our voices heard . 
The assembly was elected for a year and we met almost every month . We passed nine resolutions
calling for an end to child labour and asking for help to send the disabled and street children to
school , as well as for the reconstruction of all the schools destroyed by the Taliban . Once the
resolutions were agreed , they were sent to officials and a handful were even acted on . 
Moniba , Ayesha and I also started learning about journalism from a British organisation called the
Institute for War and Peace Reporting , which ran a project called Open Minds Pakistan . It was fun
learning how to report issues properly . I had become interested in journalism after seeing how my
own words could make a difference and also from watching the Ugly Betty DVDs about life at an
American magazine . This was a bit different – when we wrote about subjects close to our hearts these
were topics like extremism and the Taliban rather than clothes and hairstyles . 
All too soon it was another year of exams . I beat Malka-e-Noor for first place again although it
was close . Our headmistress had tried to persuade her to be a school prefect but she said she couldn ’ t
do anything that might distract her from her studies .  ‘ You should be more like Malala and do other
things ,  ’ said Madam Maryam .  ‘ It ’ s just as important as your education . Work isn ’ t everything .  ’ But I
couldn ’ t blame her . She really wanted to please her parents , particularly her mother . 
It wasn ’ t the same Swat as before – maybe it never would be – but it was returning to normal . Even
some of the dancers of Banr Bazaar had moved back , although they were mostly making DVDs to sell , 
rather than performing live . We enjoyed peace festivals with music and dancing , unheard of under the
Taliban . My father organised one of the festivals in Marghazar and invited those who had hosted the
IDPs in the lower districts as a thank you . There was music all night long . 
Things often seemed to happen around my birthday , and around the time I turned thirteen in July
2010 the rain came . We normally don ’ t have monsoons in Swat and at first we were happy , thinking
the rain would mean a good harvest . But it was relentless and so heavy that you couldn ’ t even see the
person standing in front of you . Environmentalists had warned that our mountains had been stripped of
trees by the Taliban and timber smugglers . Soon muddy floods were raging down the valleys , 
sweeping away everything in their wake . 
We were in school when the floods started and were sent home . But there was so much water that
the bridge across the dirty stream was submerged so we had to find another way . The next bridge we
came to was also submerged but the water wasn ’ t too deep so we splashed our way across . It smelt
foul . We were wet and filthy by the time we got home . 
The next day we heard that the school had been flooded . It took days for the water to drain away
and when we returned we could see chest-high tide marks on the walls . There was mud , mud , mud
everywhere . Our desks and chairs were covered with it . The classrooms smelt disgusting . There was
so much damage that it cost my father 90 , 000 rupees to repair – equivalent to the monthly fees for
ninety students . 
It was the same story throughout Pakistan . The mighty Indus River , which flows from the Himalayas
down through KPK and Punjab to Karachi and the Arabian Sea , and of which we are so proud , had
turned into a raging torrent and burst its banks . Roads , crops and entire villages were washed away . 
Around 2 , 000 people drowned and 14 million people were affected . Many of them lost their homes
and 7 , 000 schools were destroyed . It was the worst flood in living memory . The head of the United
Nations , Ban Ki-moon , called it a ‘ slow-motion tsunami ’  . We read that more lives had been affected
and more damage had been caused by the floods than the Asian tsunami , our 2005 earthquake , 
Hurricane Katrina and the Haiti earthquake combined . 
Swat was one of the places most affected . Thirty-four of our forty-two bridges had been washed
away , cutting off much of the valley . Electric pylons had been smashed into pieces so we had no
power . Our own street was on a hill so we were a bit better protected from the overflowing river , but
we shivered at the sound of it , a growling , heavy-breathing dragon devouring everything in its path . 
The riverside hotels and restaurants where tourists used to eat trout and enjoy the views were all
destroyed . The tourist areas were the hardest hit parts of Swat . Hill station resorts like Malam Jabba , 
Madyan and Bahrain were devastated , their hotels and bazaars in ruins . 
We soon heard from our relatives that the damage in Shangla was unimaginable . The main road to
our village from Alpuri , the capital of Shangla , had been washed away , and entire villages were
submerged . Many of the houses on the hilly terraces of Karshat , Shahpur and Barkana had been taken
by mudslides . My mother ’ s family home , where Uncle Faiz Mohammad lived , was still standing but
the road it stood on had vanished . 
People had desperately tried to protect what little they owned , moving their animals to higher
ground , but the floods saturated the corn they had harvested , destroyed the orchards and drowned
many of the buffaloes . The villagers were helpless . They had no power , as all their makeshift
hydroelectric projects had been smashed to pieces . They had no clean water as the river was brown
with wreckage and debris . So strong was the force of the water that even concrete buildings had been
reduced to rubble . The school , hospital and electricity station along the main road were all razed to
the ground . 
No one could understand how this had happened . People had lived by the river in Swat for 3 , 000
years and always seen it as our lifeline , not a threat , and our valley as a haven from the outside world . 
Now we had become ‘ the valley of sorrows ’  , said my cousin Sultan Rome . First the earthquake , then
the Taliban , then the military operation and now , just as we were starting to rebuild , devastating
floods arrived to wash all our work away . People were desperately worried that the Taliban would
take advantage of the chaos and return to the valley . 
My father sent food and aid to Shangla using money collected by friends and the Swat Association
of Private Schools . Our friend Shiza and some of the activists we had met in Islamabad came to
Mingora and distributed lots of money . But just like during the earthquake , it was mainly volunteers
from Islamic groups who were the first to arrive in the more remote and isolated areas with aid . Many
said the floods were another reproof from God for the music and dancing we had enjoyed at the recent
festivals . The consolation this time , however , was that there was no radio to spread this message ! 
While all this suffering was going on , while people were losing their loved ones , their homes and
their livelihoods , our president , Asif Zardari , was on holiday at a chateau in France .  ‘ I am confused , 
Aba ,  ’ I told my father .  ‘ What ’ s stopping each and every politician from doing good things ? Why
would they not want our people to be safe , to have food and electricity ?  ’ 
After the Islamic groups the main help came from the army . Not just our army . The Americans also
sent helicopters , which made some people suspicious . One theory was that the devastation had been
created by the Americans using something called HAARP ( High Frequency Active Auroral Research
Program ) technology , which causes huge waves under the ocean , thus flooding our land . Then , under
the pretext of bringing in aid , they could legitimately enter Pakistan and spy on all our secrets . 
Even when the rains finally ceased life was still very difficult . We had no clean water and no
electricity . In August we had our first case of cholera in Mingora and soon there was a tent of patients
outside the hospital . Because we were cut off from supply routes , what little food was available was
extremely expensive . It was the peach and onion season and farmers were desperate to save their
harvests . Many of them made hazardous journeys across the churning , swollen river on boats made
from rubber tyres to try to bring their produce to market . When we found peaches for sale we were so
happy . 
There was less foreign help than there might have been at another time . The rich countries of the
West were suffering from an economic crisis , and President Zardari ’ s travels around Europe had
made them less sympathetic . Foreign governments pointed out that most of our politicians weren ’ t
paying any income tax , so it was a bit much to ask hard-pressed taxpayers in their own countries to
contribute . Foreign aid agencies were also worried about the safety of their staff after a Taliban
spokesperson demanded that the Pakistan government reject help from Christians and Jews . No one
doubted they were serious . The previous October , the World Food Programme office in Islamabad
had been bombed and five aid workers were killed . 
In Swat we began to see more signs that the Taliban had never really left . Two more schools were
blown up and three foreign aid workers from a Christian group were kidnapped as they returned to
their base in Mingora and then murdered . We received other shocking news . My father ’ s friend Dr
Mohammad Farooq , the vice chancellor of Swat University , had been killed by two gunmen who burst
into his office . Dr Farooq was an Islamic scholar and former member of the Jamaat-e-Islami party , 
and as one of the biggest voices against Talibanisation he had even issued a fatwa against suicide
attacks . 
We felt frustrated and scared once again . When we were IDPs I had thought about becoming a
politician and now I knew that was the right choice . Our country had so many crises and no real
leaders to tackle them .

Praying to Be Tall
WHEN I WAS thirteen I stopped growing . I had always looked older than I was but suddenly all my
friends were taller than me . I was one of the three shortest girls in my class of thirty . I felt
embarrassed when I was with my friends . Every night I prayed to Allah to be taller . I measured
myself on my bedroom wall with a ruler and a pencil . Every morning I would stand against it to check
if I had grown . But the pencil mark stayed stubbornly at five feet . I even promised Allah that if I could
grow just a tiny bit taller I would offer a hundred raakat nafl , extra voluntary prayers on top of the
five daily ones . 
I was speaking at a lot of events but because I was so short it wasn ’ t easy to be authoritative . 
Sometimes I could hardly see over the lectern . I did not like high-heeled shoes but I started to wear
them . 
One of the girls in my class did not return to school that year . She had been married off as soon as
she entered puberty . She was big for her age but was still only thirteen . A while later we heard that
she had two children . In class , when we were reciting hydrocarbon formulae during our chemistry
lessons , I would daydream about what it would be like to stop going to school and instead start
looking after a husband . 
We had begun to think about other things besides the Taliban , but it wasn ’ t possible to forget
completely . Our army , which already had a lot of strange side businesses , like factories making
cornflakes and fertilisers , had started producing soap operas . People across Pakistan were glued to a
series on prime-time TV called Beyond the Call of Duty , which was supposed to consist of real-life
stories of soldiers battling militants in Swat . 
Over a hundred soldiers had been killed in the military operation and 900 injured , and they wanted
to show themselves as heroes . But though their sacrifice was supposed to have restored government
control , we were still waiting for the rule of law . Most afternoons when I came home from school
there were women at our house in tears . Hundreds of men had gone missing during the military
campaign , presumably picked up by the army or ISI , but no one would say . The women could not get
information ; they didn ’ t know if their husbands and sons were dead or alive . Some of them were in
desperate situations as they had no way to support themselves . A woman can only remarry if her
husband is declared dead , not missing . 
My mother gave them tea and food but that wasn ’ t why they came . They wanted my father ’ s help . 
Because of his role as spokesman for the Swat Qaumi Jirga , he acted as a kind of liaison between the
people and the army . 
 ‘ I just want to know if my husband is dead or not ,  ’ pleaded one lady I met .  ‘ If they killed him then I
can put the children in an orphanage . But now I ’ m neither a widow nor a wife .  ’ Another lady told me
her son was missing . The women said the missing men had not collaborated with the Taliban ; maybe
they had given them a glass of water or some bread when they ’ d been ordered to do so . Yet these
innocent men were being held while the Taliban leaders went free . 
There was a teacher in our school who lived just a ten-minute walk from our house . Her brother
had been picked up by the army , put in leg irons and tortured , and then kept in a fridge until he died . 
He ’ d had nothing to do with the Taliban . He was just a simple shopkeeper . Afterwards the army
apologised to her and said they ’ d been confused by his name and picked up the wrong person . 
It wasn ’ t just poor women who came to our house . One day a rich businessman arrived from
Muscat in the Gulf . He told my father that his brother and five or six nephews had all disappeared , 
and he wanted to know if they had been killed or were being held so he knew whether to find new
husbands for their wives . One of them was a maulana and my father managed to get him freed . 
This wasn ’ t just happening in Swat . We heard there were thousands of missing all over Pakistan . 
Many people protested outside courthouses or put up posters of their missing but got nowhere . 
Meanwhile our courts were busy with another issue . In Pakistan we have something called the
Blasphemy Law , which protects the Holy Quran from desecration . Under General Zia ’ s Islamisation
campaign , the law was made much stricter so that anyone who ‘ defiles the sacred name of the Holy
Prophet ’ can be punished by death or life imprisonment . 
One day in November 2010 there was a news report about a Christian woman called Asia Bibi
who had been sentenced to death by hanging . She was a poor mother of five who picked fruit for a
living in a village in Punjab . One hot day she had fetched water for her fellow workers but some of
them refused to drink it , saying that the water was ‘ unclean ’ because she was a Christian . They
believed that as Muslims they would be defiled by drinking with her . One of them was her neighbour , 
who was angry because she said Asia Bibi ’ s goat had damaged her water trough . They had ended up
in an argument , and of course just as in our arguments at school there were different versions of who
said what . One version was that they tried to persuade Asia Bibi to convert to Islam . She replied that
Christ had died on the cross for the sins of Christians and asked what the Prophet Mohammad had
done for Muslims . One of the fruit pickers reported her to the local imam , who informed the police . 
She spent more than a year in jail before the case went to court and she was sentenced to death . 
Since Musharraf had allowed satellite television , we now had lots of channels . Suddenly we could
witness these events on television . There was outrage round the world and all the talk shows covered
the case . One of the few people who spoke out for Asia Bibi in Pakistan was the governor of Punjab , 
Salman Taseer . He himself had been a political prisoner as well as a close ally of Benazir . Later on
he became a wealthy media mogul . He went to visit Asia Bibi in jail and said that President Zardari
should pardon her . He called the Blasphemy Law a ‘ black law ’  , a phrase which was repeated by
some of our TV anchors to stir things up . Then some imams at Friday prayers in the largest mosque in
Rawalpindi condemned the governor . 
A couple of days later , on 4 January 2011 , Salman Taseer was gunned down by one of his own
bodyguards after lunch in an area of fashionable coffee bars in Islamabad . The man shot him twentysix times . He later said that he had done it for God after hearing the Friday prayers in Rawalpindi . 
We were shocked by how many people praised the killer . When he appeared in court even lawyers
showered him with rose petals . Meanwhile the imam at the late governor ’ s mosque refused to
perform his funeral prayers and the president did not attend his funeral . 
Our country was going crazy . How was it possible that we were now garlanding murderers ? 
Shortly after that my father got another death threat . He had spoken at an event to commemorate the
third anniversary of the bombing of the Haji Baba High School . At the event my father had spoken
passionately .  ‘ Fazlullah is the chief of all devils !  ’ he shouted .  ‘ Why hasn ’ t he been caught ?  ’ 
Afterwards people told him to be very careful . Then an anonymous letter came to our house
addressed to my father . It started with ‘ Asalaamu alaikum ’ – ‘ Peace be upon you ’ – but it wasn ’ t
peaceful at all . It went on ,  ‘ You are the son of a religious cleric but you are not a good Muslim . The
mujahideen will find you wherever you go .  ’ When my father received the letter he seemed worried
for a couple of weeks , but he refused to give up his activities and was soon distracted by other things .

In those days it seemed like everyone was talking about America . Where once we used to blame our
old enemy India for everything , now it was the US . Everyone complained about the drone attacks
which were happening in the FATA almost every week . We heard lots of civilians were being killed . 
Then a CIA agent called Raymond Davis shot and killed two men in Lahore who had approached his
car on a motorbike . He said they had attempted to rob him . The Americans claimed he was not CIA
but an ordinary diplomat , which made everyone very suspicious . Even we schoolchildren know that
ordinary diplomats don ’ t drive around in unmarked cars carrying Glock pistols . 
Our media claimed Davis was part of a vast secret army that the CIA had sent to Pakistan because
they didn ’ t trust our intelligence agencies . He was said to be spying on a militant group called
Lashkar-e-Taiba based in Lahore that had helped our people a lot during the earthquake and floods . 
They were thought to be behind the terrible Mumbai massacre of 2008 . The group ’ s main objective
was to liberate Kashmir ’ s Muslims from Indian rule , but they had recently also become active in
Afghanistan . Other people said Davis was really spying on our nuclear weapons . 
Raymond Davis quickly became the most famous American in Pakistan . There were protests all
over the country . People imagined our bazaars were full of Raymond Davises , gathering intelligence
to send back to the States . Then the widow of one of the men Davis had murdered took rat poison and
killed herself , despairing of receiving justice . 
It took weeks of back and forth between Washington and Islamabad , or rather army headquarters in
Rawalpindi , before the case was finally resolved . What they did was like our traditional jirgas – the
Americans paid ‘ blood money ’ amounting to $2 . 3 million and Davis was quickly spirited out of court
and out of the country . Pakistan then demanded that the CIA send home many of its contractors and
stopped approving visas . The whole affair left a lot of bad feeling , particularly because on 17 March , 
the day after Davis was released , a drone attack on a tribal council in North Waziristan killed about
forty people . The attack seemed to send the message that the CIA could do as it pleased in our
country . 
One Monday I was about to measure myself against the wall to see if I had miraculously grown in the
night when I heard loud voices next door . My father ’ s friends had arrived with news that was hard to
believe . During the night American special forces called Navy Seals had carried out a raid in
Abbottabad , one of the places we ’ d stayed as IDPs , and had found and killed Osama bin Laden . He
had been living in a large walled compound less than a mile from our military academy . We couldn ’ t
believe the army had been oblivious to bin Laden ’ s whereabouts . The newspapers said that the cadets
even did their training in the field alongside his house . The compound had twelve-foot-high walls
topped with barbed wire . Bin Laden lived on the top floor with his youngest wife , a Yemeni woman
named Amal . Two other wives and his eleven children lived below them . An American senator said
that the only thing missing from bin Laden ’ s hideaway was a ‘ neon sign ’  . 
In truth , lots of people in Pashtun areas live in walled compounds because of purdah and privacy , 
so the house wasn ’ t really unusual . What was odd was that the residents never went out and the house
had no phone or Internet connections . Their food was brought in by two brothers who also lived in the
compound with their wives . They acted as couriers for bin Laden . One of the wives was from Swat ! 
The Seals had shot bin Laden in the head and his body had been flown out by helicopter . It didn ’ t
sound as though he had put up a fight . The two brothers and one of bin Laden ’ s grown-up sons had
also been killed , but bin Laden ’ s wives and other children had been tied up and left behind and were
then taken into Pakistani custody . The Americans dumped bin Laden ’ s body at sea . President Obama
was very happy , and on TV we watched big celebrations take place outside the White House . 
At first we assumed our government had known and been involved in the American operation . But
we soon found out that the Americans had gone it alone . This didn ’ t sit well with our people . We
were supposed to be allies and we had lost more soldiers in their War on Terror than they had . They
had entered the country at night , flying low and using special quiet helicopters , and had blocked our
radar with electronic interference . They had only announced their mission to the army chief of staff , 
General Ashfaq Kayani , and President Zardari after the event . Most of the army leadership learned
about it on TV . 
The Americans said they had no choice but to do it like that because no one really knew which side
the ISI was on and someone might have tipped off bin Laden before they reached him . The director of
the CIA said Pakistan was ‘ either involved or incompetent . Neither place is a good place to be .  ’ 
My father said it was a shameful day .  ‘ How could a notorious terrorist be hiding in Pakistan and
remain undetected for so many years ?  ’ he asked . Others were asking the same thing . 
You could see why anyone would think our intelligence service must have known bin Laden ’ s
location . ISI is a huge organisation with agents everywhere . How could he have lived so close to the
capital – just sixty miles away ? And for so long ! Maybe the best place to hide is in plain sight , but he
had been living in that house since the 2005 earthquake . Two of his children were even born in the
Abbottabad hospital . And he ’ d been in Pakistan for more than nine years . Before Abbottabad he ’ d
been in Haripur and before that hidden away in our own Swat Valley , where he met Khalid Sheikh
Mohammad , the mastermind of 9 / 11 . 
The way bin Laden was found was like something out of the spy movies my brother Khushal likes . 
To avoid detection he used human couriers rather than phone calls or emails . But the Americans had
discovered one of his couriers , tracked the number plate of his car and followed it from Peshawar to
Abbottabad . After that they monitored the house with a kind of giant drone that has X-ray vision , 
which spotted a very tall bearded man pacing round the compound . They called him the Pacer . 
People were intrigued by the new details that came every day , but they seemed angrier at the
American incursion than at the fact that the world ’ s biggest terrorist had been living on our soil . Some
newspapers ran stories saying that the Americans had actually killed bin Laden years before this and
kept his body in a freezer . The story was that they had then planted the body in Abbottabad and faked
the raid to embarrass Pakistan . 
We started to receive text messages asking us to rally in the streets and show our support of the
army .  ‘ We were there for you in 1948 , 1965 and 1971 ,  ’ said one message , referring to our three wars
with India .  ‘ Be with us now when we have been stabbed in the back .  ’ But there were also text
messages which ridiculed the army . People asked how we could be spending $6 billion a year on the
military ( seven times more than we were spending on education )  , if four American helicopters could
just sneak in under our radar ? And if they could do it , what was to stop the Indians next door ?  ‘ Please
don ’ t honk , the army is sleeping ,  ’ said one text , and ‘ Second-hand Pakistani radar for sale .  .  . can ’ t
detect US helicopters but gets cable TV just fine ,  ’ said another . 
General Kayani and General Ahmad Shuja Pasha , the head of ISI , were called to testify in
parliament , something that had never happened . Our country had been humiliated and we wanted to
know why . 
We also learned that American politicians were furious that bin Laden had been living under our
noses when all along they had imagined he was hiding in a cave . They complained that they had given
us $20 billion over an eight-year period to cooperate and it was questionable which side we were on . 
Sometimes it felt as though it was all about the money . Most of it had gone to the army ; ordinary
people received nothing .  
* 
A few months after that , in October 2011 my father told me he had received an email informing him I
was one of five nominees for the international peace prize of KidsRights , a children ’ s advocacy
group based in Amsterdam . My name had been put forward by Archbishop Desmond Tutu from South
Africa . He was a great hero of my father for his fight against apartheid . My father was disappointed
when I didn ’ t win but I pointed out to him that all I had done was speak out ; we didn ’ t have an
organisation doing practical things like the award winners had . 
Shortly after that I was invited by the chief minister of Punjab , Shahbaz Sharif , to speak in Lahore
at an education gala . He was building a network of new schools he calls Daanish Schools and giving
free laptops to students , even if they did have his picture on their screens when you switched them on . 
To motivate students in all provinces he was giving cash awards to girls and boys who scored well in
their exams . I was presented with a cheque for half a million rupees , about $4 , 500 , for my campaign
for girls ’ rights . 
I wore pink to the gala and for the first time talked publicly about how we had defied the Taliban
edict and carried on going to school secretly .  ‘ I know the importance of education because my pens
and books were taken from me by force ,  ’ I said .  ‘ But the girls of Swat are not afraid of anyone . We
have continued with our education .  ’ 
Then I was in class one day when my classmates said ,  ‘ You have won a big prize and half a
million rupees !  ’ My father told me the government had awarded me Pakistan ’ s first ever National
Peace Prize . I couldn ’ t believe it . So many journalists thronged to the school that day that it turned
into a news studio . 
The ceremony was on 20 December 2011 at the prime minister ’ s official residence , one of the big
white mansions on the hill at the end of Constitution Avenue which I had seen on my trip to
Islamabad . By then I was used to meeting politicians . I was not nervous though my father tried to
intimidate me by saying Prime Minister Gilani came from a family of saints . After the PM presented
me with the award and cheque , I presented him with a long list of demands . I told him that we wanted
our schools rebuilt and a girls ’ university in Swat . I knew he would not take my demands seriously so
I didn ’ t push very hard . I thought , One day I will be a politician and do these things myself . 
It was decided that the prize should be awarded annually to children under eighteen years old and
be named the Malala Prize in my honour . I noticed my father was not very happy with this . Like most
Pashtuns he is a bit superstitious . In Pakistan we don ’ t have a culture of honouring people while they
are alive , only the dead , so he thought it was a bad omen . 
I know my mother didn ’ t like the awards because she feared I would become a target as I was
becoming more well known . She herself would never appear in public . She refused even to be
photographed . She is a very traditional woman and this is our centuries-old culture . Were she to
break that tradition , men and women would talk against her , particularly those in our own family . She
never said she regretted the work my father and I had undertaken , but when I won prizes , she said ,  ‘ I
don ’ t want awards , I want my daughter . I wouldn ’ t exchange a single eyelash of my daughter for the
whole world .  ’ 
My father argued that all he had ever wanted was to create a school in which children could learn . 
We had been left with no choice but to get involved in politics and campaign for education .  ‘ My only
ambition ,  ’ he said ,  ‘ is to educate my children and my nation as much as I am able . But when half of
your leaders tell lies and the other half is negotiating with the Taliban , there is nowhere to go . One
has to speak out .  ’ 
When I returned home I was greeted with the news that there was a group of journalists who
wanted to interview me at school and that I should wear a nice outfit . First I thought of wearing a very
beautiful dress , but then I decided to wear something more modest for the interview as I wanted
people to focus on my message and not my clothes . When I arrived at school I saw all my friends had
dressed up .  ‘ Surprise !  ’ they shouted when I walked in . They had collected money and organised a
party for me with a big white cake on which was written SUCCESS FOREVER in chocolate icing . It was
wonderful that my friends wanted to share in my success . I knew that any of the girls in my class could
have achieved what I had achieved if they had had their parents ’ support . 
 ‘ Now you can get back to school work ,  ’ said Madam Maryam as we finished off the cake .  ‘ Exams
in March !  ’ 
But the year ended on a sad note . Five days after I got the award , Aunt Babo , my mother ’ s eldest
sister , died suddenly . She wasn ’ t even fifty years old . She was diabetic and had seen a TV advert for
a doctor in Lahore with some miracle treatment and persuaded my uncle to take her there . We don ’ t
know what the doctor injected her with but she went into shock and died . My father said the doctor
was a charlatan and this was why we needed to keep struggling against ignorance . 
I had amassed a lot of money by the end of that year – half a million rupees each from the prime
minister , the chief minister of Punjab , the chief minister of our state Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the
Sindh government . Major General Ghulam Qamar , the local army commander , also gave our school
100 , 000 rupees to build a science laboratory and a library . But my fight wasn ’ t over . I was reminded
of our history lessons , in which we learned about the loot or bounty an army enjoys when a battle is
won . I began to see the awards and recognition just like that . They were little jewels without much
meaning . I needed to concentrate on winning the war . 
My father used some of the money to buy me a new bed and cabinet and pay for tooth implants for
my mother and a piece of land in Shangla . We decided to spend the rest of the money on people who
needed help . I wanted to start an education foundation . This had been on my mind ever since I ’ d seen
the children working on the rubbish mountain . I still could not shake the image of the black rats I had
seen there , and the girl with matted hair who had been sorting rubbish . We held a conference of
twenty-one girls and made our priority education for every girl in Swat with a particular focus on
street children and those in child labour . 
As we crossed the Malakand Pass I saw a young girl selling oranges . She was scratching marks on
a piece of paper with a pencil to account for the oranges she had sold as she could not read or write . I
took a photo of her and vowed I would do everything in my power to help educate girls just like her . 
This was the war I was going to fight .

The Woman and the Sea
AUNT NAJMA WAS in tears . She had never seen the sea before . My family and I sat on the rocks , 
gazing across the water , breathing in the salt tang of the Arabian Sea . It was such a big expanse , 
surely no one could know where it ended . At that moment I was very happy .  ‘ One day I want to cross
this sea ,  ’ I said . 
 ‘ What is she saying ?  ’ asked my aunt as if I were talking about something impossible . I was still
trying to get my head round the fact that she had been living in the seaside city of Karachi for thirty
years and yet had never actually laid eyes on the ocean . Her husband would not take her to the beach , 
and even if she had somehow slipped out of the house , she would not have been able to follow the
signs to the sea because she could not read . 
I sat on the rocks and thought about the fact that across the water were lands where women were
free . In Pakistan we had had a woman prime minister and in Islamabad I had met those impressive
working women , yet the fact was that we were a country where almost all the women depend entirely
on men . My headmistress Maryam was a strong , educated woman but in our society she could not live
on her own and come to work . She had to be living with a husband , brother or parents . 
In Pakistan when women say they want independence , people think this means we don ’ t want to
obey our fathers , brothers or husbands . But it does not mean that . It means we want to make decisions
for ourselves . We want to be free to go to school or to go to work . Nowhere is it written in the Quran
that a woman should be dependent on a man . The word has not come down from the heavens to tell us
that every woman should listen to a man . 
 ‘ You are a million miles away , Jani ,  ’ said my father interrupting my thoughts .  ‘ What are you
dreaming about ?  ’ 
 ‘ Just about crossing oceans , Aba ’  , I replied . 
 ‘ Forget all that !  ’ shouted my brother Atal .  ‘ We ’ re at the beach and I want to go for a camel ride !  ’ 
It was January 2012 and we were in Karachi as guests of Geo TV after the Sindh government
announced they were renaming a girls ’ secondary school on Mission Road in my honour . My brother
Khushal was now at school in Abbottabad , so it was just me , my parents and Atal . We flew to
Karachi , and it was the first time any of us had ever been on a plane . The journey was just two hours , 
which I found incredible . It would have taken us at least two days by bus . On the plane we noticed
that some people could not find their seats because they could not read letters and numbers . I had a
window seat and could see the deserts and mountains of our land below me . As we headed south the
land became more parched . I was already missing the green of Swat . I could see why , when our
people go to Karachi to work , they always want to be buried in the cool of our valley . 
Driving from the airport to the hostel , I was amazed by the number of people and houses and cars . 
Karachi is one of the biggest cities on earth . It was strange to think it was just a port of 300 , 000
people when Pakistan was created . Jinnah lived there and made it our first capital , and it was soon
flooded by millions of Muslim refugees from India known as mohajirs , which means ‘ immigrants ’  , 
who spoke Urdu . Today it has around twenty million people . It ’ s actually the largest Pashtun city in
the world , even though it ’ s far from our lands ; between five and seven million Pashtuns have gone
there to work . 
Unfortunately , Karachi has also become a very violent city and there is always fighting between the
mohajirs and Pashtuns . The mohajir areas we saw all seemed very organised and neat whereas the
Pashtun areas were dirty and chaotic . The mohajirs almost all support a party called the MQM led by
Altaf Hussain , who lives in exile in London and communicates with his people by Skype . The MQM
is a very organised movement , and the mohajir community sticks together . By contrast we Pashtuns
are very divided , some following Imran Khan because he is Pashtun , a khan and a great cricketer , 
some Maulana Fazlur Rehman because his party JUI is Islamic , some the secular ANP because it ’ s a
Pashtun nationalist party and some the PPP of Benazir Bhutto or the PML ( N ) of Nawaz Sharif . 
We went to the Sindh assembly , where I was applauded by all the members . Then we went to visit
some schools including the one that was being named after me . I made a speech about the importance
of education and also talked about Benazir Bhutto as this was her city .  ‘ We must all work together for
the rights of girls ,  ’ I said . The children sang for me and I was presented with a painting of me looking
up at the sky . It was both odd and wonderful to see my name on a school just like my namesake
Malalai of Maiwind , after whom so many schools in Afghanistan are named . In the next school
holidays my father and I planned to go and talk to parents and children in the distant hilly areas of
Swat about the importance of learning to read and write .  ‘ We will be like preachers of education ,  ’ I
said . 
Later that day we visited my aunt and uncle . They lived in a very small house and so at last my
father understood why they had refused to take him in when he was a student . On the way we passed
through Aashiqan e-Rasool square and were shocked to see a picture of the murderer of Governor
Salman Taseer decorated with garlands of rose petals as though he were a saint . My father was angry . 
 ‘ In a city of twenty million people is there not one person who will take this down ?  ’ 
There was one important place we had to include in our visit to Karachi besides our outings to the
sea or the huge bazaars , where my mother bought lots of clothes . We needed to visit the mausoleum of
our founder and great leader Mohammad Ali Jinnah . This is a very peaceful building of white marble
and somehow seemed separate from the hustle and bustle of the city . It felt sacred to us . Benazir was
on her way there to make her first speech on her return to Pakistan when her bus was blown up . 
The guard explained that the tomb in the main room under a giant chandelier from China did not
contain Jinnah ’ s body . The real tomb is on the floor below , where he lies alongside his sister Fatima , 
who died much later . Next to it is the tomb of our first prime minister , Liaquat Ali Khan , who was
assassinated . 
Afterwards we went into the small museum at the back , which had displays of the special white
bow ties Jinnah used to order from Paris , his three-piece suits tailored in London , his golf clubs and a
special travelling box with drawers for twelve pairs of shoes including his favourite two-tone
brogues . The walls were covered with photographs . In the ones from the early days of Pakistan you
could easily see from his thin sunken face that Jinnah was dying . His skin looked paper-thin . But at the
time it was kept a secret . Jinnah smoked fifty cigarettes a day . His body was riddled with TB and lung
cancer when Lord Mountbatten , the last British viceroy of India , agreed that India would be divided
at independence . Afterwards he said that had he known Jinnah was dying he would have delayed and
there would have been no Pakistan . As it was , Jinnah died in September 1948 just over a year later . 
Then , a little more than three years after that , our first prime minister was killed . Right from the start
we were an unlucky country . 
Some of Jinnah ’ s most famous speeches were displayed . There was the one about people of all
religions being free to worship in the new Pakistan . And another where he had spoken about the
important role of women . I wanted to see pictures of the women in his life . But his wife died young
and was a Parsee , and their only daughter Dina stayed in India and married a Parsee , which didn ’ t sit
very well in the new Muslim homeland . Now she lives in New York . So most of the pictures I found
were of his sister Fatima . 
It was hard to visit that place and read those speeches without thinking that Jinnah would be very
disappointed in Pakistan . He would probably say that this was not the country he had wanted . He
wished us to be independent , to be tolerant , to be kind to each other . He wanted everyone to be free
whatever their beliefs . 
 ‘ Would it have been better if we had not become independent but stayed part of India ?  ’ I asked my
father . It seemed to me that before Pakistan there was endless fighting between Hindus and Muslims . 
Then even when we got our own country there was still fighting , but this time it was between
mohajirs and Pashtuns and between Sunnis and Shias . Instead of celebrating each other , our four
provinces struggle to get along . Sindhis often talk of separation and in Baluchistan there is an ongoing
war which gets talked about very little because it is so remote . Did all this fighting mean we needed
to divide our country yet again ? 
When we left the museum some young men with flags were protesting outside . They told us they
were Seraiki speakers from southern Punjab and wanted their own province . 
There seemed to be so many things about which people were fighting . If Christians , Hindus or Jews
are really our enemies , as so many say , why are we Muslims fighting with each other ? Our people
have become misguided . They think their greatest concern is defending Islam and are being led astray
by those like the Taliban who deliberately misinterpret the Quran . We should focus on practical
issues . We have so many people in our country who are illiterate . And many women have no
education at all . We live in a place where schools are blown up . We have no reliable electricity
supply . Not a single day passes without the killing of at least one Pakistani . 
One day a lady called Shehla Anjum turned up at our hostel . She was a Pakistani journalist living in
Alaska and wanted to meet me after she had seen the documentary about us on the New York Times
website . She chatted with me for a while then with my father . I noticed she had tears in her eyes . Then
she asked my father ,  ‘ Did you know , Ziauddin , that the Taliban have threatened this innocent girl ?  ’ 
We didn ’ t know what she was talking about so she went on the Internet and showed us that the
Taliban had that day issued threats against two women – Shad Begum , an activist in Dir , and me , 
Malala .  ‘ These two are spreading secularism and should be killed ,  ’ it said . I didn ’ t take it seriously
as there are so many things on the Internet and I thought we would have heard from elsewhere if it
were real . 
That evening my father received a call from the family who had been sharing our home for the last
eighteen months . Their previous home had a mud roof which leaked in the rain and we had two spare
rooms so they stayed with us for a nominal rent and their children went to our school for free . They
had three children , and we liked them living with us as we all played cops and robbers on the roof . 
They told my father that the police had turned up at the house and demanded to know whether we had
received any threats . When my father heard this , he called the deputy superintendent , who asked him
the same thing . My father asked ,  ‘ Why , have you any information ?  ’ The officer asked to see my father
when we were back in Swat . 
After that my father was restless and could not enjoy Karachi . I could see my mother and father
were both very upset . I knew my mother was still mourning my aunt and they had been feeling uneasy
about me receiving so many awards , but it seemed to be about more than that .  ‘ Why are you like this ?  ’ 
I asked .  ‘ You ’ re worried about something but you ’ re not telling us .  ’ 
Then they told me about the call from home and that they were taking the threats seriously . I don ’ t
know why , but hearing I was being targeted did not worry me . It seemed to me that everyone knows
they will die one day . My feeling was that nobody can stop death ; it doesn ’ t matter if it comes from a
talib or cancer . So I should do whatever I want to do . 
 ‘ Maybe we should stop our campaigning , Jani , and go into hibernation for a time ,  ’ said my father . 
 ‘ How can we do that ?  ’ I replied .  ‘ You were the one who said if we believe in something greater
than our lives , then our voices will only multiply even if we are dead . We can ’ t disown our
campaign !  ’ 
People were asking me to speak at events . How could I refuse , saying there was a security
problem ? We couldn ’ t do that , especially not as proud Pashtuns . My father always says that heroism
is in the Pashtun DNA . 
Still , it was with a heavy heart that we returned to Swat . When my father went to the police they
showed him a file on me . They told him that my national and international profile meant I had
attracted attention and death threats from the Taliban and that I needed protection . They offered us
guards but my father was reluctant . Many elders in Swat had been killed despite having bodyguards
and the Punjab governor had been killed by his own bodyguard . He also thought armed guards would
alarm the parents of the students at school , and he didn ’ t want to put others at risk . When he had had
threats before he always said ,  ‘ Let them kill me but I ’ ll be killed alone .  ’ 
He suggested sending me to boarding school in Abbottabad like Khushal , but I didn ’ t want to go . 
He also met the local army colonel , who said being in college in Abbottabad would not really be any
safer and that as long as I kept a low profile we would be OK in Swat . So when the government of
KPK offered to make me a peace ambassador , my father said it was better to refuse . 
At home I started bolting the main gate of our house at night .  ‘ She smells the threat ,  ’ my mother told
my father . He was very unhappy . He kept telling me to draw the curtains in my room at night , but I
would not . 
 ‘ Aba , this is a very strange situation ,  ’ I told him .  ‘ When there was Talibanisation we were safe ; 
now there are no Taliban we are unsafe .  ’ 
 ‘ Yes , Malala ,  ’ he replied .  ‘ Now the Talibanisation is especially for us , for those like you and me
who continue to speak out . The rest of Swat is OK . The rickshaw drivers , the shopkeepers are all
safe . This is Talibanisation for particular people , and we are among them .  ’ 
There was another downside to receiving those awards – I was missing a lot of school . After the
exams in March the cup that went into my new cabinet was for second place .

A Private Talibanisation
 ‘ LET ’ S PRETEND IT ’ S a Twilight movie and that we ’ re vampires in the forest ,  ’ I said to Moniba . We
were on a school trip to Marghazar , a beautiful green valley where the air is cool , and there is a tall
mountain and a crystal-clear river where we were planning to have a picnic . Nearby was the White
Palace Hotel , which used to be the wali ’ s summer residence . 
It was April 2012 , the month after our exams so we were all feeling relaxed . We were a group of
about seventy girls . Our teachers and my parents were there too . My father had hired three Flying
Coaches but we could not all fit in , so five of us – me , Moniba and three other girls – were in the
dyna , the school van . It wasn ’ t very comfortable , especially because we also had giant pots of
chicken and rice on the floor for the picnic , but it was only half an hour ’ s drive . We had fun , singing
songs on the way there . Moniba was looking very beautiful , her skin porcelain-pale .  ‘ What skin
cream are you using ?  ’ I asked her . 
 ‘ The same one you ’ re using ,  ’ she replied . 
I knew that could not be true .  ‘ No . Look at my dark skin and look at yours !  ’ 
We visited the White Palace and saw where the Queen had slept and the gardens of beautiful
flowers . Sadly we could not see the wali ’ s room as it had been damaged by the floods . 
We ran around for a while in the green forest , then took some photographs and waded into the river
and splashed each other with water . The drops sparkled in the sun . There was a waterfall down the
cliff and for a while we sat on the rocks and listened to it . Then Moniba started splashing me again . 
 ‘ Don ’ t ! I don ’ t want to get my clothes wet !  ’ I pleaded . I walked off with two other girls she didn ’ t
like . The other girls stirred things up , what we call ‘ putting masala on the situation ’  . It was a recipe
for another argument between Moniba and me . That put me in a bad mood , but I cheered up when we
got to the top of the cliff , where lunch was being prepared . Usman Bhai Jan , our driver , made us laugh
as usual . Madam Maryam had brought her baby boy and Hannah , her two-year-old , who looked like a
little doll but was full of mischief . 
Lunch was a disaster . When the school assistants put the pans on the fire to heat up the chicken
curry , they panicked that there was not enough food for so many girls and added water from the
stream . We said it was ‘ the worst lunch ever ’  . It was so watery that one girl said ,  ‘ The sky could be
seen in the soupy curry .  ’ 
Like on all our trips my father got us all to stand on a rock and talk about our impressions of the day
before we left . This time all anyone talked about was how bad the food was . My father was
embarrassed and for once , short of words . 
The next morning a school worker came with milk , bread and eggs to our house for our breakfast . My
father always answered the door as women must stay inside . The man told him the shopkeeper had
given him a photocopied letter . 
When my father read it , he went pale .  ‘ By God , this is terrible propaganda against our school !  ’ he
told my mother . He read it out . 
Dear Muslim brothers
There is a school , the Khushal School , which is run by an NGO [ NGOs have a very bad reputation among religious people in our
country so this was a way to invite people ’ s wrath ] and is a centre of vulgarity and obscenity . It is a Hadith of the Holy Prophet
that if you see something bad or evil you should stop it with your own hand . If you are unable to do that then you should tell others
about it , and if you can ’ t do that you should think about how bad it is in your heart . I have no personal quarrel with the principal but
I am telling you what Islam says . This school is a centre of vulgarity and obscenity and they take girls for picnics to different
resorts . If you don ’ t stop it you will have to answer to God on Doomsday . Go and ask the manager of the White Palace Hotel and
he will tell you what these girls did .  .  . 
He put down the piece of paper .  ‘ It has no signature . Anonymous .  ’ 
We sat stunned . 
 ‘ They know no one will ask the manager ,  ’ said my father .  ‘ People will just imagine something
terrible went on .  ’ 
 ‘ We know what happened there . The girls did nothing bad ,  ’ my mother reassured him . 
My father called my cousin Khanjee to find out how widely the letters had been distributed . He
called back with bad news – they had been left everywhere , though most shopkeepers had ignored
them and thrown them away . There were also giant posters pasted on the front of the mosque with the
same accusations . 
At school my classmates were terrified .  ‘ Sir , they are saying very bad things about our school ,  ’ 
they said to my father .  ‘ What will our parents say ?  ’ 
My father gathered all the girls into the courtyard .  ‘ Why are you afraid ?  ’ he asked .  ‘ Did you do
anything against Islam ? Did you do anything immoral ? No . You just splashed water and took pictures , 
so don ’ t be scared . This is the propaganda of the followers of Mullah Fazlullah . Down with them ! 
You have the right to enjoy greenery and waterfalls and landscape just as boys do .  ’ 
My father spoke like a lion , but I could see in his heart he was worried and scared . Only one
person came and withdrew his sister from the school , but we knew that was not the end of it . Shortly
after that we were told a man who had completed a peace walk from Dera Ismail Khan was coming
through Mingora and we wanted to welcome him . I was on the way to meet him with my parents when
we were approached by a short man who was frantically talking on two different phones .  ‘ Don ’ t go
that way ,  ’ he urged .  ‘ There is a suicide bomber over there !  ’ We ’ d promised to meet the peace
walker , so we went by a different route , placed a garland round his neck , then left quickly for home . 
All through that spring and summer odd things kept happening . Strangers came to the house asking
questions about my family . My father said they were from the intelligence services . The visits became
more frequent after my father and the Swat Qaumi Jirga held a meeting in our school to protest against
army plans for the people of Mingora and our community defence committees to conduct night
patrols .  ’ The army say there is peace ,  ’ said my father .  ‘ So why do we need flag marches and night
patrols ?  ’ 
Then our school hosted a painting competition for the children of Mingora sponsored by my
father ’ s friend who ran an NGO for women ’ s rights . The pictures were supposed to show the equality
of the sexes or highlight discrimination against women . That morning two men from the intelligence
services came to our school to see my father .  ‘ What is going on in your school ?  ’ they demanded . 
 ‘ This is a school ,  ’ he replied .  ‘ There ’ s a painting competition just as we have debating
competitions , cookery competitions and essay contests .  ’ The men got very angry and so did my father . 
 ‘ Everyone knows me and what I do !  ’ he said .  ‘ Why don ’ t you do your real work and find Fazlullah
and those whose hands are red with the blood of Swat ?  ’ 
That Ramadan a friend of my father ’ s in Karachi called Wakeel Khan sent clothes for the poor , 
which he wanted us to distribute . We went to a big hall to hand them out . Before we had even started , 
intelligence agents came and asked ,  ‘ What are you doing ? Who brought these outfits ?  ’ 
On 12 July I turned fourteen , which in Islam means you are an adult . With my birthday came the news
that the Taliban had killed the owner of the Swat Continental Hotel , who was on a peace committee . 
He was on his way from home to his hotel in Mingora Bazaar when they ambushed him in a field . 
Once again people started worrying that the Taliban were creeping back . But whereas in 2008–9
there were many threats to all sorts of people , this time the threats were specific to those who spoke
against militants or the high-handed behaviour of the army . 
 ‘ The Taliban is not an organised force like we imagine ,  ’ said my father ’ s friend Hidayatullah when
they discussed it .  ‘ It ’ s a mentality , and this mentality is everywhere in Pakistan . Someone who is
against America , against the Pakistan establishment , against English law , he has been infected by the
Taliban .  ’ 
It was late in the evening of 3 August when my father received an alarming phone call from a Geo
TV correspondent called Mehboob . He was the nephew of my father ’ s friend Zahid Khan , the hotel
owner who had been attacked in 2009 . People used to say both Zahid Khan and my father were on the
Taliban radar and both would be killed ; the only thing they didn ’ t know was which would be killed
first . Mehboob told us that his uncle had been on his way to isha prayers , the last prayers of the day , 
at the mosque on the street near his house when he was shot in the face . 
When he heard the news my father said the earth fell away from his feet .  ‘ It was as if I had been
shot ,  ’ he said .  ‘ I was sure it was my turn next .  ’ 
We pleaded with my father not to go to the hospital as it was very late and the people who had
attacked Zahid Khan might be waiting for him . But he said not to go would be cowardly . He was
offered an escort by some fellow political activists but he thought that it would be too late to go if he
waited for them . So he called my cousin to take him . My mother began to pray . 
When he got to the hospital only one other member of the jirga committee was there . Zahid Khan
was bleeding so much it was as if his white beard was bathed in red . But he had been lucky . A man
had fired at him three times from close range with a pistol , but Zahid Khan had managed to grab his
hand so only the first bullet struck . Strangely it went through his neck and out through his nose . Later
he said he remembered a small clean-shaven man just standing there smiling , not even wearing a
mask . Then darkness overcame him as if he had fallen into a black hole . The irony was that Zahid
Khan had only recently started to walk to the mosque again because he thought it was safe . 
After praying for his friend , my father talked to the media .  ‘ We don ’ t understand why he ’ s been
attacked when they claim there ’ s peace ,  ’ he said .  ‘ It ’ s a big question for the army and administration .  ’ 
People warned my father to leave the hospital .  ‘ Ziauddin , it ’ s midnight and you ’ re here ! Don ’ t be
stupid !  ’ they said .  ‘ You are as vulnerable and as wanted a target as he is . Don ’ t take any more risks !  ’ 
Finally Zahid Khan was transferred to Peshawar to be operated on and my father came home . I had
not gone to sleep because I was so worried . After that I double-checked all the locks every night . 
At home our phone did not stop ringing with people calling to warn my father he could be the next
target . Hidayatullah was one of the first to call .  ‘ For God ’ s sake be careful ,  ’ he warned .  ‘ It could
have been you . They are shooting jirga members one by one . You are the spokesman – how can they
possibly let you live ?  ’ 
My father was convinced the Taliban would hunt him down and kill him , but he again refused
security from the police .  ‘ If you go around with a lot of security the Taliban will use Kalashnikovs or
suicide bombers and more people will be killed ,  ’ he said .  ‘ At least I ’ ll be killed alone .  ’ Nor would
he leave Swat .  ‘ Where can I go ?  ’ he asked my mother .  ‘ I cannot leave the area . I am president of the
Global Peace Council , the spokesperson of the council of elders , the president of the Swat
Association of Private Schools , director of my school and head of my family .  ’ 
His only precaution was to change his routine . One day he would go to the primary school first , 
another day to the girls ’ school , the next day to the boys ’ school . I noticed wherever he went he would
look up and down the street four or five times . 
Despite the risks , my father and his friends continued to be very active , holding protests and press
conferences .  ‘ Why was Zahid Khan attacked if there ’ s peace ? Who attacked him ?  ’ they demanded . 
 ‘ Since we ’ ve come back from being IDPs we haven ’ t seen any attacks on army and police . The only
targets now are peace-builders and civilians .  ’ 
The local army commander was not happy .  ‘ I tell you there are no terrorists in Mingora ,  ’ he
insisted .  ‘ Our reports say so .  ’ He claimed that Zahid Khan had been shot because of a dispute over
property . 
Zahid Khan was in hospital for twelve days then at home recuperating for a month after having
plastic surgery to repair his nose . But he refused to be silent . If anything he became more outspoken , 
particularly against the intelligence agencies , as he was convinced they were behind the Taliban . He
wrote opinion pieces in newspapers saying that the conflict in Swat had been manufactured .  ‘ I know
who targeted me . What we need to know is who imposed these militants on us ,  ’ he wrote . He
demanded that the chief justice set up a judicial commission to investigate who had brought the
Taliban into our valley . 
He drew a sketch of his attacker and said the man should be stopped before shooting anyone else . 
But the police did nothing to find him . 
After the threats against me my mother didn ’ t like me walking anywhere and insisted I get a rickshaw
to school and take the bus home even though it was only a five-minute walk . The bus dropped me at
the steps leading up to our street . A group of boys from our neighbourhood used to hang round there . 
Sometimes there was a boy called Haroon with them , who was a year older than me and used to live
on our street . We had played together as children and later he told me he was in love with me . But
then a pretty cousin came to stay with our neighbour Safina and he fell in love with her instead . When
she said she wasn ’ t interested he turned his attention back to me . After that they moved to another
street and we moved into their house . Then Haroon went away to army cadet college . 
But he came back for the holidays , and one day when I returned home from school he was hanging
around on the street . He followed me to the house and put a note inside our gate where I would see it . 
I told a small girl to fetch it for me . He had written ,  ‘ Now you have become very popular , I still love
you and know you love me . This is my number , call me .  ’ 
I gave the note to my father and he was angry . He called Haroon and told him he would tell his
father . That was the last time I saw him . After that the boys stopped coming to our street , but one of
the small boys who played with Atal would call out suggestively ,  ‘ How is Haroon ?  ’ whenever I
passed by . I got so fed up with it that one day I told Atal to bring the boy inside . I shouted at him so
angrily that he stopped . 
I told Moniba what had happened once we were friends again . She was always very careful about
interactions with boys because her brothers watched everything .  ‘ Sometimes I think it ’ s easier to be a
Twilight vampire than a girl in Swat ,  ’ I sighed . But really I wished that being hassled by a boy was
my biggest problem .

Who is Malala ? 
ONE MORNING IN late summer when my father was getting ready to go to school he noticed that the
painting of me looking at the sky which we had been given by the school in Karachi had shifted in the
night . He loved that painting and had hung it over his bed . Seeing it crooked disturbed him .  ‘ Please
put it straight ,  ’ he asked my mother in an unusually sharp tone . 
That same week our maths teacher Miss Shazia arrived at school in a hysterical state . She told my
father that she ’ d had a nightmare in which I came to school with my leg badly burned and she had
tried to protect it . She begged him to give some cooked rice to the poor , as we believe that if you give
rice , even ants and birds will eat the bits that drop to the floor and will pray for us . My father gave
money instead and she was distraught , saying that wasn ’ t the same . 
We laughed at Miss Shazia ’ s premonition , but then I started having bad dreams too . I didn ’ t say
anything to my parents but whenever I went out I was afraid that Taliban with guns would leap out at
me or throw acid in my face , as they had done to women in Afghanistan . I was particularly scared of
the steps leading up to our street where the boys used to hang out . Sometimes I thought I heard
footsteps behind me or imagined figures slipping into the shadows . 
Unlike my father , I took precautions . At night I would wait until everyone was asleep – my mother , 
my father , my brothers , the other family in our house and any guests we had from our village – then I ’ d
check every single door and window . I ’ d go outside and make sure the front gate was locked . Then I
would check all the rooms , one by one . My room was at the front with lots of windows and I kept the
curtains open . I wanted to be able to see everything , though my father told me not to .  ‘ If they were
going to kill me they would have done it in 2009 ,  ’ I said . But I worried someone would put a ladder
against the house , climb over the wall and break in through a window . 
Then I ’ d pray . At night I used to pray a lot . The Taliban think we are not Muslims but we are . We
believe in God more than they do and we trust him to protect us . I used to say the Ayat al-Kursi , the
Verse of the Throne from the second surah of the Quran , the Chapter of the Cow . This is a very
special verse and we believe that if you say it three times at night your home will be safe from
shayatin or devils . When you say it five times your street will be safe , and seven times will protect
the whole area . So I ’ d say it seven times or even more . Then I ’ d pray to God ,  ‘ Bless us . First our
father and family , then our street , then our whole mohalla , then all Swat .  ’ Then I ’ d say ,  ‘ No , all
Muslims .  ’ Then ,  ‘ No , not just Muslims ; bless all human beings .  ’ 
The time of year I prayed most was during exams . It was the one time when my friends and I did all
five prayers a day like my mother was always trying to get me to do . I found it particularly hard in the
afternoon , when I didn ’ t want to be dragged away from the TV . At exam time I prayed to Allah for
high marks though our teachers used to warn us ,  ‘ God won ’ t give you marks if you don ’ t work hard . 
God showers us with his blessings but he is honest as well .  ’ 
So I studied hard too . Usually I liked exams as a chance to show what I could do . But when they
came round in October 2012 I felt under pressure . I did not want to come second to Malka-e-Noor
again as I had in March . Then she had beaten me by not just one or two marks , the usual difference
between us , but by five marks ! I had been taking extra lessons with Sir Amjad who ran the boys ’ 
school . The night before the exams began I stayed up studying until three o ’ clock in the morning and
reread an entire textbook . 
The first paper , on Monday , 8 October , was physics . I love physics because it is about truth , a
world determined by principles and laws – no messing around or twisting things like in politics , 
particularly those in my country . As we waited for the signal to start the exam , I recited holy verses to
myself . I completed the paper but I knew I ’ d made a mistake filling in the blanks . I was so cross with
myself I almost cried . It was just one question worth only one mark , but it made me feel that
something devastating was going to happen . 
When I got home that afternoon I was sleepy , but the next day was Pakistan Studies , a difficult
paper for me . I was worried about losing even more marks so I made myself coffee with milk to drive
away the devils of sleep . When my mother came she tried it and liked it and drank the rest . I could not
tell her ,  ‘ Bhabi , please stop it , that ’ s my coffee .  ’ But there was no more coffee left in the cupboard . 
Once again I stayed up late , memorising the textbook about the history of our independence . 
In the morning my parents came to my room as usual and woke me up . I don ’ t remember a single
school day on which I woke up early by myself . My mother made our usual breakfast of sugary tea , 
chapatis and fried egg . We all had breakfast together – me , my mother , my father , Khushal and Atal . It
was a big day for my mother as she was going to start lessons that afternoon to learn to read and write
with Miss Ulfat , my old teacher from kindergarten . 
My father started teasing Atal , who was eight by then and cheekier than ever .  ‘ Look , Atal , when
Malala is prime minister , you will be her secretary ,  ’ he said . 
Atal got very cross .  ‘ No , no , no !  ’ he said .  ‘ I ’ m no less than Malala . I will be prime minister and
she will be my secretary .  ’ All the banter meant I ended up being so late I only had time to eat half my
egg and no time to clear up . 
The Pakistan Studies paper went better than I thought it would . There were questions about how
Jinnah had created our country as the first Muslim homeland and also about the national tragedy of
how Bangladesh came into being . It was strange to think that Bangladesh was once part of Pakistan
despite being a thousand miles away . I answered all the questions and was confident I ’ d done well . I
was happy when the exam was over , chatting and gossiping with my friends as we waited for Sher
Mohammad Baba , a school assistant , to call for us when the bus arrived . 
The bus did two trips every day , and that day we took the second one . We liked staying on at
school and Moniba said ,  ‘ As we ’ re tired after the exam , let ’ s stay and chat before going home .  ’ I was
relieved that the Pakistan Studies exam had gone well so I agreed . I had no worries that day . I was
hungry but because we were fifteen we could no longer go outside to the street , so I got one of the
small girls to buy me a corn cob . I ate a little bit of it then gave it to another girl to finish . 
At twelve o ’ clock Baba called us over the loudspeaker . We all ran down the steps . The other girls
all covered their faces before emerging from the door and climbed into the back of the bus . I wore my
scarf over my head but never over my face . 
I asked Usman Bhai Jan to tell us a joke while we were waiting for two teachers to arrive . He has
a collection of extremely funny stories . That day instead of a story he did a magic trick to make a
pebble disappear .  ‘ Show us how you did it !  ’ we all clamoured , but he wouldn ’ t . 
When everyone was ready he took Miss Rubi and a couple of small children in the front cab with
him . Another little girl cried , saying she wanted to ride there too . Usman Bhai Jan said no , there was
no room ; she would have to stay in the back with us . But I felt sorry for her and persuaded him to let
her in the cab . 
Atal had been told by my mother to ride on the bus with me , so he walked over from the primary
school . He liked to hang off the tailboard at the back , which made Usman Bhai Jan cross as it was
dangerous . That day Usman Bhai Jan had had enough and refused to let him .  ‘ Sit inside , Atal Khan , or
I won ’ t take you !  ’ he said . Atal had a tantrum and refused so he walked home in a huff with some of
his friends . 
Usman Bhai Jan started the dyna and we were off . I was talking to Moniba , my wise , nice friend . 
Some girls were singing , I was drumming rhythms with my fingers on the seat . 
Moniba and I liked to sit near the open back so we could see out . At that time of day Haji Baba
Road was always a jumble of coloured rickshaws , people on foot and men on scooters , all zigzagging
and honking . An ice-cream boy on a red tricycle painted with red and white nuclear missiles rode up
behind waving at us , until a teacher shooed him away . A man was chopping off chickens ’ heads , the
blood dripping onto the street . I drummed my fingers . Chop , chop , chop . Drip , drip , drip . Funny , when
I was little we always said Swatis were so peace-loving it was hard to find a man to slaughter a
chicken . 
The air smelt of diesel , bread and kebab mixed with the stink from the stream where people still
dumped their rubbish and were never going to stop despite all my father ’ s campaigning . But we were
used to it . Besides , soon the winter would be here , bringing the snow , which would cleanse and
quieten everything . 
The bus turned right off the main road at the army checkpoint . On a kiosk was a poster of crazyeyed men with beards and caps or turbans under big letters saying wanted terrorists . The picture at the
top of a man with a black turban and beard was Fazlullah . More than three years had passed since the
military operation to drive the Taliban out of Swat had begun . We were grateful to the army but
couldn ’ t understand why they were still everywhere , in machine-gun nests on roofs and manning
checkpoints . Even to enter our valley people needed official permission . 
The road up the small hill is usually busy as it is a short cut but that day it was strangely quiet . 
 ‘ Where are all the people ?  ’ I asked Moniba . All the girls were singing and chatting and our voices
bounced around inside the bus . 
Around that time my mother was probably just going through the doorway into our school for her
first lesson since she had left school at age six . 
I didn ’ t see the two young men step out into the road and bring the van to a sudden halt . I didn ’ t get
a chance to answer their question ,  ‘ Who is Malala ?  ’ or I would have explained to them why they
should let us girls go to school as well as their own sisters and daughters . 
The last thing I remember is that I was thinking about the revision I needed to do for the next day . 
The sounds in my head were not the crack , crack , crack of three bullets , but the chop , chop , chop , 
drip , drip , drip of the man severing the heads of chickens , and them dropping into the dirty street , one
by one .

 ‘ God , I entrust her to you ’ 
AS SOON AS Usman Bhai Jan realised what had happened he drove the dyna to Swat Central Hospital
at top speed . 
The other girls were screaming and crying . I was lying on Moniba ’ s lap , bleeding from my head
and left ear . We had only gone a short way when a policeman stopped the van and started asking
questions , wasting precious time . One girl felt my neck for a pulse .  ‘ She ’ s alive !  ’ she shouted .  ‘ We
must get her to hospital . Leave us alone and catch the man who did this !  ’ 
Mingora seemed like a big town to us but it ’ s really a small place and the news spread quickly . My
father was at the Swat Press Club for a meeting of the Association of Private Schools and had just
gone on stage to give a speech when his mobile rang . He recognised the number as the Khushal
School and passed the phone to his friend Ahmad Shah to answer .  ‘ Your school bus has been fired
on ,  ’ he whispered urgently to my father . 
The colour drained from my father ’ s face . He immediately thought , Malala could be on that bus ! 
Then he tried to reassure himself , thinking it might be a boy , a jealous lover who had fired a pistol in
the air to shame his beloved . He was at an important gathering of about 400 principals who had come
from all over Swat to protest against plans by the government to impose a central regulatory authority . 
As president of their association , my father felt he couldn ’ t let all those people down so he delivered
his speech as planned . But there were beads of sweat on his forehead and for once there was no need
for anyone to signal to him to wind it up . 
As soon as he had finished , my father did not wait to take questions from the audience and instead
rushed off to the hospital with Ahmad Shah and another friend , Riaz , who had a car . The hospital was
only five minutes away . They arrived to find crowds gathered outside and photographers and TV
cameras . Then he knew for certain that I was there . My father ’ s heart sank . He pushed through the
people and ran through the camera flashes into the hospital . Inside I was lying on a trolley , a bandage
over my head , my eyes closed , my hair spread out . 
 ‘ My daughter , you are my brave daughter , my beautiful daughter ,  ’ he said over and over , kissing my
forehead and cheeks and nose . He didn ’ t know why he was speaking to me in English . I think
somehow I knew he was there even though my eyes were closed . My father said later ,  ‘ I can ’ t explain
it . I felt she responded .  ’ Someone said I had smiled . But to my father it was not a smile , just a small
beautiful moment because he knew he had not lost me for ever . Seeing me like that was the worst
thing that had ever happened to him . All children are special to their parents , but to my father I was
his universe . I had been his comrade in arms for so long , first secretly as Gul Makai , then quite openly
as Malala . He had always believed that if the Taliban came for anyone , it would be for him , not me . 
He said he felt as if he had been hit by a thunderbolt .  ‘ They wanted to kill two birds with one stone . 
Kill Malala and silence me for ever .  ’ 
He was very afraid but he didn ’ t cry . There were people everywhere . All the principals from the
meeting had arrived at the hospital and there were scores of media and activists ; it seemed the whole
town was there .  ‘ Pray for Malala ,  ’ he told them . The doctors reassured him that they had done a CT
scan which showed that the bullet had not gone near my brain . They cleaned and bandaged the wound . 
 ‘ O Ziauddin ! What have they done ?  ’ Madam Maryam burst through the doors . She had not been at
school that day but at home nursing her baby when she received a phone call from her brother-in-law
checking she was safe . Alarmed , she switched on the TV and saw the headline that there had been a
shooting on the Khushal School bus . As soon as she heard I had been shot she called her husband . He
brought her to the hospital on the back of his motorbike , something very rare for a respectable Pashtun
woman .  ‘ Malala , Malala . Do you hear me ?  ’ she called . 
I grunted . 
Maryam tried to find out more about what was going on . A doctor she knew told her the bullet had
passed through my forehead , not my brain , and that I was safe . She also saw the two other Khushal
girls who had been shot . Shazia had been hit twice , in the left collarbone and palm , and had been
brought to the hospital with me . Kainat had not realised she was hurt to start with and had gone home , 
then discovered she had been grazed by a bullet at the top of her right arm so her family had brought
her in . 
My father knew he should go and check on them but did not want to leave my bedside for a minute . 
His phone kept ringing . The chief minister of KPK was the first person who called .  ‘ Don ’ t worry , we
will sort everything out ,  ’ he said .  ‘ Lady Reading Hospital in Peshawar is expecting you .  ’ But it was
the army who took charge . At 3 p . m . the local commander arrived and announced they were sending
an army helicopter to take me and my father to Peshawar . There wasn ’ t time to fetch my mother so
Maryam insisted she would go too as I might need a woman ’ s help . Maryam ’ s family was not happy
about this as she was still nursing her baby boy , who had recently undergone a small operation . But
she is like my second mother . 
When I was put in the ambulance my father was afraid the Taliban would attack again . It seemed to
him that everyone must know who was inside . The helipad was only a mile away , a five-minute drive , 
but he was scared the whole way . When we got there the helicopter had not arrived , and we waited
for what to him felt like hours inside the ambulance . Finally it landed and I was taken on board with
my father , my cousin Khanjee , Ahmad Shah and Maryam . None of them had ever been on a helicopter . 
As it took off we flew over an army sports gala with patriotic music pounding from speakers . To hear
them singing about their love of country gave my father a bad taste . He normally liked singing along , 
but a patriotic song hardly seemed appropriate when here was a fifteen-year-old girl shot in the head , 
an almost dead daughter . 
Down below , my mother was watching from the roof of our house . When she heard that I had been
hurt she was having her reading lesson with Miss Ulfat and struggling to learn words like ‘ book ’ and
 ‘ apple ’  . The news at first was muddled and she initially believed I ’ d been in an accident and had
injured my foot . She rushed home and told my grandmother , who was staying with us at the time . She
begged my grandmother to start praying immediately . We believe Allah listens more closely to the
white-haired . My mother then noticed my half-eaten egg from breakfast . There were pictures of me
everywhere receiving the awards she had disapproved of . She sobbed as she looked at them . All
around was Malala , Malala . 
Soon the house was full of women . In our culture , if someone dies women come to the home of the
deceased and the men to the hujra – not just family and close friends but everyone from the
neighbourhood . 
My mother was astonished to see all the people . She sat on a prayer mat and recited from the
Quran . She told the women ,  ‘ Don ’ t cry – pray !  ’ Then my brothers rushed into the room . Atal , who had
walked home from school , had turned on the television and seen the news that I had been shot . He had
called Khushal , and together they joined the weeping . The phone did not stop ringing . People
reassured my mother that although I had been shot in the head , the bullet had just skimmed my
forehead . My mother was very confused by all the different stories , first that my foot had been injured , 
then that I had been shot in the head . She thought I would think it strange that she hadn ’ t come to me , 
but people told her not to go as I was either dead or about to be moved . One of my father ’ s friends
phoned her to tell her I was being taken to Peshawar by helicopter and she should come by road . The
worst moment for her was when someone came to the house with my front door keys , which had been
found at the scene of the shooting .  ‘ I don ’ t want keys , I want my daughter !  ’ my mother cried .  ‘ What
use are keys without Malala ?  ’ Then they heard the sound of the helicopter . 
The helipad was just a mile from our house and all the women rushed up to the roof .  ‘ It must be
Malala !  ’ they said . As they watched the helicopter fly overhead , my mother took her scarf off her
head , an extremely rare gesture for a Pashtun woman , and lifted it up to the sky , holding it in both
hands as if it was an offering .  ‘ God , I entrust her to You ,  ’ she said to the heavens .  ‘ We didn ’ t accept
security guards – You are our protector . She was under Your care and You are bound to give her
back .  ’ 
Inside the helicopter I was vomiting blood . My father was horrified , thinking this meant I had internal
bleeding . He was starting to lose hope . But then Maryam noticed me trying to wipe my mouth with my
scarf .  ‘ Look , she is responding !  ’ she said .  ‘ That ’ s an excellent sign .  ’ 
When we landed in Peshawar , they assumed we ’ d be taken to Lady Reading Hospital , where there
was a very good neurosurgeon called Dr Mumtaz who had been recommended . Instead they were
alarmed to be taken to CMH , the Combined Military Hospital . CMH is a large sprawling brick
hospital with 600 beds and dates from British rule . There was a lot of construction going on to build a
new tower block . Peshawar is the gateway to the FATA and since the army went into those areas in
2004 to take on the militants , the hospital had been very busy tending wounded soldiers and victims of
the frequent suicide bombs in and around the city . As in much of our country , there were concrete
blocks and checkpoints all around CMH to protect it from suicide bombers . 
I was rushed to the Intensive Care Unit , which is in a separate building . Above the nurses ’ station
the clock showed it was just after 5 p . m . I was wheeled into a glass-walled isolation unit and a nurse
put me on a drip . In the next room was a soldier who had been horrifically burned in an IED attack
and had a leg blown off . A young man came in and introduced himself as Colonel Junaid , a
neurosurgeon . My father became even more disturbed . He didn ’ t think he looked like a doctor ; he
seemed so young .  ‘ Is she your daughter ?  ’ asked the colonel . Maryam pretended to be my mother so
she could come in . 
Colonel Junaid examined me . I was conscious and restless but not speaking or aware of anything , 
my eyes fluttering . The colonel stitched the wound above my left brow where the bullet had entered , 
but he was surprised not to see any bullet in the scan .  ‘ If there is an entry there has to be an exit ,  ’ he
said . He palpated my spine and located the bullet lying next to my left shoulder blade .  ‘ She must have
been stooping so her neck was bent when she was shot ,  ’ he said . 
They took me for another CT scan . Then the colonel called my father into his office , where he had
the scans up on a screen . He told him that the scan in Swat had been done from only one angle , but this
new scan showed the injury was more serious .  ‘ Look , Ziauddin ,  ’ he said .  ‘ The CT scan shows the
bullet went very close to the brain .  ’ He said particles of bone had damaged the brain membrane .  ‘ We
can pray to God . Let ’ s wait and see ,  ’ he said .  ‘ We ’ re not going to operate at this stage .  ’ 
My father became more agitated . In Swat the doctors had told him this was something simple , now
it seemed very serious . And if it was serious why weren ’ t they operating ? He felt uncomfortable in a
military hospital . In our country , where the army has seized power so many times , people are often
wary of the military , particularly those from Swat , where the army had taken so long to act against the
Taliban . One of my father ’ s friends called him and said ,  ‘ Get her moved from that hospital . We don ’ t
want her to become shaheed millat [ a martyr of the nation ] like Liaquat Ali Khan .  ’ My father didn ’ t
know what to do . 
 ‘ I ’ m confused ,  ’ he told Colonel Junaid .  ‘ Why are we here ? I thought we ’ d go to the civil hospital .  ’ 
Then he asked ,  ‘ Please , can you bring in Dr Mumtaz ?  ’ 
 ‘ How would that look ?  ’ replied Colonel Junaid who was , not surprisingly , offended . 
Afterwards , we found out that despite his youthful appearance he had been a neurosurgeon for
thirteen years and was the most experienced and decorated neurosurgeon in the Pakistani army . He
had joined the military as a doctor because of their superior facilities , following in the footsteps of
his uncle , who was also an army neurosurgeon . The Peshawar CMH was on the front line of the war
on the Taliban and Junaid dealt with gunshot wounds and blasts every day .  ‘ I ’ ve treated thousands of
Malalas ,  ’ he later said . 
But my father didn ’ t know that at the time and became very depressed .  ‘ Do whatever you think ,  ’ he
said .  ‘ You ’ re the doctor .  ’ 
The next few hours were a wait-and-see time , the nurses monitoring my heartbeat and vital signs . 
Occasionally I made a low grunt and moved my hand or fluttered my eyes . Then Maryam would say , 
 ‘ Malala , Malala .  ’ Once my eyes completely opened .  ‘ I never noticed before how beautiful her eyes
are ,  ’ said Maryam . I was restless and kept trying to get the monitor off my finger .  ‘ Don ’ t do that ,  ’ 
Maryam said . 
 ‘ Miss , don ’ t tell me off ,  ’ I whispered as if we were at school . Madam Maryam was a strict
headmistress . 
Late in the evening my mother came with Atal . They had made the four-hour journey by road , 
driven by my father ’ s friend Mohammad Farooq . Before she arrived Maryam had called to warn her , 
 ‘ When you see Malala don ’ t cry or shout . She can hear you even if you think she can ’ t .  ’ My father
also called her and told her to prepare for the worst . He wanted to protect her . 
When my mother arrived they hugged and held back tears .  ‘ Here is Atal ,  ’ she told me .  ‘ He has
come to see you .  ’ 
Atal was overwhelmed and cried a lot .  ‘ Mama ,  ’ he wept ,  ‘ Malala is hurt so badly .  ’ 
My mother was in a state of shock and could not understand why the doctors were not operating to
remove the bullet .  ‘ My brave daughter , my beautiful daughter ,  ’ she cried . Atal was making so much
noise that eventually an orderly took them to the hospital ’ s military hostel , where they were being put
up . 
My father was bewildered by all the people gathered outside – politicians , government dignitaries , 
provincial ministers – who had come to show their sympathy . Even the governor was there ; he gave
my father 100 , 000 rupees for my treatment . In our society if someone dies , you feel very honoured if
one dignitary comes to your home . But now he was irritated . He felt all these people were just
waiting for me to die when they had done nothing to protect me . 
Later , while they were eating , Atal turned on the TV . My father immediately turned it off . He
couldn ’ t face seeing news of my attack at that moment . When he left the room Maryam switched it back
on . Every channel was showing footage of me with a commentary of prayers and moving poems as if I
had died .  ‘ My Malala , my Malala ,  ’ my mother wailed and Maryam joined her . 
Around midnight Colonel Junaid asked to meet my father outside the ICU .  ‘ Ziauddin , Malala ’ s
brain is swelling .  ’ My father didn ’ t understand what this meant . The doctor told him I had started to
deteriorate ; my consciousness was fading , and I had again been vomiting blood . Colonel Junaid
ordered a third CT scan . This showed that my brain was swelling dangerously . 
 ‘ But I thought the bullet hadn ’ t entered her brain ,  ’ said my father . 
Colonel Junaid explained that a bone had fractured and splinters had gone into my brain , creating a
shock and causing it to swell . He needed to remove some of my skull to give the brain space to
expand , otherwise the pressure would become unbearable .  ‘ We need to operate now to give her a
chance ,  ’ he said .  ‘ If we don ’ t , she may die . I don ’ t want you to look back and regret not taking action .  ’ 
Cutting away some of my skull sounded very drastic to my father .  ‘ Will she survive ?  ’ he asked
desperately , but was given little reassurance at that stage . 
It was a brave decision by Colonel Junaid , whose superiors were not convinced and were being
told by other people that I should be sent abroad . It was a decision that would save my life . My father
told him to go ahead , and Colonel Junaid said he would bring in Dr Mumtaz to help . My father ’ s hand
shook as he signed the consent papers . There in black and white were the words ‘ the patient may die ’  . 
They started the operation around 1 . 30 a . m . My mother and father sat outside the operating theatre . 
 ‘ O God , please make Malala well ,  ’ prayed my father . He made bargains with God .  ‘ Even if I have to
live in the deserts of the Sahara , I need her eyes open ; I won ’ t be able to live without her . O God , let
me give the rest of my life to her ; I have lived enough . Even if she is injured , just let her survive .  ’ 
Eventually my mother interrupted him .  ‘ God is not a miser ,  ’ she said .  ‘ He will give me back my
daughter as she was .  ’ She began praying with the Holy Quran in her hand , standing facing the wall , 
reciting verses over and over for hours . 
 ‘ I had never seen someone praying like her ,  ’ said Madam Maryam .  ‘ I was sure God would answer
such prayers .  ’ 
My father tried not to think about the past and whether he had been wrong to encourage me to speak
out and campaign . 
Inside the theatre Colonel Junaid used a saw to remove an eight-to-ten-centimetre square from the
upper-left part of my skull so my brain had the space to swell . He then cut into the subcutaneous tissue
on the left of my stomach and placed the piece of bone inside to preserve it . Then he did a
tracheotomy as he was worried the swelling was blocking my airway . He also removed clots from my
brain and the bullet from my shoulder blade . After all these procedures I was put on a ventilator . The
operation took almost five hours . 
Despite my mother ’ s prayers , my father thought ninety per cent of the people waiting outside were
just waiting for the news of my death . Some of them , his friends and sympathisers , were very upset , 
but he felt that others were jealous of our high profile and believed we had got what was coming to
us . 
My father was taking a short break from the intensity of the operating theatre and was standing
outside when a nurse approached him .  ‘ Are you Malala ’ s father ?  ’ Once again my father ’ s heart sank . 
The nurse took him into a room . 
He thought she was going to say ,  ‘ We ’ re sorry , I ’ m afraid we have lost her .  ’ But once inside he
was told ,  ‘ We need someone to get blood from the blood bank .  ’ He was relieved but baffled . Am I
the only person who can fetch it ? he wondered . One of his friends went instead . 
It was about 5 . 30 a . m . when the surgeons came out . Among other things , they told my father that
they had removed a piece of skull and put it in my abdomen . In our culture doctors don ’ t explain
things to patients or relatives , and my father asked humbly ,  ‘ If you don ’ t mind , I have a stupid
question . Will she survive – what do you think ?  ’ 
 ‘ In medicine two plus two does not always make four ,  ’ replied Colonel Junaid .  ‘ We did our job –
we removed the piece of skull . Now we must wait .  ’ 
 ‘ I have another stupid question ,  ’ said my father .  ‘ What about this bone ? What will you do with it ?  ’ 
 ‘ After three months we will put it back ,  ’ replied Dr Mumtaz .  ‘ It ’ s very simple , just like this .  ’ He
clapped his hands . 
The next morning the news was good . I had moved my arms . Then three top surgeons from the
province came to examine me . They said Colonel Junaid and Dr Mumtaz had done a splendid job , and
the operation had gone very well , but I should now be put into an induced coma because if I regained
consciousness there would be pressure on the brain . 
While I was hovering between life and death , the Taliban issued a statement assuming
responsibility for shooting me but denying it was because of my campaign for education .  ‘ We carried
out this attack , and anybody who speaks against us will be attacked in the same way ,  ’ said Ehsanullah
Ehsan , a spokesman for the TTP .  ‘ Malala has been targeted because of her pioneer role in preaching
secularism .  .  . She was young but she was promoting Western culture in Pashtun areas . She was proWest ; she was speaking against the Taliban ; she was calling President Obama her idol .  ’ 
My father knew what he was referring to . After I won the National Peace Prize the year before , I
had done many TV interviews and in one of them I had been asked to name my favourite politicians . I
had chosen Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan , Benazir Bhutto and President Barack Obama . I had read about
Obama and admired him because as a young black man from a struggling family he had achieved his
ambitions and dreams . But the image of America in Pakistan had become of one of drones , secret
raids on our territory and Raymond Davis . 
A Taliban spokesman said that Fazlullah had ordered the attack at a meeting two months earlier . 
 ‘ Anyone who sides with the government against us will die at our hands ,  ’ he said .  ‘ You will see . 
Other important people will soon become victims .  ’ He added they had used two local Swati men who
had collected information about me and my route to school and had deliberately carried out the attack
near an army checkpoint to show they could strike anywhere . 
That first morning , just a few hours after my operation , there was suddenly a flurry of activity , people
neatening their uniforms and clearing up . Then General Kayani , the army chief , swept in .  ‘ The
nation ’ s prayers are with you and your daughter ,  ’ he told my father . I had met General Kayani when
he came to Swat for a big meeting at the end of 2009 after the campaign against the Taliban . 
 ‘ I am happy you did a splendid job ,  ’ I had said at that meeting .  ‘ Now you just need to catch
Fazlullah .  ’ The hall filled with applause and General Kayani came over and put his hand on my head
like a father . 
Colonel Junaid gave the general a briefing on the surgery and the proposed treatment plan , and
General Kayani told him he should send the CT scans abroad to the best experts for advice . After his
visit no one else was allowed at my bedside because of the risk of infection . But many kept coming : 
Imran Khan , the cricketer-turned-politician ; Mian Iftikhar Hussein , the provincial information minister
and outspoken critic of the Taliban , whose only son had been shot dead by them ; and the chief
minister of our province , Haider Hoti , with whom I had appeared on talk-show discussions . None of
them was allowed in . 
 ‘ Rest assured Malala will not die ,  ’ Hoti told people .  ‘ She still has lots to do .  ’ 
Then around 3 p . m . in the afternoon two British doctors arrived by helicopter from Rawalpindi . Dr
Javid Kayani and Dr Fiona Reynolds were from hospitals in Birmingham and happened to be in
Pakistan advising the army on how to set up the country ’ s first liver transplant programme . Our
country is full of shocking statistics , not just on education , and one of them is that one in seven
children in Pakistan gets hepatitis , largely because of dirty needles , and many die of liver disease . 
General Kayani was determined to change this , and the army had once again stepped in where the
civilians had failed . He had asked the doctors to brief him on their progress before flying home , 
which happened to be the morning after I had been shot . When they went in to see him he had two
televisions on , one tuned to a local channel in Urdu and the other to Sky News in English , with news
of my shooting . 
The army chief and the doctor were not related despite sharing a surname but knew each other well
so the general told Dr Javid he was worried about the conflicting reports he was receiving and asked
him to assess me before flying back to the UK . Dr Javid , who is an emergency care consultant at
Queen Elizabeth Hospital , agreed , but asked to take Dr Fiona as she is from Birmingham Children ’ s
Hospital and a specialist in children ’ s intensive care . She was nervous about going to Peshawar , 
which has become a no-go area for foreigners , but when she heard that I was a campaigner for girls ’ 
education she was happy to help as she herself had been lucky to go to a good school and train to
become a doctor . 
Colonel Junaid and the hospital director were not pleased to see them . There was some argument
until Dr Javid made it clear who had sent them . The British doctors were not happy with what they
found . First they turned on a tap to wash their hands and discovered there was no water . Then Dr
Fiona checked the machines and levels and muttered something to Dr Javid . She asked when my
blood pressure had last been checked .  ‘ Two hours ago ,  ’ came the reply . She said it needed to be
checked all the time and asked a nurse why there was no arterial line . She also complained that my
carbon dioxide level was far too low . 
My father was glad he didn ’ t hear what she had told Dr Javid . She had said I was ‘ salvageable ’ – I
had had the right surgery at the right time – but my chances of recovery were now being compromised
by the aftercare . After neurosurgery it is essential to monitor breathing and gas exchange , and CO2
levels are supposed to be kept in the normal range . That ’ s what all the tubes and machines were
monitoring . Dr Javid said it was ‘ like flying an aircraft – you can only do it using the right
instruments ’  , and even if the hospital had them they weren ’ t being used properly . Then they left in
their helicopter because it is dangerous to be in Peshawar after dark . 
Among the visitors who came and were not allowed in was Rehman Malik , the interior minister . 
He had brought with him a passport for me . My father thanked him but he was very upset . That night
when he went back to the army hostel , he took the passport from his pocket and gave it to my mother . 
 ‘ This is Malala ’ s , but I don ’ t know whether it ’ s to go abroad or to the heavens ,  ’ he said . They both
cried . In their bubble inside the hospital they did not realise that my story had travelled all round the
world and that people were calling for me to be sent abroad for treatment . 
My condition was deteriorating and my father now rarely picked up his calls . One of the few he
took was from the parents of Arfa Karim , a child computer genius from Punjab with whom I had
spoken during forums . She had become the youngest Microsoft-certified professional in the world at
the age of nine for her skill at programming and had even been invited to meet Bill Gates in Silicon
Valley . But tragically she had died that January of a heart attack following an epileptic fit . She was
just sixteen , one year older than me . When her father called , my father cried .  ‘ Tell me how can one
live without daughters ,  ’ he sobbed .

Journey into the Unknown
I WAS SHOT ON a Tuesday at lunchtime . By Thursday morning my father was so convinced that I would
die that he told my uncle Faiz Mohammad that the village should start preparing for my funeral . I had
been put into an induced coma , my vital signs were deteriorating , my face and body were swollen and
my kidneys and lungs failing . My father later told me that it was terrifying to see me connected to all
the tubes in that small glass cubicle . As far as he could see , I was medically dead . He was
devastated .  ‘ It ’ s too early , she ’ s only 15 ,  ’ he kept thinking .  ‘ Is her life to be so short ?  ’ 
My mother was still praying – she had barely slept . Faiz Mohammad had told her she should recite
the Surah of the Haj , the chapter of the Quran about pilgrimage , and she recited over and over again
the same twelve verses ( 58–70 ) about the all-powerfulness of God . She told my father she felt I
would live but he could not see how . 
When Colonel Junaid came to check on me , my father again asked him ,  ‘ Will she survive ?  ’ 
 ‘ Do you believe in God ?  ’ the doctor asked him . 
 ‘ Yes ,  ’ said my father . Colonel Junaid seemed to be a man of great spiritual depth . His advice was
to appeal to God and that He would answer our prayers . 
Late on Wednesday night two military doctors who were intensive care specialists had arrived by
road from Islamabad . They had been sent by General Kayani after the British doctors had reported
back to him that if I was left in Peshawar I would suffer brain damage or might even die because of
the quality of the care and the high risk of infection . They wanted to move me but suggested that in the
meantime a top doctor be brought in . But it seemed they were too late . 
The hospital staff had made none of the changes Dr Fiona had recommended , and my condition had
deteriorated as the night went on . Infection had set in . On Thursday morning one of the specialists , 
Brigadier Aslam , called Dr Fiona .  ‘ Malala is now very sick ,  ’ he told her . I had developed something
called disseminated intravascular coagulation ( DIC )  , which meant my blood was not clotting , my
blood pressure was very low and my blood acid had risen . I wasn ’ t passing urine any more so my
kidneys were failing and my lactate levels had risen . It seemed that everything that could go wrong , 
had . Dr Fiona was about to leave for the airport to fly back to Birmingham – her bags were already at
the airport – but when she heard the news , she offered to help and two nurses from her hospital in
Birmingham stayed on with her . 
She arrived back in Peshawar at lunchtime on Thursday . She told my father that I was to be
airlifted to an army hospital in Rawalpindi which had the best intensive care . He couldn ’ t see how a
child so sick could fly , but Dr Fiona assured him that she did this all the time so not to worry . He
asked her if there was any hope for me .  ‘ Had there been no hope I would not be here ,  ’ she replied . 
My father says that in that moment he could not hold back his tears . 
Later that day a nurse came and put drops in my eyes .  ‘ Look , Khaista ,  ’ said my mother .  ‘ Dr Fiona
is right because the nurses put eye drops in Malala ’ s eyes . They wouldn ’ t put drops in if there was no
chance .  ’ One of the other girls who had been shot , Shazia , had been moved to the same hospital and
Fiona went to check on her . She told my father that Shazia was fine and had begged her ,  ‘ Look after
Malala !  ’ 
We were taken to the helipad by ambulance under high security with motorcycle outriders and
flashing blue lights . The helicopter flight was one hour and fifteen minutes . Dr Fiona hardly sat down ; 
she was so busy the whole way with all the different equipment that it looked to my father as if she
was fighting with it . She was doing what she had been doing for years . Half her work in the UK was
moving critically ill children , the other half was treating them in intensive care . But she had never
been in a situation quite like this . Not only was Peshawar dangerous for Westerners but after googling
me she realised this was no ordinary case .  ‘ If anything had happened to her it would have been
blamed on the white woman ,  ’ she said afterwards .  ‘ If she ’ d died I would have killed Pakistan ’ s
Mother Teresa .  ’ 
As soon as we landed in Rawalpindi we were taken by ambulance with another military escort to a
hospital called the Armed Forces Institute of Cardiology . My father was alarmed – how would they
know how to deal with head wounds ? But Dr Fiona assured him it had the best intensive care in
Pakistan with state-of-the-art equipment and British-trained doctors . Her own nurses from
Birmingham were there waiting and had explained to the cardiology nurses the specific procedures
for dealing with head injuries . They spent the next three hours with me , swapping my antibiotics and
my blood lines as I seemed to be reacting badly to the blood transfusions . Finally they said I was
stable . 
The hospital had been put on complete lockdown . There was an entire battalion of soldiers
guarding it and even snipers on the rooftops . No one was allowed in ; doctors had to wear uniforms ; 
patients could only be visited by close relatives , all of whom underwent strict security checks . An
army major was assigned to my parents and followed them everywhere . 
My father was scared and my uncle kept saying ,  ‘ Be very careful – some of these people might be
secret agents .  ’ My family was given three rooms in the officers ’ hostel . Everyone ’ s mobile phone was
confiscated , which they said was for security reasons but may have also been to stop my father talking
to the media . Any time my parents wanted to take the short walk from the hostel to the hospital they
first had to be cleared via walkie-talkie , which took at least half an hour . They were even guarded as
they crossed the hostel lawn to the dining hall . No visitors could get in – even when the Prime
Minister came to see me he was not allowed inside . The security seemed astonishing , but over the last
three years the Taliban had managed to infiltrate and attack even the most highly guarded military
installations – the naval base at Mehran , the air force base in Kamra and the army headquarters just
down the road . 
We were all at risk from a Taliban attack . My father was told that even my brothers would not be
spared . He was very concerned because at that time Khushal was still in Mingora , although later he
was brought down to Rawalpindi to join them . There were no computers or Internet in the hostel but a
friendly cook , Yaseem Mama , used to bring my family the newspapers and whatever they needed . 
Yaseem told them he felt proud to prepare my family ’ s food . They were so touched by his kindness
that they shared our story with him . He wanted to nourish them with food and ease their suffering . 
They had no appetite so he would try to tempt them with ever more delicious dishes , custards and
sweets . One mealtime Khushal said that the dining table felt empty with only the four of them . They
felt incomplete without me . 
It was in one of Yaseem ’ s newspapers that my father read for the first time some of the incredible
international reaction to my shooting . It seemed like the whole world was outraged . Ban Ki-moon , the
UN Secretary General , called it ‘ a heinous and cowardly act ’  . President Obama described the
shooting as ‘ reprehensible and disgusting and tragic ’  . But some of the reaction in Pakistan was not so
positive . While some papers described me as a ‘ peace icon ’  , others carried the usual conspiracy
theories , some bloggers even questioning if I had really been shot . All sorts of stories were made up , 
particularly in the Urdu press , such as one that claimed I had criticised the growing of beards . One of
the most vocal people against me was a female MP called Dr Raheela Qazi from the religious
Jamaate-Islami party . She called me an American stooge and showed a photograph of me sitting next
to Ambassador Richard Holbrooke as evidence of me ‘ hobnobbing with US military authority ’  ! 
Dr Fiona was a great comfort to us . My mother speaks only Pashto so couldn ’ t understand anything
she said , but Fiona would gesture with a thumbs-up when she came out of my room and say ‘ Good .  ’ 
She became a messenger for my parents , not only a doctor . She would sit with them patiently and
would then ask my father to explain every detail to my mother . My father was astonished and pleased
– in our country few doctors bother explaining anything to an illiterate woman . They heard that offers
were pouring in from overseas to treat me including fromAmerica , where a top hospital called Johns
Hopkins had offered free treatment . Individual Americans also offered to help , including Senator John
Kerry , a rich man who had visited Pakistan many times , and Gabrielle Giffords , a congresswoman
who had been shot in the head while meeting constituents at a shopping mall in Arizona . There were
offers too from Germany , Singapore , the UAE and Britain . 
Nobody consulted my mother and father on what should happen to me . All decisions were made by
the army . General Kayani asked Dr Javid whether I should be sent abroad or not . The army chief was
spending a surprising amount of his time on the issue – Dr Javid says they spent six hours discussing
me ! Perhaps more than any politician he understood the political implications if I did not survive . He
was hoping to build a political consensus behind launching an all-out attack on the Taliban . But also
those close to him say he is a compassionate man . His own father was just an ordinary soldier and
died young , leaving him as the eldest son of eight to support his entire family . When he became army
chief the first thing General Kayani did was improve housing , food rations and education for ordinary
soldiers rather than officers . 
Dr Fiona said it was likely I would have a speech impediment and a weak right arm and right leg , 
so I would need extensive rehabilitation facilities , which Pakistan didn ’ t have .  ‘ If you ’ re serious
about getting the best outcome possible , take her overseas ,  ’ she advised . 
General Kayani was adamant that the Americans should not be involved because of the ongoing
bad relations between the two countries after the Raymond Davis episode and the bin Laden raid as
well as the killing of some Pakistani soldiers at a border post by a US helicopter . Dr Javid suggested
Great Ormond Street in London , and specialist hospitals in Edinburgh and Glasgow .  ‘ Why not your
own hospital ?  ’ General Kayani asked . 
Dr Javid had known this was coming . Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham is known for
treating British soldiers wounded in Afghanistan and Iraq . Its location outside the centre of the city
also offered privacy . He called his boss Kevin Bolger , the hospital ’ s chief operating officer . He
quickly agreed it was the right thing to do , although afterwards he said ,  ‘ None of us ever imagined
how much it would take over the hospital .  ’ Moving me – a foreign minor – to the Queen Elizabeth
Hospital was not a simple exercise , and Bolger soon found himself tangled in the hoops of British and
Pakistani bureaucracy . Meanwhile time was ticking away . Although my condition had been stabilised
it was felt that I needed to be moved within forty-eight hours , seventy-two at the most . 
Finally the go-ahead was given and the doctors had to face the problem of how I was to be moved
and who would pay for it . Dr Javid suggested taking up an offer from the Royal Air Force as they
were used to transporting wounded soldiers fromAfghanistan , but General Kayani refused . He called
Dr Javid for a late-night meeting at his house – the general keeps late hours – and explained , chainsmoking as usual , that he did not want any foreign military involved . There were already too many
conspiracy theories floating around about my shooting , people saying I was a CIA agent and such
things , and the army chief did not want to further fuel them . This left Dr Javid in a difficult position . 
The British government had offered assistance but needed a formal request from the Pakistan
government . But my government was reluctant to ask for fear of loss of face . Fortunately at this point
the ruling family of the United Arab Emirates stepped in . They offered their private jet , which had its
own on-board hospital . I was to be flown out of Pakistan for the first time in my life in the early hours
of Monday , 15 October . 
My parents had no idea of any of these negotiations though they knew discussions were under way
to move me overseas . Naturally they assumed that wherever I was sent , they would accompany me . 
My mother and brothers had no passports or documentation . On Sunday afternoon my father was
informed by the colonel that I would be leaving the next morning for the UK and only he was to
accompany me , not my mother or my brothers . He was told there was a problem arranging their
passports and that for security reasons he should not even tell the rest of my family he was going . 
My father shares everything with my mother and there was no way he would keep such a thing
secret . He told her the news with a heavy heart . My mother was sitting with uncle Faiz Mohammad , 
who was furious and worried about her and my brothers ’ security .  ‘ If she ’ s on her own with two boys
in Mingora , anything could happen to them !  ’ 
My father called the colonel .  ‘ I have informed my family and they are very unhappy . I cannot leave
them .  ’ This caused a big problem because I was a minor so couldn ’ t be sent alone and many people
got involved to try and convince my father to come with me , including Colonel Junaid , Dr Javid and
Dr Fiona . My father does not respond well to being pushed and remained firm even though it was
clear that by now he was creating havoc . He explained to Dr Javid ,  ‘ My daughter is now in safe
hands and going to a safe country . I can ’ t leave my wife and sons alone here . They are at risk . What
has happened to my daughter has happened and now she is in God ’ s hands . I am a father – my sons are
as important to me as my daughter .  ’ 
Dr Javid asked to see my father privately .  ‘ Are you sure this is the only reason you are not
coming ?  ’ he asked . He wanted to make sure no one was pressuring him . 
 ‘ My wife told me ,  “ You can ’ t leave us ,  ”  ’ my father said . The doctor put a hand on his shoulder and
reassured my father that I would be taken care of and he could trust him .  ‘ Isn ’ t it a miracle you all
happened to be here when Malala was shot ?  ’ said my father . 
 ‘ It is my belief God sends the solution first and the problem later ,  ’ replied Dr Javid . 
My father then signed an ‘ in loco parentis ’ document making Dr Fiona my guardian for the trip to
the UK . My father was in tears as he gave her my passport and took her hand . 
 ‘ Fiona , I trust you . Please take care of my daughter .  ’ 
Then my mother and father came to my bedside to say goodbye . It was around 11 p . m . when they
saw me for the last time in Pakistan . I could not speak , my eyes were shut and it was only my breath
that reassured them I was still alive . My mother cried , but my father tried to comfort her as he felt I
was now out of danger . All those deadlines they ’ d given at the beginning – when they said the next
twenty-four hours were dangerous , forty-eight were crucial , seventy-two were critical – had all
passed without incident . The swelling had gone down and my blood levels had improved . My family
trusted that Dr Fiona and Dr Javid would give me the best possible care . 
When my family went back to their rooms sleep was slow in coming . Just after midnight someone
knocked at their door . It was one of the colonels who had earlier tried to convince my father to leave
my mother behind and travel to the UK . He told my father that he absolutely had to travel with me or I
might not be taken at all . 
 ‘ I told you last night the issue was resolved ,  ’ my father replied .  ‘ Why did you wake me ? I ’ m not
leaving my family .  ’ 
Once again , another official was called to talk to him .  ‘ You must go . You are her parent , and if you
don ’ t accompany her she may not be accepted into the hospital in the UK ,  ’ he said . 
 ‘ What ’ s done is done ,  ’ my father insisted .  ‘ I am not changing my mind . We will all follow in a few
days when the documents are sorted out .  ’ 
The colonel then said ,  ‘ Let ’ s go to the hospital as there are other documents to sign .  ’ 
My father became suspicious . It was after midnight and he was scared . He didn ’ t want to go alone
with the officials and insisted my mother come too . My father was so worried that for the whole time
he repeated a verse of the Holy Quran over and over . It was from the story of Yunus who is
swallowed by a whale like the story of Jonah in the Bible . This verse was recited by the prophet
Yunus when he was in the tummy of the whale . It reassures us that there is a way out of even the worst
trouble and danger if we keep faith . 
When they got to the hospital the colonel told my father that if I was to be allowed to fly to the UK
then there were other documents that needed to be signed . It was simple . My father had felt so
uncomfortable and scared because of the secrecy of all the arrangements , the men in uniform
everywhere and the vulnerability of our family , that he had panicked and blown the incident out of
proportion . The whole episode had been a matter of botched bureaucracy . 
When my parents finally got back to the hostel it was with a very heavy heart . My father did not
want me to come round in a strange country without my family there . He was worried about how
confused I would be . My last memory would be of the school bus , and he was distraught that I would
feel abandoned by them . 
I was taken away at 5 a . m . on Monday , 15 October under armed escort . The roads to the airport
had been closed and there were snipers on the rooftops of the buildings lining the route . The UAE
plane was waiting . I am told it is the height of luxury with a plush double bed , sixteen first-class seats
and a mini-hospital at the back staffed with European nurses led by a German doctor . I am just sorry I
wasn ’ t conscious to enjoy it . The plane flew to Abu Dhabi for refuelling then headed on to
Birmingham , where it landed in the late afternoon . 
In the hostel my parents waited . They assumed their passports and visas were being processed and
they would join me in a few days . But they heard nothing . They had no phone and no access to a
computer to check on my progress . The wait felt endless .

 ‘ The Girl Shot in the Head , Birmingham ’ 
I WOKE UP on 16 October , a week after the shooting . I was thousands of miles away from home with a
tube in my neck to help me breathe and unable to speak . I was on the way back to critical care after
another CT scan , and flitted between consciousness and sleep until I woke properly . 
The first thing I thought when I came round was , Thank God I ’ m not dead . But I had no idea where
I was . I knew I was not in my homeland . The nurses and doctors were speaking English though they
seemed to all be from different countries . I was speaking to them but no one could hear me because of
the tube in my neck . To start with my left eye was very blurry and everyone had two noses and four
eyes . All sorts of questions flew through my waking brain : Where was I ? Who had brought me
there ? Where were my parents ? Was my father alive ? I was terrified . 
Dr Javid , who was there when I was brought round , says he will never forget the look of fear and
bewilderment on my face . He spoke to me in Urdu . The only thing I knew was that Allah had blessed
me with a new life . A nice lady in a headscarf held my hand and said ,  ‘ Asalaamu alaikum ,  ’ which is
our traditional Muslim greeting . Then she started saying prayers in Urdu and reciting verses of the
Quran . She told me her name was Rehanna and she was the Muslim chaplain . Her voice was soft and
her words were soothing , and I drifted back to sleep . 
I dreamed I wasn ’ t really in hospital . 
When I woke again the next day I noticed I was in a strange green room with no windows and very
bright lights . It was an intensive care cubicle in the Queen Elizabeth Hospital . Everything was very
clean and shiny , not like the hospital in Mingora . 
A nurse gave me a pencil and a pad . I couldn ’ t write properly . The words came out wrong . I
wanted to write my father ’ s phone number . I couldn ’ t space letters . Dr Javid brought me an alphabet
board so I could point to the letters . The first words I spelt out were ‘ father ’ and ‘ country ’  . The nurse
told me I was in Birmingham , but I had no idea where that was . Only later did they bring me an atlas
so I could see it was in England . I didn ’ t know what had happened . The nurses weren ’ t telling me
anything . Even my name . Was I still Malala ? 
My head was aching so much that even the injections they gave me couldn ’ t stop the pain . My left
ear kept bleeding and my left hand felt funny . Nurses and doctors kept coming in and out . The nurses
asked me questions and told me to blink twice for yes . No one told me what was going on or who had
brought me to the hospital . I thought they didn ’ t know themselves . I could feel that the left side of my
face wasn ’ t working properly . If I looked at the nurses or doctors for too long my left eye watered . I
didn ’ t seem to be able to hear from my left ear and my jaw wouldn ’ t move properly . I gestured to
people to stand on my right . 
Then a kind lady called Dr Fiona came and gave me a white teddy bear . She said I should call it
Junaid and she would explain why later . I didn ’ t know who Junaid was so I named it Lily . She also
brought me a pink exercise book to write in . The first two questions my pen wrote were ,  ‘ Why have I
no father ?  ’ and ‘ My father has no money . Who will pay for all this ?  ’ 
 ‘ Your father is safe ,  ’ she replied .  ‘ He is in Pakistan . Don ’ t worry about payment .  ’ 
I repeated the questions to anyone who came in . They all said the same . But I was not convinced . I
had no idea what had happened to me and I didn ’ t trust anyone . If my father was fine , why wasn ’ t he
here ? I thought my parents didn ’ t know where I was and could be searching for me in the chowks and
bazaars of Mingora . I didn ’ t believe my parents were safe . Those first days my mind kept drifting in
and out of a dream world . I kept having flashbacks to lying on a bed with men around me , so many
that you couldn ’ t count , and asking ,  ‘ Where is my father ?  ’ I thought I had been shot but wasn ’ t sure –
were these dreams or memories ? 
I was obsessed by how much this must be costing . The money from the awards had almost all gone
on the school and buying a plot of land in our village in Shangla . Whenever I saw the doctors talking
to one another I thought they were saying ,  ‘ Malala doesn ’ t have any money . Malala can ’ t pay for her
treatment .  ’ One of the doctors was a Polish man who always looked sad . I thought he was the owner
of the hospital and was unhappy because I couldn ’ t pay . So I gestured at a nurse for paper and wrote , 
 ‘ Why are you sad ?  ’ He replied ,  ‘ No , I am not sad .  ’  ‘ Who will pay ?  ’ I wrote .  ‘ We don ’ t have any
money .  ’  ‘ Don ’ t worry , your government will pay ,  ’ he said . Afterwards he always smiled when he
saw me . 
I always think about solutions to problems so I thought maybe I could go down to the reception of
the hospital and ask for a phone to call my mother and father . But my brain was telling me , You don ’ t
have the money to pay for the call nor do you know the country code . Then I thought , I need to go
out and start working to earn money so I can buy a phone and call my father so we can all be
together again . 
Everything was so mixed up in my mind . I thought the teddy bear Dr Fiona had given me was green
and had been swapped with a white one .  ‘ Where ’ s the green teddy ?  ’ I kept asking , even though I was
told over and over there was no green teddy . The green was probably the glow of the walls in the
intensive care unit but I ’ m still convinced there was a green teddy . 
I kept forgetting English words . One note to the nurses was ‘ a wire to clean my teeth ’  . It felt like
something was stuck between them and I meant floss . Actually my tongue was numb and my teeth
were fine . The only thing that calmed me was when Rehanna came . She said healing prayers and I
started moving my lips to some of them and mouthing ‘ Amin ’  ( our word for ‘ amen ’  ) at the end . The
television was kept off , except once when they let me watch Masterchef which I used to watch in
Mingora and loved but everything was blurred . It was only later I learned that people were not
allowed to bring in newspapers or tell me anything as the doctors were worried it could traumatise
me . 
I was terrified that my father could be dead . Then Fiona brought in a Pakistani newspaper from the
week before which had a photograph of my father talking to General Kayani with a shawled figure
sitting at the back next to my brother . I could just see her feet .  ‘ That ’ s my mother !  ’ I wrote . 
Later that day Dr Javid came in with his mobile phone .  ‘ We ’ re going to call your parents ,  ’ he said . 
My eyes shone with excitement .  ‘ You won ’ t cry , you won ’ t weep ,  ’ he instructed me . He was gruff but
very kind , like he had known me for ever .  ‘ I will give you the mobile and be strong .  ’ I nodded . He
dialled the number , spoke and then gave me the phone . 
There was my father ’ s voice . I couldn ’ t talk because of the tube in my neck . But I was so happy to
hear him . I couldn ’ t smile because of my face , but it was as if there was a smile inside .  ‘ I ’ ll come
soon ,  ’ he promised .  ‘ Now have a rest and in two days we will be there .  ’ Later he told me that Dr
Javid had also ordered him not to cry as that would make us all sadder . The doctor wanted us to be
strong for each other . The call did not last long because my parents did not want to tire me out . My
mother blessed me with prayers . 
I still presumed that the reason they weren ’ t with me was because my father didn ’ t have the money
to pay for my treatment . That ’ s why he was still in Pakistan , to sell our land in the village and also
our school . But our land was small and I knew our school buildings and our house were rented , so
what could he sell ? Perhaps he was asking rich people for a loan .  
* 
Even after the call , my parents were not completely reassured . They hadn ’ t actually heard my voice
and were still cut off from the outside world . People who visited them were bringing conflicting
reports . One of those visitors was Major General Ghulam Qamar , head of military operations in
Swat .  ‘ There is good news coming from the UK ,  ’ he told my father .  ‘ We are very happy our daughter
has survived .  ’ He said ‘ our ’ because now I was seen as the daughter of the nation . 
The general told my father that they were carrying out door-to-door searches throughout Swat and
monitoring the borders . He said they knew that the people who had targeted me came from a gang of
twenty-two Taliban men and that they were the same gang who had attacked Zahid Khan , my father ’ s
friend who had been shot two months earlier . 
My father said nothing but he was outraged . The army had been saying for ages that there were no
Taliban in Mingora and that they had cleared them all out . Now this general was telling him that there
had been twenty-two of them in our town for at least two months . The army had also insisted Zahid
Khan was shot in a family feud and not by the Taliban . Now they were saying I had been targeted by
the same Taliban as him . My father wanted to say ,  ‘ You knew there were Taliban in the valley for
two months . You knew they wanted to kill my daughter and you didn ’ t stop them ?  ’ But he realised it
would get him nowhere . 
The general hadn ’ t finished . He told my father that although it was good news that I had regained
consciousness there was a problem with my eyesight . My father was confused . How could the officer
have information he didn ’ t ? He was worried that I would be blind . He imagined his beloved daughter , 
her face shining , walking around in lifelong darkness asking ,  ‘ Aba , where am I ?  ’ So awful was this
news that he couldn ’ t tell my mother , even though he is usually hopeless at keeping secrets , 
particularly from her . Instead he told God ,  ‘ This is unacceptable . I will give her one of my own eyes .  ’ 
But then he was worried that at forty-three years old his own eyes might not be very good . He hardly
slept that night . The next morning he asked the major in charge of security if he could borrow his
phone to call Colonel Junaid .  ‘ I have heard that Malala can ’ t see ,  ’ my father told him in distress . 
 ‘ That ’ s nonsense ,  ’ he replied .  ‘ If she can read and write , how can she not see ? Dr Fiona has kept
me updated , and one of the first notes Malala wrote was to ask about you .  ’ 
Far away in Birmingham , not only could I see but I was asking for a mirror .  ‘ Mirror ,  ’ I wrote in the
pink diary – I wanted to see my face and hair . The nurses brought me a small white mirror which I
still have . When I saw myself , I was distraught . My long hair , which I used to spend ages styling , had
gone , and the left side of my head had none at all .  ‘ Now my hair is small ,  ’ I wrote in the book . I
thought the Taliban had cut it off . In fact the Pakistani doctors had shaved my head with no mercy . My
face was distorted like someone had pulled it down on one side , and there was a scar to the side of
my left eye . 
 ‘ Hwo did this to me ?  ’ I wrote , my letters still scrambled .  ‘ What happened to me ?  ’ 
I also wrote ‘ Stop lights ’ as the bright lights were making my head ache . 
 ‘ Something bad happened to you ,  ’ said Dr Fiona . 
 ‘ Was I shot ? Was my father shot ?  ’ I wrote . 
She told me that I had been shot on the school bus . She said two of my friends on the bus had also
been shot , but I didn ’ t recognise their names . She explained that the bullet had entered through the side
of my left eye where there was a scar , travelled eighteen inches down to my left shoulder and stopped
there . It could have taken out my eye or gone into my brain . It was a miracle I was alive . 
I felt nothing , maybe just a bit satisfied .  ‘ So they did it .  ’ My only regret was that I hadn ’ t had a
chance to speak to them before they shot me . Now they ’ d never hear what I had to say . I didn ’ t even
think a single bad thought about the man who shot me – I had no thoughts of revenge – I just wanted to
go back to Swat . I wanted to go home . 
After that images started to swim around in my head but I wasn ’ t sure what was a dream and what
was reality . The story I remember of being shot is quite different from what really happened . I was in
another school bus with my father and friends and another girl called Gul . We were on our way home
when suddenly two Taliban appeared dressed in black . One of them put a gun to my head and the
small bullet that came out of it entered my body . In this dream he also shot my father . Then everything
is dark , I ’ m lying on a stretcher and there is a crowd of men , a lot of men , and my eyes are searching
for my father . Finally I see him and try to talk to him but I can ’ t get the words out . Other times I am in
a lot of places , in Jinnah Market in Islamabad , in Cheena Bazaar , and I am shot . I even dreamed that
the doctors were Taliban . 
As I grew more alert , I wanted more details . People coming in were not allowed to bring their
phones , but Dr Fiona always had her iPhone with her because she is an emergency doctor . When she
put it down , I grabbed it to search for my name on Google . It was hard as my double vision meant I
kept typing in the wrong letters . I also wanted to check my email , but I couldn ’ t remember the
password . 
On the fifth day I got my voice back but it sounded like someone else . When Rehanna came in we
talked about the shooting from an Islamic perspective .  ‘ They shot at me ,  ’ I told her . 
 ‘ Yes , that ’ s right ,  ’ she replied .  ‘ Too many people in the Muslim world can ’ t believe a Muslim can
do such a thing ,  ’ she said .  ‘ My mother , for example , would say they can ’ t be Muslims . Some people
call themselves Muslims but their actions are not Islamic .  ’ We talked about how things happen for
different reasons , this happened to me , and how education for females not just males is one of our
Islamic rights . I was speaking up for my right as a Muslim woman to be able to go to school .  
* 
Once I got my voice back , I talked to my parents on Dr Javid ’ s phone . I was worried about sounding
strange .  ‘ Do I sound different ?  ’ I asked my father . 
 ‘ No ,  ’ he said .  ‘ You sound the same and your voice will only get better . Are you OK ?  ’ he asked . 
 ‘ Yes ,  ’ I replied ,  ‘ but this headache is so severe , I can ’ t bear the pain .  ’ 
My father got really worried . I think he ended up with a bigger headache than me . In all the calls
after that he would ask ,  ‘ Is the headache increasing or decreasing ?  ’ 
After that I just said to him ,  ‘ I ’ m OK .  ’ I didn ’ t want to upset him and didn ’ t complain even when
they took the staples from my head and gave me big injections in my neck .  ‘ When are you coming ?  ’ I
kept asking . 
By then they had been stuck in the army hostel at the hospital in Rawalpindi for a week with no
news about when they might come to Birmingham . My mother was so desperate that she told my
father ,  ‘ If there is no news by tomorrow I will go on a hunger strike .  ’ Later that day my father went to
see the major in charge of security and told him . The major looked alarmed . Within ten minutes my
father was told arrangements would be made for them to move to Islamabad later that day . Surely
there they could arrange everything ? 
When my father returned to my mother he said to her ,  ‘ You are a great woman . All along I thought
Malala and I were the campaigners but you really know how to protest !  ’ 
They were moved to Kashmir House in Islamabad , a hostel for members of parliament . Security
was still so tight that when my father asked for a barber to give him a shave , a policeman sat with
them all the way through so the man wouldn ’ t cut his throat . 
At least now they had their phones back and we could speak more easily . Each time , Dr Javid
would call my father in advance to tell him what time he could speak to me and to make sure he was
free . But when the doctor called the line was usually busy . My father is always on the phone ! I rattled
off my mother ’ s eleven-digit mobile number and Dr Javid looked astonished . He knew then that my
memory was fine . But my parents were still in darkness about why they weren ’ t flying to me . Dr Javid
was also baffled as to why they weren ’ t coming . When they said they didn ’ t know , he made a call and
then assured them the problem was not with the army but the civilian government . 
Later they would discover that , rather than do whatever it took to get my parents on the first plane
to Birmingham to join their sick daughter , the interior minister Rehman Malik was hoping to fly with
them so they could have a joint press conference at the hospital , and it was taking some time to make
the arrangements . He also wanted to make sure they didn ’ t ask for political asylum in Britain , which
would be embarrassing for his government . Eventually he asked my parents outright if this was their
plan . It was funny because my mother had no idea what asylum was and my father had never even
thought about it – there were other things on his mind . 
When my parents moved to Kashmir House they were visited by Sonia Shahid , the mother of Shiza , 
our friend who had arranged the trip to Islamabad for all us Khushal School girls . She had assumed
they had gone to the UK with me , and when she found out they were still in Pakistan , she was
horrified . They said they had been told there were no plane tickets to Birmingham . Sonia brought them
clothes as they had left everything in Swat and got my father the number for President Zardari ’ s office . 
He called and left a message . That night the president spoke to him and promised everything would be
sorted out .  ‘ I know what it ’ s like to be kept from one ’ s children ,  ’ he said , referring to his years in jail . 
When I heard they would be in Birmingham in two days I had one request .  ‘ Bring my school bag ,  ’ I
pleaded to my father .  ‘ If you can ’ t go to Swat to fetch it , no matter – buy new books for me because in
March it ’ s my board examination .  ’ Of course I wanted to come first in class . I especially wanted my
physics book because physics is difficult for me , and I needed to practise numericals as my maths is
not so good and they are hard for me to solve . 
I thought I ’ d be back home by November . 
It ended up being ten days before my parents came . Those ten days I spent in hospital without them
felt like a hundred days . It was boring and I wasn ’ t sleeping well . I stared at the clock in my room . 
The changing time reassured me I was alive and I saw for the first time in my life that I was waking
early . Every morning I longed for 7 a . m . when the nurses would come . The nurses and Dr Fiona
played games with me . QEH is not a children ’ s hospital so they brought over a play coordinator with
games . One of my favourites was Connect 4 . I usually drew with Dr Fiona but I could beat everyone
else . The nurses and hospital staff felt sorry for me in a far-off land away from my family and were
very kind , particularly Yma Choudhury , the jolly director of operations , and Julie Tracy , the head
nurse , who would sit and hold my hand . 
The only thing I had with me from Pakistan was a beige shawl which Colonel Junaid had given to
Dr Fiona as a present for me so they went clothes shopping to buy me things . They had no idea how
conservative I was or what a teenage girl from the Swat Valley would wear . They went to Next and
British Home Stores and came back with bags of T-shirts , pyjamas , socks and even bras . Yma asked
me if I would like shalwar kamiz and I nodded .  ‘ What ’ s your favourite colour ?  ’ she asked . Pink was , 
of course , my reply . 
They were worried I wasn ’ t eating . But I didn ’ t like the hospital food and I was worried it was not
halal . The only things I ’ d eat there were the nutritional milkshakes . Nurse Julie discovered I liked
Cheesy Wotsits so brought me those .  ‘ What do you like ?  ’ they asked me .  ‘ Fried chicken ,  ’ I replied . 
Yma discovered there was a halal Kentucky Fried Chicken at Small Heath so would go there every
afternoon to buy me chicken and chips . One day she even cooked me a curry . 
To keep me occupied they brought me a DVD player . One of the first movies they got me was Bend
it Like Beckham , thinking the story of a Sikh girl challenging her cultural norms and playing football
would appeal to me . I was shocked when the girls took off their shirts to practise in sports bras and I
made the nurses switch it off . After that they brought cartoons and Disney movies . I watched all three
Shrek movies and A Shark ’ s Tale . My left eye was still blurry so I covered it when I watched , and my
left ear would bleed so I had to keep putting in cotton-wool balls . One day I asked a nurse ,  ‘ What is
this lump ?  ’ placing her hand on my tummy . My stomach was big and hard and I didn ’ t know why . 
 ‘ It ’ s the top of your skull ,  ’ she replied . I was shocked . 
After I started to speak I also walked again for the first time . I hadn ’ t felt any problem with my
arms or legs in bed apart from my left hand which was stiff because the bullet had ended up by my
shoulder so I didn ’ t realise I couldn ’ t walk properly . My first few steps were such hard work it felt
like I ’ d run a hundred kilometres . The doctors told me I would be fine ; I just needed lots of
physiotherapy to get my muscles working again . 
One day another Fiona came , Fiona Alexander , who told me she was in charge of the hospital press
office . I thought this was funny . I couldn ’ t imagine Swat Central Hospital having a press office . Until
she came I had no idea of the attention I ’ d attracted . When I was flown from Pakistan there was
supposed to be a news blackout , but photographs were leaked from Pakistan of me leaving and saying
I was going to the UK , and the media soon found out my destination was Birmingham . A Sky News
helicopter was soon circling above , and as many as 250 journalists came to the hospital from as far
away as Australia and Japan . Fiona Alexander had spent twenty years as a journalist herself , and had
been editor of the Birmingham Post , so she knew exactly how to feed them material and stop them
trying to get in . The hospital started giving daily news briefings on my condition . 
People just turned up wanting to see me – government ministers , diplomats , politicians , even an
envoy from the Archbishop of Canterbury . Most brought bouquets , some of them exquisitely beautiful . 
One day Fiona Alexander brought me a bag of cards and toys and pictures . It was Eid ul-Azha ,  ‘ Big
Eid ’  , our main religious holiday , so I thought maybe some Muslims had sent them . Then I saw the
postage dates , from 10 October , 11 October , days before , and I realised it was nothing to do with Eid . 
They were from people all over the world wishing me a speedy recovery , many of them
schoolchildren . I was astonished and Fiona laughed .  ‘ You haven ’ t seen anything yet .  ’ She told me
there were sacks and sacks more , about 8 , 000 cards in total , many just addressed ,  ‘ Malala , 
Birmingham Hospital ’  . One was even addressed ,  ‘ The Girl Shot in the Head , Birmingham ’  , yet it had
got there . There were offers to adopt me as if I had no family and even a marriage proposal . 
Rehanna told me that thousands and millions of people and children around the world had
supported me and prayed for me . Then I realised that people had saved my life . I had been spared for
a reason . People had sent other presents too . There were boxes and boxes of chocolates and teddy
bears of every shape and size . Most precious of all perhaps was the parcel that came from Benazir
Bhutto ’ s children Bilawal and Bakhtawar . Inside were two shawls that had belonged to their late
mother . I buried my nose in them to try and smell her perfume . Later I found a long black hair on one
of them , which made it even more special . 
I realised what the Taliban had done was make my campaign global . While I was lying in that bed
waiting to take my first steps in a new world , Gordon Brown , the UN special envoy for education and
former prime minister of Britain , had launched a petition under the slogan ‘ I am Malala ’ to demand no
child be denied schooling by 2015 . There were messages from heads of state and ministers and movie
stars and one from the granddaughter of Sir Olaf Caroe , the last British governor of our province . She
said she was ashamed at not being able to read and write Pashto although her grandfather had been
fluent . Beyoncé had written me a card and posted a photo of it on Facebook , Selena Gomez had
tweeted about me and Madonna had dedicated a song . There was even a message from my favourite
actress and social activist , Angelina Jolie – I couldn ’ t wait to tell Moniba . 
I didn ’ t realise then I wouldn ’ t be going home .

 ‘ They have snatched her smile ’ 
THE DAY MY parents flew to Birmingham I was moved out of intensive care and into room 4 , ward
519 , which had windows so I could look out and see England for the first time .  ‘ Where are the
mountains ?  ’ I asked . It was misty and rainy so I thought maybe they were hidden . I didn ’ t know then
that this was a land of little sun . All I could see were houses and streets . The houses were red brick
and all looked exactly the same . Everything looked very calm and organised , and it was odd to see
people ’ s lives going on as if nothing had happened . 
Dr Javid told me my parents were coming and tilted my bed so that I was sitting up to greet them
when they arrived . I was so excited . In the sixteen days since that morning when I had run out of our
house in Mingora shouting goodbye , I had been in four hospitals and travelled thousands of miles . It
felt like sixteen years . Then the door opened and there were the familiar voices saying ‘ Jani ’ and
 ‘ Pisho ’  , and they were there , kissing my hands as they were frightened to touch me . 
I couldn ’ t control myself and wept as loudly as I could . All that time alone in hospital I hadn ’ t
cried even when I had all those injections in my neck or the staples removed from my head . But now I
could not stop . My father and mother were also weeping . It was as if all the weight had been lifted
from my heart . I felt that everything would be fine now . I was even happy to see my brother Khushal , 
as I needed someone to fight with .  ‘ We missed you Malala ’  , said my brothers , though they were soon
more interested in all the teddies and gifts . And Khushal and I were soon fighting again when he took
my laptop to play games on . 
I was shocked by my parents ’ appearance . They were tired from the long flight from Pakistan but
that wasn ’ t all – they looked older and I could see they both had grey hairs . They tried to hide it , but I
could see they were also disturbed by how I looked . Before they came in , Dr Javid had warned them , 
 ‘ The girl you will see is only ten per cent recovered ; there is still ninety per cent to go .  ’ But they had
no idea that half my face was not working and that I couldn ’ t smile . My left eye bulged , half my hair
was gone and my mouth tilted to one side as if it had been pulled down so when I tried to smile it
looked more like a grimace . It was as if my brain had forgotten it had a left face . I also couldn ’ t hear
from one side , and I spoke in baby language as if I was a small child . 
My parents were put in a hostel in the university among all the students . The people in charge of the
hospital thought it might be difficult for them to stay at the hospital because they would be besieged by
journalists , and they wanted to protect us at this critical stage in my recovery . My parents had very
little with them except the clothes they were wearing and what Shiza ’ s mother Sonia had given them
because when they left Swat on 9 October they had no idea they wouldn ’ t be going back . When they
returned to the hostel room , they cried like children . I had always been such a happy child . My father
would boast to people about ‘ my heavenly smile and heavenly laughter ’  . Now he lamented to my
mother ,  ‘ That beautiful symmetrical face , that bright shining face has gone ; she has lost her smile and
laughter . The Taliban are very cruel – they have snatched her smile ,  ’ he added .  ‘ You can give
someone eyes or lungs but you cannot restore their smile .  ’ 
The problem was a facial nerve . The doctors were not sure at that point if it was damaged and
might repair itself , or if it was cut . I reassured my mother that it didn ’ t matter to me if my face was not
symmetrical . Me , who had always cared about my appearance , how my hair looked ! But when you
see death , things change .  ‘ It doesn ’ t matter if I can ’ t smile or blink properly ,  ’ I told her ,  ‘ I ’ m still me , 
Malala . The important thing is God has given me my life .  ’ Yet every time they came to the hospital
and I laughed or tried to smile , my mother ’ s face would darken as if a shadow had crossed it . It was
like a reverse mirror – when there was laughter on my face there was distress on my mother ’ s . 
My father would look towards my mother , who had this big question in her eyes : Why was Malala
like this ? The girl she had brought into the world and for fifteen years had been smiling . One day my
father asked her ,  ‘ Pekai , tell me truthfully . What do you think – is it my fault ?  ’ 
 ‘ No , Khaista ,  ’ she replied .  ‘ You didn ’ t send Malala out thieving or killing or to commit crimes . It
was a noble cause .  ’ 
Even so , my father worried that in future every time I smiled it would be a reminder of the
shooting . That was not the only way they found me changed . Back in Swat I used to be a very fragile
and sensitive child who would cry at the slightest thing , but in hospital in Birmingham even when I
was in terrible pain I did not complain . 
The hospital refused to allow other visitors even though they were inundated by requests , as they
wanted me to be able to concentrate on my rehabilitation in private . Four days after my parents
arrived a group of politicians came to the hospital from the three countries that had helped me –
Rehman Malik , Pakistan ’ s interior minister , William Hague , the British foreign minister and Sheikh
Abdullah bin Zayed , foreign minister of the UAE . They were not allowed to see me but were briefed
by doctors and met my father . He was upset by the ministers ’ visit because Rehman Malik said to him , 
 ‘ Tell Malala she should give a smile to the nation .  ’ He did not know that that was the one thing I
could not do . 
Rehman Malik had revealed that my attacker was a talib called Ataullah Khan who he said had
been arrested in 2009 during the military operation in Swat but freed after three months . There were
media reports that he had done a physics degree at Jehanzeb College . Malik claimed the plan to shoot
me was hatched in Afghanistan . He said he had put a $1 million bounty on the head of Ataullah and
promised they would find him . We doubted that , as no one has ever been caught – not the killer of
Benazir Bhutto , not whoever was behind the plane crash that killed General Zia , not the assassin of
our first prime minister , Liaquat Ali Khan . 
Only two people had been arrested after my shooting – our poor dear driver Usman Bhai Jan and
the school accountant , who had taken the call from Usman Bhai Jan to say what had happened . He was
released after a few days but Usman Bhai Jan was still in army custody as they said they would need
him to identify people . We were very upset about that . Why had they arrested Usman Bhai Jan and not
Ataullah ? 
The United Nations announced they were designating 10 November , one month and a day after the
shooting , Malala Day . I didn ’ t pay much attention as I was preparing for a big operation the following
day to repair my facial nerve . The doctors had done tests with electrical impulses and it had not
responded , so they concluded it was cut and they needed to operate soon or my face would remain
paralysed . The hospital had been giving regular updates to journalists about how I was doing but did
not tell them about this to keep it private . 
I was taken into theatre on 11 November for a surgeon called Richard Irving to carry out the
operation . He had explained to me that this nerve controlled the side of my face , and its job was to
open and close my left eye , move my nose , raise my left eyebrow and make me smile . Repairing the
nerve was such delicate work that it took eight and a half hours . The surgeon first cleared my ear
canal of scar tissue and bone fragments and discovered that my left eardrum was damaged . Then he
followed the facial nerve from the temporal bone where it enters the skull all the way to its exit , and
on the way removed many more fragments of bone which had been restricting my jaw movement . He
found two centimetres of my nerve completely missing where it leaves the skull and rerouted it in
front of my ear from its normal passage behind the ear , to make up for the gap . 
The operation went well , though it was a three-month wait before the left side of my face started
working bit by bit . I had to do facial exercises every day in front of my small mirror . Mr Irving told
me that after six months the nerve would start working though I would never be completely the same . 
To my delight I could soon smile and wink my eye , and week by week my parents saw more
movement coming into my face . Though it was my face , I could see it was my parents who were
happiest to have it back . Afterwards Mr Irving said it was the best outcome he had seen in twenty
years of facial nerve surgery , and it was 86 per cent recovered . 
The other good result was that finally my headaches lifted and I started reading again . I began with
The Wonderful Wizard of Oz , one of a pile of books sent to me by Gordon Brown . I loved reading
about Dorothy and how even though she was trying to get back home she stopped and helped those in
need like the cowardly lion and the rusty tin man . She had to overcome a lot of obstacles to get where
she was going , and I thought if you want to achieve a goal , there will be hurdles in your way but you
must continue . I was so excited by the book that I read it quickly and afterwards told my father all
about it . He was very happy because he thought if I could memorise and narrate such detail then my
memory must be fine . 
I knew my parents were worried about my memory as I told them I didn ’ t remember anything about
the shooting and kept forgetting the names of my friends . They weren ’ t very subtle . One day my father
asked ,  ‘ Malala , can you sing us some Pashto tapey ?  ’ I sang a verse we liked :  ‘ When you start your
journey from the end of a snake ’ s tail ,  / You will end up on its head in an ocean of poison .  ’ To us that
referred to how the authorities in Pakistan had initially used the militants and now were in a mess of
their own making . Then I said ,  ‘ Actually there ’ s a tapa I want to rewrite .  ’ 
My father looked intrigued . Tapey are the centuries-old collected wisdom of our society ; you don ’ t
change them .  ‘ Which one ?  ’ he asked . 
 ‘ This one ,  ’ I said . 
If the men cannot win the battle , O my country , 
Then the women will come forth and win you an honour . 
I wanted to change it to : 
Whether the men are winning or losing the battle , O my country , 
The women are coming and the women will win you an honour . 
He laughed and repeated the story to everyone , as he always does . 
I worked hard in the gym and with the physiotherapist to get my arms and legs working properly
again and was rewarded on 6 December with my first trip out of the hospital . I told Yma that I loved
nature so she arranged for two staff to take me and my mother on an outing to the Birmingham
Botanical Gardens , not far from the hospital . They didn ’ t let my father come as they thought he would
be recognised , having been in the media a lot . Even so I was very happy , my first time back in the
outside world , seeing Birmingham and England . 
They told me to sit in the back of the car in the middle , not next to a window , which was annoying
as I wanted to see everything in this new country . I didn ’ t realise they were trying to protect my head
from any bump . When we entered the gardens and I saw all the green plants and trees , it was a
powerful reminder of home . I kept saying ,  ‘ This one is in my valley ,  ’ and ,  ‘ We also have this one .  ’ I
am very proud of the beautiful plants of my valley . It was odd seeing all the other visitors , for whom
it was just a normal day out . I felt like Dorothy at the end of her journey . My mother was so excited
she called my father .  ‘ For the first time I am happy ,  ’ she said . But it was ice cold and so we went into
the café and had delicious tea and cakes , something called a ‘ cream tea ’  . 
Two days after that I had my first visitor from outside the family – the president of Pakistan , Asif
Zardari . The hospital did not want him to come as they knew it would mean a media frenzy , but it was
difficult for my father to refuse . Not only was Mr Zardari our head of state but he had said the
government would pay all my medical bills , which would end up being around £200 , 000 . They had
also rented an apartment for my parents in the centre of Birmingham so they could move out of the
hostel . The visit was on Saturday , 8 December , and the whole thing was like something out of a James
Bond movie . 
There were a lot of journalists gathered outside from early on , who naturally assumed the president
would be brought to me in the hospital . Instead I was wrapped up in a big purple parka with a hood , 
taken down through the staff entrance and driven to the hospital offices . We drove right past
journalists and photographers , some of whom were up in trees , and they did not even notice . Then I
sat and waited in an office , playing a game called Elf Bowling on the computer and beating my
brother Atal even though it was the first time I had played it . When Zardari and his party arrived in
two cars they were brought in through the back . He came with about ten people including his chief of
staff , his military secretary and the Pakistan High Commissioner in London , who had taken over from
Dr Fiona as my official guardian in the UK till my parents arrived . 
The president was first briefed by doctors not to mention my face . Then he came in to see me with
his youngest daughter Asifa , who is a few years older than me . They brought me a bouquet of flowers . 
He touched my head , which is our tradition , but my father was worried as I had nothing but skin , no
bone to protect my brain , and my head beneath the shawl was concave . Afterwards the president sat
with my father , who told him that we were fortunate I had been brought to the UK .  ‘ She might have
survived in Pakistan but she wouldn ’ t have had the rehabilitation and would have been disfigured ,  ’ he
said .  ‘ Now her smile will return .  ’ 
Mr Zardari told the high commissioner to give my father a post as education attaché so he would
have a salary to live on and a diplomatic passport so he would not need to seek asylum to stay in the
UK . My father was relieved as he was wondering how he would pay for things . Gordon Brown , in his
UN role , had also asked him to be his adviser , an unpaid position , and the president said that was
fine ; he could be both . After the meeting Mr Zardari described me to the media as ‘ a remarkable girl
and a credit to Pakistan ’  . But still not everyone in Pakistan was so positive . Though my father had
tried to keep it from me I knew some people were saying he had shot me , or that I wasn ’ t shot at all , 
and we had staged it so we could live overseas . 
The new year of 2013 was a happy one when I was discharged from hospital in early January
finally to live with my family again . The Pakistan High Commission had rented two serviced
apartments for us in a building in a modern square in the centre of Birmingham . The apartments were
on the tenth floor , which was higher than any of us had ever been before . I teased my mother , as after
the earthquake when we were in a three-storey building she said she would never again live in an
apartment block . My father told me that when they arrived she had been so scared that she had said ,  ‘ I
will die in this lift !  ’ 
We were so happy to be a family again . My brother Khushal was as annoying as always . The boys
were bored cooped up waiting for me to recover , away from school and their friends , though Atal
was excited by everything new . I quickly realised I could treat them how I liked and I wouldn ’ t get
told off . It was a cold winter , and as I watched the snow falling outside through the big glass
windows I wished I could run around and chase the snowflakes like we used to back home . 
Sometimes we went for walks to build up my strength though I tired easily . 
In the square was a fountain and a Costa coffee bar with glass walls through which you could see
men and women chatting and mixing in a way that would be unthinkable in Swat . The apartment was
just off Broad Street , a famous road of shops , night clubs and stripbars . We went to the shops though I
still did not like shopping . At nights our eyes were all out on stalks at the skimpy clothes that women
wore – tiny shorts almost like knickers and bare legs on the highest heels even in the middle of
winter . My mother was so horrified that she cried ,  ‘ Gharqa shoma !  ’ – ‘ I ’ m drowning ’ – and begged
my father ,  ‘ Please take me to Dubai . I can ’ t live here !  ’ Later we laughed about it .  ‘ Are their legs
made of iron so they don ’ t feel cold ?  ’ asked my mother . 
We were warned not to be out late on Broad Street on weekend nights as it could be dangerous . 
This made us laugh . How could it be unsafe compared to where we had come from ? Were there
Taliban beheading people ? I didn ’ t tell my parents but I flinched if an Asian-looking man came close . 
I thought everyone had a gun . 
Once a week I Skyped my friends back in Mingora , and they told me they were still keeping a seat
in class for me . The teacher had brought to class my Pakistan Studies exam from that day , the day of
the shooting . I had got 75 out of 75 , but as I never did the others , Malka-e-Noor got first in class . 
Though I had been getting some schooling at the hospital , I worried that I was falling behind . Now the
competition was between Malka-e-Noor and Moniba .  ‘ It ’ s boring without you to compete with ,  ’ 
Malka-e-Noor told me . 
I was getting stronger every day , but my surgery wasn ’ t over . I still had the top of my skull missing . 
The doctors were also concerned about my hearing . When I went for walks I could not understand the
words of my mother and father in a crowd . And inside my ear was a tinny noise which only I could
hear . On Saturday , 2 February I was back in QEH to be operated on – this time by a woman . Her
name was Anwen White . First she removed the skull bone from my tummy , but after looking at it
decided not to put it back as it had not kept well and there was a risk of infection . Instead she did
something called a titanium cranioplasty ( I now know lots of medical terms !  ) and fitted a specially
moulded titanium plate in my head with eight screws to do the job of a skull and protect my brain . 
While I was in surgery Mr Irving , the surgeon who had repaired my nerve , also had a solution for
my damaged left eardrum . He put a small electronic device called a cochlear implant inside my head
near the ear and told me that in a month they would fit the external part on my head , and then I should
be able to hear . I was in theatre five hours and I ’ d had three operations , but I didn ’ t feel like I ’ d had
major surgery and was back in the apartment within five days . A few weeks later when the receiver
was fitted behind my ear , my left ear heard beep beep for the first time . To start with , everything was
like a robot sound , but soon it was getting better and better . 
We human beings don ’ t realise how great God is . He has given us an extraordinary brain and a
sensitive loving heart . He has blessed us with two lips to talk and express our feelings , two eyes
which see a world of colours and beauty , two feet which walk on the road of life , two hands to work
for us , a nose which smells the beauty of fragrance , and two ears to hear the words of love . As I found
with my ear , no one knows how much power they have in their each and every organ until they lose
one . 
I thank Allah for the hard-working doctors , for my recovery and for sending us to this world where
we may struggle for our survival . Some people choose good ways and some choose bad ways . One
person ’ s bullet hit me . It swelled my brain , stole my hearing and cut the nerve of the left side of my
face in the space of a second . And after that one second there were millions of people praying for my
life and talented doctors who gave me my own body back . I was a good girl . In my heart I had only
the desire to help people . It wasn ’ t about the awards or the money . I always prayed to God ,  ‘ I want to
help people and please help me to do that .  ’ 
A talib fires three shots at point-blank range at three girls in a van and doesn ’ t kill any of them . 
This seems an unlikely story , and people say I have made a miraculous recovery . My friend Shazia , 
who was hit twice , was offered a scholarship at Atlantic College in Wales so has also come to the
UK for schooling , and I hope Kainat will too . I know God stopped me from going to the grave . It feels
like this life is a second life . People prayed to God to spare me , and I was spared for a reason – to
use my life for helping people . When people talk about the way I was shot and what happened I think
it ’ s the story of Malala ,  ‘ a girl shot by the Taliban ’  ; I don ’ t feel it ’ s a story about me at all . 
EPILOGUE
One Child , One Teacher , One Book , One Pen .  .  . 
Birmingham , August 2013
IN MARCH WE moved from the apartment to a rented house on a leafy street , but it feels as if we are
camping in it . All our belongings are still in Swat . Everywhere there are cardboard boxes full of the
kind letters and cards that people send , and in one room stands a piano none of us can play . My
mother complains about the murals of Greek gods on the walls and carved cherubs on the ceilings
watching her . 
Our house feels big and empty . It sits behind an electric iron gate and it sometimes seems as if we
are in what we in Pakistan call a sub-jail , a kind of luxury house arrest . At the back there is a large
garden with lots of trees and a green lawn for me and my brothers to play cricket on . But there are no
rooftops to play on , no children fighting with kites in the streets , no neighbours coming in to borrow a
plate of rice or for us to ask for three tomatoes . We are just a wall ’ s distance from the next house but
it feels miles away . 
If I look out , I see my mother wandering around the garden , her head covered by a shawl , feeding
the birds . She looks as if she is singing , maybe that tapa she likes :  ‘ Don ’ t kill doves in the garden .  / 
You kill one and the others won ’ t come .  ’ She is giving the birds the remains of our dinner from the
night before and there are tears in her eyes . We eat much the same here as we did back home – rice
and meat for lunch and dinner , while breakfast is fried eggs , chapatis and sometimes also honey , a
tradition started by my little brother Atal , though his favourite Birmingham discovery is Nutella
sandwiches . But there are always leftovers . My mother is sad about the waste of food . I know she is
remembering all the children we fed in our house , so they would not go to school on empty stomachs , 
and wondering how they are faring now . 
When I came home from school in Mingora I never found my house without people in it ; now I
can ’ t believe that I used to plead for a day of peace and some privacy to do my school work . Here the
only sound is of the birds and Khushal ’ s Xbox . I sit alone in my room doing a jigsaw puzzle and long
for guests . 
We didn ’ t have much money and my parents knew what it was like to be hungry . My mother never
turned anyone away . Once a poor woman came , hot , hungry and thirsty , to our door . My mother let her
in and gave her food and the woman was so happy .  ‘ I touched every door in the mohalla and this was
the only one open ,  ’ she said .  ‘ May God always keep your door open , wherever you are .  ’ 
I know my mother is lonely . She was very sociable – all the women of the neighbourhood used to
gather in the afternoons on our back porch and women who worked in other houses came to rest . Now
she is always on the phone to everyone back home . It ’ s hard for her here as she does not speak any
English . Our house has all these facilities , but when she arrived they were all mysteries to her and
someone had to show us how to use the oven , washing machine and the TV . 
As usual my father doesn ’ t help in the kitchen . I tease him ,  ‘ Aba , you talk of women ’ s rights , but my
mother manages everything ! You don ’ t even clear the tea things .  ’ 
There are buses and trains but we are unsure about using them . My mother misses going shopping in
Cheena Bazaar . She is happier since my cousin Shah came to stay . He has a car and takes her
shopping , but it ’ s not the same as she can ’ t talk to her friends and neighbours about what she bought . 
A door bangs in the house and my mother jumps – she jumps these days at the slightest noise . She
often cries then hugs me ’  .  ‘ Malala is alive ,  ’ she says . Now she treats me as if I was her youngest
rather than eldest child . 
I know my father cries too . He cries when I push my hair to the side and he sees the scar on my
head , and he cries when he wakes from an afternoon nap to hear his children ’ s voices in the garden
and realises with relief that one of them is still mine . He knows people say it ’ s his fault that I was
shot , that he pushed me to speak up like a tennis dad trying to create a champion , as if I don ’ t have my
own mind . It ’ s hard for him . All he worked for for over almost twenty years has been left behind : the
school he built up from nothing , which now has three buildings with 1 , 100 pupils and seventy
teachers . I know he felt proud at what he had created , a poor boy from that narrow village between
the Black and White Mountains . He says ,  ‘ It ’ s as if you planted a tree and nurtured it – you have the
right to sit in its shade .  ’ 
His dream in life was to have a very big school in Swat providing quality education , to live
peacefully and to have democracy in our country . In Swat he had achieved respect and status in
society through his activities and the help he gave people . He never imagined living abroad and he
gets upset when people suggest we wanted to come to the UK .  ‘ A person who has eighteen years of
education , a nice life , a family , you throw him out just as you throw a fish out of water for speaking up
for girls ’ education ?  ’ Sometimes he says we have gone from being IDPs to EDPs – externally
displaced persons . Often over meals we talk about home and try to remember things . We miss
everything , even the smelly stream . My father says ,  ‘ If I had known this would happen , I would have
looked back for a last time just as the Prophet did when he left Mecca to migrate to Medina . He
looked back again and again .  ’ Already some of the things from Swat seem like stories from a distant
place , like somewhere I have read about . 
My father spends much of his time going to conferences on education . I know it ’ s odd for him that
now people want to hear him because of me , not the other way round . I used to be known as his
daughter ; now he ’ s known as my father . When he went to France to collect an award for me he told
the audience ,  ‘ In my part of the world most people are known by their sons . I am one of the few lucky
fathers known by his daughter .  ’ 
A smart new uniform hangs on my bedroom door , bottle green instead of royal blue , for a school
where no one dreams of being attacked for going to classes or someone blowing up the building . In
April I was well enough to start school in Birmingham . It ’ s wonderful going to school and not having
to feel scared as I did in Mingora , always looking around me on my way to school , terrified a talib
would jump out . 
It ’ s a good school . Many subjects are the same as at home , but the teachers have PowerPoint and
computers rather than chalk and blackboards . We have some different subjects – music , art , computer
studies , home economics , where we learn to cook – and we do practicals in science , which is rare in
Pakistan . Even though I recently got just forty percent in my physics exam , it is still my favourite
subject . I love learning about Newton and the basic principles the whole universe obeys . 
But like my mother I am lonely . It takes time to make good friends like I had at home , and the girls
at school here treat me differently . People say ,  ‘ Oh , that ’ s Malala ’ – they see me as ‘ Malala , girls ’ 
rights activist ’  . Back in the Khushal School I was just Malala , the same double-jointed girl they had
always known , who loved to tell jokes and drew pictures to explain things . Oh , and who was always
quarrelling with her brother and best friend ! I think every class has a very well behaved girl , a very
intelligent or genius girl , a very popular girl , a beautiful girl , a girl who is a bit shy , a notorious girl .  
.  . but here I haven ’ t worked out yet who is who . 
As there is no one here I can tell my jokes to , I save them and tell them to Moniba when we Skype . 
My first question is always ,  ‘ What ’ s the latest news at the school ?  ’ I love to hear who is fighting with
who , and who got told off by which teacher . Moniba came first in class in the most recent exams . My
classmates still keep the seat for me with my name on it , and at the boys ’ school Sir Amjad has put a
big poster of me at the entrance and says he greets it every morning before going into his office . 
I describe life in England to Moniba . I tell her of the streets with rows of identical houses , unlike
home , where everything is different and higgledy-piggledy and a shack of mud and stones can stand
next to a house as big as a castle . I tell her how they are lovely solid houses which could withstand
floods and earthquakes but have no flat roofs to play on . I tell her I like England because people
follow rules , they respect policemen and everything happens on time . The government is in charge
and no one needs to know the name of the army chief . I see women having jobs we couldn ’ t imagine
in Swat . They are police and security guards ; they run big companies and dress exactly as they like . 
I don ’ t often think about the shooting , though every day when I look in the mirror it is a reminder . The
nerve operation has done as much as it can . I will never be exactly the same . I can ’ t blink fully and my
left eye closes a lot when I speak . My father ’ s friend Hidayatullah told him we should be proud of my
eye .  ‘ It ’ s the beauty of her sacrifice ,  ’ he said . 
It is still not definitely known who shot me , but a man named Ataullah Khan said he did it . The
police have not managed to find him but they say they are investigating and want to interview me . 
Though I don ’ t remember exactly what happened that day , sometimes I have flashbacks . They come
unexpectedly . The worst one was in June , when we were in Abu Dhabi on the way to perform Umrah
in Saudi Arabia . I went to a shopping mall with my mother as she wanted to buy a special burqa to
pray in Mecca . I didn ’ t want one . I said I would just wear my shawl as it is not specified that a
woman must wear a burqa . As we were walking through the mall , suddenly I could see so many men
around me . I thought they were waiting for me with guns and would shoot . I was terrified though I said
nothing . I told myself , Malala , you have already faced death . This is your second life . Don ’ t be
afraid – if you are afraid you can ’ t move forward . 
We believe that when we have our first sight of the Kaaba , the black-shrouded cube in Mecca that
is our most sacred place , any wish in your heart is granted by God . When we prayed at the Kaaba , we
prayed for peace in Pakistan and for girls ’ education , and I was surprised to find myself in tears . But
when we went to the other holy places in the desert of Mecca where the Prophet lived and preached , I
was shocked that they were littered with empty bottles and biscuit wrappers . It seemed that people
had neglected to preserve history . I thought they had forgotten the Hadith that cleanliness is half of
faith . 
My world has changed so much . On the shelves of our rented living room are awards from around the
world – America , India , France , Spain , Italy and Austria , and many other places . I ’ ve even been
nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize , the youngest person ever . When I received prizes for my work
at school I was happy as I had worked hard for them , but these prizes are different . I am grateful for
them , but they only remind me how much work still needs to be done to achieve the goal of education
for every boy and girl . I don ’ t want to be thought of as ‘ the girl who was shot by the Taliban ’ but ‘ the
girl who fought for education ’  . This is the cause to which I want to devote my life . 
On my sixteenth birthday I was in New York to speak at the United Nations . Standing up to address
an audience inside the vast hall where so many world leaders have spoken before was daunting , but I
knew what I wanted to say .  ‘ This is your chance Malala ,  ’ I said to myself . Only 400 people were
sitting around me , but when I looked out , I imagined millions more . I did not write the speech only
with the UN delegates in mind ; I wrote it for every person around the world who could make a
difference . I wanted to reach all people living in poverty , those children forced to work and those
who suffer from terrorism or lack of education . Deep in my heart I hoped to reach every child who
could take courage from my words and stand up for his or her rights . 
I wore one of Benazir Bhutto ’ s white shawls over my favourite pink shalwar kamiz and I called on
the world ’ s leaders to provide free education to every child in the world .  ‘ Let us pick up our books
and our pens ,  ’ I said .  ‘ They are our most powerful weapons . One child , one teacher , one book and
one pen can change the world .  ’ I didn ’ t know how my speech was received until the audience gave
me a standing ovation . My mother was in tears and my father said I had become everybody ’ s
daughter . 
Something else happened that day . My mother allowed herself to be publicly photographed for the
first time . As she has lived her life in purdah and never unveiled her face on camera before , it was a
great sacrifice and very difficult for her . 
At breakfast the next day Atal said to me in the hotel ,  ‘ Malala , I don ’ t understand why you are
famous . What have you done ?  ’ All the time we were in New York he was more excited by the Statue
of Liberty , Central Park and his favourite game Beyblade ! 
After the speech I received messages of support from all over the world , but there was mostly
silence from my own country , except that on Twitter and Facebook we could see my own Pakistani
brothers and sisters turning against me . They accused me of speaking out of ‘ a teen lust for fame ’  . One
said ,  ‘ Forget the image of your country , forget about the school . She would eventually get what she
was after , a life of luxury abroad .  ’ 
I don ’ t mind . I know people say these things because they have seen leaders and politicians in our
country who make promises they never keep . Instead things in Pakistan are getting worse every day . 
The endless terrorist attacks have left the whole nation in shock . People have lost trust in each other , 
but I would like everyone to know that I don ’ t want support for myself , I want the support to be for my
cause of peace and education . 
The most surprising letter I got after my speech was from a Taliban commander who recently
escaped from prison . His name was Adnan Rashid and he used to be in the Pakistan air force . He had
been in jail since 2003 for attempting to assassinate President Musharraf . He said the Taliban had
attacked me not for my campaign for education but because I tried to ‘ malign [ their ] efforts to
establish the Islamic system ’  . He said he was writing to me because he was shocked by my shooting
and wished he could have warned me beforehand . He wrote that they would forgive me if I came back
to Pakistan , wore a burqa and went to a madrasa . 
Journalists urged me to answer him , but I thought , Who is this man to say that ? The Taliban are not
our rulers . It ’ s my life , how I live it is my choice . But Mohammed Hanif wrote an article pointing out
that the good thing about the Taliban letter was that many people claim I wasn ’ t shot yet here they
were accepting responsibility . 
I know I will go back to Pakistan , but whenever I tell my father I want to go home , he finds excuses . 
 ‘ No , Jani , your treatment is not complete ,  ’ he says , or ,  ‘ These schools are good . You should stay
here and gather knowledge so you can use your words powerfully .  ’ 
He is right . I want to learn and be trained well with the weapon of knowledge . Then I will be able
to fight more effectively for my cause . 
Today we all know education is our basic right . Not just in the West ; Islam too has given us this
right . Islam says every girl and every boy should go to school . In the Quran it is written , God wants us
to have knowledge . He wants us to know why the sky is blue and about oceans and stars . I know it ’ s a
big struggle – around the world there are fifty-seven million children who are not in primary school , 
thirty-two million of them girls . Sadly my own country Pakistan is one of the worst places : 5 . 1
million children don ’ t even go to primary school even though in our constitution it says every child
has that right . We have almost fifty million illiterate adults , two-thirds of whom are women , like my
own mother . 
Girls continue to be killed and schools blown up . In March there was an attack on a girls ’ school in
Karachi that we had visited . A bomb and a grenade were tossed into the school playground just as a
prize-giving ceremony was about to start . The headmaster , Abdur Rasheed , was killed and eight
children hurt between the ages of five and ten . One eight-year-old was left disabled . When my mother
heard the news , she cried and cried .  ‘ When our children are sleeping we wouldn ’ t even disturb a hair
on their heads ,  ’ she said ,  ‘ but there are people who have guns and shoot them or hurl bombs . They
don ’ t care that their victims are children .  ’ The most shocking attack was in June in the city of Quetta
when a suicide bomber blew up a bus taking forty pupils to their all-girls ’ college . Fourteen of them
were killed . The wounded were followed to the hospital and some nurses were shot . 
It ’ s not just the Taliban killing children . Sometimes it ’ s drone attacks , sometimes it ’ s wars , 
sometimes it ’ s hunger . And sometimes it ’ s their own family . In June two girls my age were murdered
in Gilgit , which is a little north of Swat , for posting a video online showing themselves dancing in the
rain wearing traditional dress and headscarves . Apparently their own stepbrother shot them . 
Today Swat is more peaceful than other places , but there are still military everywhere , four years
after they supposedly removed the Taliban . Fazlullah is still on the loose and our bus driver still
under house arrest . Our valley , which was once a haven for tourists , is now seen as a place of fear . 
Foreigners who want to visit have to get a No Objection Certificate from the authorities in Islamabad . 
Hotels and craft shops are empty . It will be a long time before tourists return . 
Over the last year I ’ ve seen many other places , but my valley remains to me the most beautiful
place in the world . I don ’ t know when I will see it again but I know that I will . I wonder what
happened to the mango seed I planted in our garden at Ramadan . I wonder if anyone is watering it so
that one day future generations of daughters and sons can enjoy its fruit . 
Today I looked at myself in a mirror and thought for a second . Once I had asked God for one or two
extra inches in height , but instead he made me as tall as the sky , so high that I could not measure
myself . So I offered the hundred raakat nafl prayers that I had promised if I grew . 
I love my God . I thank my Allah . I talk to him all day . He is the greatest . By giving me this height to
reach people , he has also given me great responsibilities . Peace in every home , every street , every
village , every country – this is my dream . Education for every boy and every girl in the world . To sit
down on a chair and read my books with all my friends at school is my right . To see each and every
human being with a smile of happiness is my wish . 
I am Malala . My world has changed but I have not .

Acknowledgements
The last year has shown me both the extreme hatred of man and the limitless love of God . So many
people have helped me that it would take a whole new book to name them all here , but I would like to
thank everyone in Pakistan and all round the world who prayed for me , all the schoolchildren , 
students and other supporters who rose when I fell . I am grateful for every petal of the bouquets and
every letter of the cards and messages . 
I was very lucky to be born to a father who respected my freedom of thought and expression and
made me part of his peace caravan , and a mother who not only encouraged me but my father too in our
campaign for peace and education . 
I have been blessed too with teachers , especially Miss Ulfat , who taught me a lot beyond textbooks
such as patience , tolerance and manners . 
Many people have described my recovery as miraculous , and for this I would particularly like to
thank the doctors and nurses at Swat Central Hospital , CMH Peshawar and AFIC Rawalpindi , 
especially my heroes Colonel Junaid and Dr Mumtaz , who carried out the right operation at the right
time or I would have died . Thanks also to Brigadier Aslam , who saved my major organs from failure
after surgery . 
I am extremely grateful to General Kayani , who took a keen interest in my treatment , and to
President Zardari and his family , whose love and care kept me strong . Thanks to the UAE government
and Crown Prince Mohammad bin Zayed for the use of their plane . 
Dr Javid Kayani made me laugh in my gloomy days and was like a father to me . He was the man
behind my treatment in the UK and first-class rehabilitation . Dr Fiona Reynolds was a great source of
comfort to my parents in Pakistan and to me in the UK , and I thank her too for daring to tell me the
truth about my tragedy . 
The staff at Queen Elizabeth Hospital , Birmingham have been amazing . Julie and her team of nurses
were so kind to me , and Beth and Kate were not only nurses but like loving sisters . I ’ d particularly
like to thank Yma Choudhury , who took great care of me and made sure I had everything I needed , 
even going on daily KFC runs . 
Richard Irving deserves a particular mention for his surgery to restore my smile , as does Mrs
Anwen White who restored my skull . 
Fiona Alexander not only managed the media superbly but went far beyond , even helping to arrange
schooling for me and my brothers , always with a smile . 
Rehanna Sadiq has been a wonderful comfort with her spiritual therapy . 
Thanks to Shiza Shahid and her family for all their incredible kindness and for helping set up the

were strangers and they helped us adjust to this land and find a place to live . Also thanks to driver
Shahid Hussein . 
On the book , our special thanks to Christina , who turned into reality what was just a dream . We
never imagined how a lady not from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa or Pakistan could show such remarkable
love and understanding of our country . 
We have been extremely lucky to have a literary agent like Karolina Sutton , who has thrown herself
into this project and our cause with such passion and commitment , and also an incredible team of

volunteer .

brothers Khushal and Atal for keeping me still a child .

at the Sunday Times , for allowing me the time for this important project . My husband Paulo and son

Above all , thanks to Malala and her wonderful family for sharing their story with me .

A note on the Malala Fund
My goal in writing this book was to raise my voice on behalf of the millions of girls around the world
who are being denied their right to go to school and realise their potential . I hope my story will
inspire girls to raise their voice and embrace the power within themselves , but my mission does not
end there . My mission , our mission , demands that we act decisively to educate girls and empower
them to change their lives and communities . 
That is why I have set up the Malala Fund . 
The Malala Fund believes that each girl , and boy , has the power to change the world and that all
she needs is a chance . To give girls this chance , the Fund aspires to invest in efforts that empower
local communities , develop innovative solutions that build upon traditional approaches , and deliver
not just basic literacy but the tools , ideas and networks that can help girls find their voice and create a
better tomorrow . 
I hope that all of you will join this cause so that we can work together to make girls ’ education and
empowerment a true priority once and for all . Please join my mission .
