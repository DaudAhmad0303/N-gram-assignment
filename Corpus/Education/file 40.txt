The history of coeducation in U . S . higher education is explored through an
analysis of a database containing almost all 4-year undergraduate institutions
that operated in 1897 , 1924 , 1934 , or 1980 . The opening of coeducational institutions was continuous throughout its history , and the switching from singlesex was also fairly constant from 1835 to the 1950s before accelerating in the
1960s and 1970s . Older and private single-sex institutions were slower to become
coeducational , and institutions persisting as single-sex into the 1970s had lower
enrollment growth than those that switched earlier . Access to coeducational
institutions was associated with increased women ’ s educational attainment . 
Women now receive 57 percent of all bachelor of arts degrees in the
United States , and 97 percent of them are awarded by coeducational
institutions , defined here as institutions that admit both males and females and in which both can take classes together . 1 Although almost all
undergraduates in the United States today attend a coeducational institution , none could have prior to the appearance of the first such
college around 1835 . When did institutions of higher education become
coeducational , why did they , and what was the impact of coeducation
on women ’ s educational attainment ? 
Bernie Zipprich provided exceptional research assistance on all parts of the project , 
and Ryan Sakoda followed in turn . Julia Fifer helped with the coding of the coeducation
data set , and Janet Currie and Louis Galambos supplied some of the coeducation dates .

Journal and an anonymous referee for further comments . 1 Newcomer ( 1959 ) also employs this definition . Whether or not males and females
choose to take the same courses and concentrate in the same subjects , and whether or
not they are admitted using the same criteria , are different matters .

These subjects are explored through an analysis of a database containing information on all institutions of higher education offering 4-
year undergraduate degrees that operated in 1897 , 1924 , or 1934 , most
of which still exist today . 2 Data on all 4-year institutions in 1980 that
were founded from 1934 to 1980 , or established as 4-year institutions
during that period , are added to the database . These data reveal some
surprises about the timing of coeducation and the reasons for its
increase . 3
We find that the founding of coeducational institutions in the public
and private sectors occurred at a fairly steady rate from 1835 to 1980 . 
In addition , the rate of switching from single-sex to coeducational status
was also relatively continuous from the 1860s through the 1950s . Although the rate of switching increased considerably in the 1960s and
1970s , the jump was greatest for Catholic single-sex institutions , especially female-only schools , and in the Northeast . 
The relative continuity that we find in the evolution of coeducational
schools contrasts sharply with the implications of the most commonly
found reasons offered for its rise . These reasons include war , ideological
change , and national economic downturns . 4 Such factors would imply
a more episodic evolution of coeducation . 
The most recent period of switching in the 1960s and 1970s , during
which Dartmouth , Princeton , Yale , and a host of elite liberal arts colleges
became coeducational , is shown to have increased the fraction of undergraduates in coeducational schools by only a small amount . Although
the change opened the doors of many of the best institutions in the
nation to women , many others had been opened for a long time . 
We offer a framework to understand the switch from single-sex to
coeducational status that emphasizes potential trade-offs between the
demand for a coeducational or single-sex environment by current and
2 The 1934 Coeducation College Database contains 769 institutions that existed at some
point from 1897 to 1934 . Of these , 22 closed by 1934 and 59 of the remaining 748
institutions closed after 1934 ( others merged but did not officially close )  . Therefore , only
about 8 percent of the institutions existing in 1934 subsequently closed . 3 The historical literature on coeducation and higher education is sparse . An excellent , 
but brief , review piece is Rosenberg ( 1988 )  . See also the essays in Miller-Bernal and Poulson 
( 2004 )  . Several articles contain short summaries of the history of coeducation , including
Graham ( 1978 )  . Early writings on coeducation include Thomas ( 1900 ) and Woody ( 1929 )  . 
On coeducation at Catholic institutions , see Poulson ( 1995 )  . A thicker literature exists on
women ’ s education . See Newcomer ( 1959 ) on women ’ s colleges and Solomon ( 1985 ) on
women ’ s higher education . Some insightful research exists on individual colleges and
universities , including Conable ( 1977 ) on Cornell University and McGuigan ( 1970 ) on
the University of Michigan . 4 On the role of the Civil War in reducing the supply of male students , see Newcomer 
( 1959 , 12 )  , Graham ( 1978 , 764 )  , and Rosenberg ( 1988 )  ; Solomon ( 1985 , 188 ) discusses
similar factors with regard to World War II . On war and the changing perceptions of
women , see Conable ( 1977 )  , and on the GI Bill in opening women ’ s colleges to men , see
Newcomer ( 1959 )  , Solomon ( 1985 )  , and Eisenmann ( 1997 )  . Newcomer ( 1959 ) discusses
the Great Depression in spurring coeducation among some schools , and Miller-Bernal 
( 2004 ) claims that both world wars and the Great Depression created financial hardships
for small single-sex institutions and prompted them to switch . 
College Coeducation from 1835 to the Present 379
future undergraduates , on the one hand , and expected alumni contributions by past and future graduates , on the other . Estimates of hazard
models of the time to switching from single-sex to coeducational status
suggest the role of alumni influence . We find that older and privately
controlled institutions were slower to switch from single sex to coeducation . Linear probability models of institutional switchers with controls
for both institutional characteristics and time-varying measures of the
competitive environment reinforce our findings on continuity in the
rate of switching from the 1870s to the 1950s followed by a sharp acceleration in the 1960s and 1970s . In a separate analysis we demonstrate
that by the 1960s the undergraduate enrollments at institutions that
shifted to coeducational status grew faster than those that delayed
switching . 
Greater access to coeducation in higher education , as we demonstrate , 
had a positive impact on women ’ s college attainment in the period
before the 1930s . Currie and Moretti ( 2003 ) present similar findings
for the more recent period . Even when women ’ s colleges existed in an
area , an increase in coeducational institutions furthered the college
education of women relative to men because women ’ s colleges were
costly and many coeducational institutions were public and less expensive . 
The paper is structured as follows . We begin with a brief history of
coeducation and then move to a discussion of our coeducation database
and a description of the evolution of coeducation . We develop a framework to understand the shift to coeducation by single-sex institutions
and then use our data to detect which factors mattered , thereby testing
the validity of the framework . The impact of coeducation on female
educational attainment is addressed next . We close with a section on
the end of in loco parentis , the spread of sex-blind admissions , and the
commencement of real gender equality in higher education . 
I . Coeducation Historically Considered
In 1897 , 56 percent of all undergraduates and 60 percent of undergraduate women were enrolled in coeducational institutions ( table 1 , 
panel A )  . Coeducation varied considerably by region in 1897 , with the
Northeast educating just 29 percent of its undergraduates in dual-sex
institutions , the South 40 percent , and the Midwest and the West around
86 percent ( panel B )  . 
Much changed with regard to coeducation in the next quarter century . In 1924 almost three-quarters of all undergraduates were in coeducational settings . Even in the Northeast , 52 percent were in coeducational settings and 60 percent were in the South . 5 By 1980 , virtually

Note . —The definition of “ student ” changes somewhat across the years . In 1897 , the students are in the “ collegiate ” group and do not include those
in professional and graduate programs . In 1924 , all students ( undergraduates , graduates , and those in professional programs ) except those in
preparatory and summer school programs are included . The 1934 data allow various combinations for comparison : 1934U includes only arts and
sciences undergraduates ; 1934UP adds undergraduates in first professional degree programs , which were mainly in engineering ; 1934UPG includes
all undergraduates ( plus those in first professional programs ) and graduates . The 1934UPG line is most comparable to 1924 , the 1934U line is most
comparable to 1897 , and the 1934UP line is probably most comparable to 1966 and 1980 . Undergraduate enrollment data for 1980 are used for the
1966 and 1980 coeducation figures . Institutions are categorized in 1966 on the basis of 1966 enrollment data .

Note . —The isolation index gives the degree to which a typical female
student is “ isolated ” from male students . Isolation , termed I , gives the
share female of the students in one ’ s own institution experienced by the
typical female student . It is computed as the average across institutions
of the fraction female among the students in the institution (  ) Fi i / T
weighted by each institution ’ s female students as a share of the aggregate
number of female students in all institutions (  )  , where Fi 
/ F i denotes each

the isolation index would be 0 .

all undergraduates were educated in coeducational institutions . 6 The
trend for privately controlled institutions closely follows that for all institutions , although private institutions had a lower coeducation share
in 1897 than those in the public sector . 
The typical female undergraduate in 1897 went to an institution in
which 60 percent of the students were female , even though only 29
percent of all undergraduates in 4-year institutions were ( table 2 , cols . 
1 and 2 )  . In contrast , the typical female college student in 1980 was in
a school with only a slightly higher share of women than that faced by
the typical male student . A revealing summary statistic is the “ isolation
index ,  ” which measures the degree to which the typical woman is educationally segregated from men , with 0 being perfect integration and
1 being complete segregation by sex ( i . e .  , only single-sex institutions )  . 
In 1897 the isolation index was 0 . 44 ; it decreased to 0 . 30 by around
1930 , and then to 0 . 05 by 1980 ( table 2 , col . 3 )  . 7
6 Our data differ from those in Newcomer ( 1959 , tables 2 , 3 )  . The college data she
uses , from the U . S . Office of Education , include 2-year institutions whereas ours do not . 
In consequence , she obtains a higher fraction of women in coeducational institutions and
a lower fraction in women ’ s colleges . 7 The isolation index , it should be noted , takes as given the proportion of students who
are female and examines the extent to which female students are institutionally integrated
with their male counterparts . 
College Coeducation from 1835 to the Present 383
The earliest coeducational institutions in the United States were
founded by abolitionists , Congregationalists , Quakers , Methodists , and
others committed to equality in general . The institutions were disproportionately founded in the newer parts of the young nation , known at
the time as the “ West ,  ” and included many in Ohio , such as Antioch , 
Marietta , Oberlin , and Wilberforce . Of the 54 institutions that became
coeducational before 1860 ( and existed in 1934 )  , 27 were in the five
states of the Old Northwest ( Ohio , Michigan , Indiana , Illinois , and Wisconsin ) and another 13 were in states west of the Mississippi . Only one
was in New England ( Bates College in Maine )  . 
The public sector entered the coeducation arena somewhat later than
the private sector . Of the 30 public institutions founded before 1860 
( and existing in 1934 )  , just three were coeducational at the time of
founding or soon thereafter , whereas of the 195 private institutions
founded before 1860 , 50 ( or 26 percent ) were coeducational at founding
or within a decade of founding . 8 There was a slower response of the
public sector in part because more than half of its 30 institutions
founded before 1860 were in the South and southerners had a preference for single-sex education . 9 But even in the absence of the South , 
the public sector was a coeducational laggard . 10 Another reason for the
greater prevalence of coeducation among private as opposed to public
institutions in the antebellum era was the religious control of many of
the private institutions and the commitment of certain religious denominations to access by all people . 
The public sector quickly became more closely associated with coeducation as it moved west . Of the 34 publicly controlled institutions
founded from 1861 to 1880 , 24 ( or 71 percent ) were established as
coeducational institutions or became so within a decade . In the private
sector , 122 were founded from 1861 to 1880 , and 59 of these ( or 48
percent ) were coeducational within a decade of founding . 11
The public higher education sector in the western parts of the nation
was coeducational in the nineteenth century for the same reasons that
primary and secondary schools in the West were . 12 These regions were
sparsely settled , and coeducational facilities were cost effective . 
There was , in addition , a commitment on the part of the public sector
to offer training for certain professionals , such as teachers and nurses , 
8 Excluding Catholic institutions , the private sector had 171 institutions founded before
1861 , of which 50 ( or 29 percent ) were coeducational . 9 In 1861 , just 9 percent of private institutions in the South were coeducational , whereas
36 percent were in the rest of the nation . 10 Nonsouthern states established 14 public institutions before the Civil War , and two
were coeducational within 5 years ( Iowa State University and the University of Utah )  . 
Another ( Michigan State ) was coeducational after 5 years . 11 Excluding Catholic institutions established from 1861 to 1880 , the private sector
founded 105 new institutions , and 58 of these ( or 55 percent ) were coeducational within
a decade of founding . 12 All were coeducational at their founding except for mining schools in the Pacific
and Mountain states . 
384 Journal of Human Capital
and , in much of the nation , to provide equal access . For cash-strapped
states , coeducation was cheaper . In 1870 , for example , the Michigan
state legislature forced the University of Michigan to accept women
rather than build a separate institution for them . 13
Coeducational colleges and universities proliferated in regions that
led in the high school movement . In fact , the main reason there could
have been a shift to college coeducation in the United States is that 
( coeducational ) secondary education spread across much of the nation
in the mid to late nineteenth century . 14 Girls , in fact , went to and graduated from high school in the United States at higher rates than boys
in the late nineteenth century and in every state from the early twentieth
century to at least 1940 . 15
The United States was distinctive in the nineteenth century and for
much of the twentieth century in terms of the extent of precollege
training for women and its coeducational nature . At the turn of the
twentieth century , some Europeans expressed disbelief that Americans
educated young women together with young men . The ( female ) French
minister of public instruction remarked in 1893 :  “ Of all the features
which characterize American [ secondary school ] education , perhaps the
most striking is the coeducation of young men and young women .  .  . 
for it reveals a state of mind and of habits which is entirely strange ”  
( Goldin and Katz 2008 , 154 )  . 
As more coeducational institutions were established in an area , the
prospective founders of new institutions often used the successes of
female students in existing coeducational institutions to argue for coeducation . Andrew Dickson White did precisely that to justify coeducation at Cornell in 1872 when he was the inaugural president of that
institution . 16
When male-only institutions were preponderant , as they were in New
England and parts of the Middle Atlantic , first-mover disadvantage ap13 See McGuigan ( 1970 ) and Rosenberg ( 1988 ) on coeducation at the University of
Michigan . 14 This pattern can be seen in the western states , but the same factors played out within
other states . For example , M . Carey Thomas noted the case of Massachusetts :  “ It was
impossible until 1878 for a Boston girl to be prepared for college in a city high school 
[ because Latin schools in Boston were male only ]  , whereas , in the country towns of
Massachusetts , where boys and girls were taught together .  .  . the girl had had the same
opportunities as the boy ”  ( 1900 , 4 n . 1 )  . 15 On the high school movement and gender imbalance in secondary schools , see Goldin 
( 1998 ) and Goldin and Katz ( 2008 )  . 16 Cornell ’ s founders did not consider the issue of coeducation when the institution
opened in 1868 . Nothing in the charter of the institution made it male only . White formed
a committee to examine the subject and marshaled evidence on women ’ s successes and
achievements from Antioch , Oberlin , and Michigan . White ’ s report and Henry Sage ’ s
large donation allowed the institution , in 1872 , to become truly coeducational , with a
residence for women . Conable ( 1977 ) provides an excellent account of the origins of
coeducation at Cornell University but also tries to defend the point that coeducation was
not equal education at Cornell for a long time to come . 
College Coeducation from 1835 to the Present 385
pears to have dominated . 17 None in a competitive group could move
successfully alone , as the case of Wesleyan demonstrates . Wesleyan College ( now University ) opened in 1831 as a male-only Methodist institution . It became coeducational in 1871 , largely because of Methodist
commitment to equality in the wake of the Civil War . In 1909 , Wesleyan
returned to single-sex status , in part because of the hostile reaction to
female undergraduates by male undergraduates and because its closest
competitors were elite male-only colleges . Wesleyan became coeducational again in 1969 ( see Potts 1992 )  . 
Only long after male student demand demonstrably shifted in favor
of a coeducational environment did most of the male-only schools in
the Northeast become coeducational institutions . Our model explains
such a lag in the institutional response to shifts in demand as arising
from concerns about jeopardizing alumni giving . 
II . The Coeducation College Database
The Coeducation College Database was formed in two parts . The first
part , termed the 1934 Coeducation College Database , contains information for all institutions of higher education granting a 4-year degree
in existence in 1897 , 1924 , or 1934 . The data include time-invariant
variables such as opening year . Religious affiliation and public versus
private control can vary but are generally time invariant . 18 Other variables are time varying and exist in the data set for the three years given 
( e . g .  , the number of students enrolled and faculty by program , degrees
granted , revenue by source , and expenditure by category )  . The surveys
from which these data were taken were executed by the U . S . Office of
Education . The first was published in the 1897 Annual Report of the
Commissioner of Education . The other two come from the 1922–24 and
1932–34 Biennial Surveys of the Commissioner of Education . The 1930s data
were supplemented with those from the 1933 College Blue Book ( Hurt
and Hurt 1933 )  . 
There are 769 institutions in the 1934 Coeducation College Database , 
almost all of which were 4-year BA-granting institutions in 1934 ( see the
Data Appendix )  . Of the full group , 81 percent were privately controlled
and 44 percent were nonsectarian . Catholic was the most common religious affiliation , with 16 percent of all institutions ( see table 3 )  . 
A critical variable to the investigation here is the year in which an
institution became coeducational , if it did . We define a coeducational
17 The single-sex status quo dominated because many of the male-only institutions in
the Northeast were the finest academically in the region . The public sector in the Northeast
was held back compared with that in the rest of the nation ( Goldin and Katz 1999 )  . 
Deviation from the male-only standard in the Northeast was a signal of financial or other
weakness . When academic markets widened geographically and when male students preferred to be in coeducational settings , the switch to coeducation became universal . 18 Very few institutions ( e . g .  , Rutgers ) changed control over time .

classes must include the central ones in a liberal arts college and cannot
be limited to a particular school , such as nursing or education . 
Some institutions opened coeducational and others “ switched .  ” In the
1934 Coeducation College Database , 42 percent of the institutions
opened coeducational ( 39 percent of those in the private sector and
56 percent in the public sector )  , and 85 percent of the remainder
switched at some date to the present . 19
The moment a single-sex institution switches is generally clear , but
classification of some institutions required deeper information . Take
Harvard and Radcliffe , for example . Harvard opened in 1638 ; Radcliffe
opened in 1882 but never had a faculty of its own . Harvard professors
would teach a course in the Harvard Yard and then walk to the Radcliffe
Yard and give the course to female undergraduates . When the United
States entered World War II , some faculty decided to teach men and
women together on an experimental basis , and a year later , in 1943 , 
coeducational instruction was accepted . Admissions remained separate
until 1976 , when gender-blind admissions were instituted . Because the
definition employed here concerns the sharing of classrooms , the 1943
date is employed . 20
Institutional data across the three years ( 1897 , 1924 , and 1934 ) are
linked . Mergers that occurred between reporting dates are resolved , but
those that occurred before 1897 cannot be considered because institutions that did not survive to 1897 are not in the database . If an institution closed after the 1930s , that date is also recorded . The date in
which an institution became coeducational is either the opening date
or the date in which coeducation was established , gleaned from Web
sites , personal correspondence , and archival information . All institutions that began as single-sex institutions are followed to the present to
determine when they became coeducational , if they did . There are 35
female-only colleges still in existence from this group and three maleonly colleges . 
The second part of the data set , termed the 1980 Coeducation College
Database , adds to the group of institutions existing in 1934 all the 4-
year institutions existing in 1980 that opened after 1934 and contains
19 Information on whether the institution opened coeducational or single sex is available
for 753 ( 682 of which remained in operation to the present ) of the 769 institutions . 20 There are other relevant dates in the coeducation history of Harvard and Radcliffe . 
Radcliffe women received Harvard degrees in 1963 , but the printed degree included the
Radcliffe College name until 1977 , when an agreement formally put Radcliffe women in
Harvard College . Coeducational residential halls are another matter and were formalized
at Harvard in 1972 . The switch to them is important in the ability of the institution to
have gender-blind admissions , as we will later discuss .

information on institutional closings and mergers since 1934 . 21 Standard
National Center for Education Statistics ( NCES ) Federal Interagency
Committee on Education ( FICE ) codes and Integrated Postsecondary
Education Database System ( IPEDS ) UnitID codes are added to the full
list of institutions . The database includes 1980 enrollment numbers by
sex for all institutions surviving to 1980 . 
Thus , the resulting data set contains information on the approximately 1 , 500 4-year institutions that existed from around 1897 to the
present . Enrollment , faculty , and financial data are included for 1897 , 
1924 , and 1934 . The year when an institution became coeducational , if
it began single sex , is included for all institutions . Precise opening years
are available for the 1934 sample but not always for the group that is
included after 1934 . Some of the institutions added to the 1934 group
were previously 2-year colleges , and the precise year in which the school
became a 4-year institution is often difficult to ascertain . 22
The information on students differs across the various data sets . The
1897 data include undergraduates in the “ collegiate ” group and exclude
graduate and preparatory students . Independent professional and theological schools in 1897 are omitted from the sample . The 1924 student
data include all students , both undergraduate and graduate , but exclude
those in summer school , extension , and military drill courses . The 1934
data separate undergraduates from graduate students and also from
those enrolled in a first professional program . 
III . Chronology of Coeducation : College Openings and Switchers
In 1934 , 64 percent of all 4-year institutions with undergraduates were
coeducational and 70 percent of undergraduate enrollments were in
coeducational institutions . Of the coeducational schools at that time , 
34 percent had begun as single-sex institutions . 
Coeducation occurs through two routes : the establishment of new
coeducational institutions and the conversion of previously single-sex
institutions . In the period to 1934 , the more important of these two
routes was the establishment of public and private institutions that were
coeducational from their start . In 1900 , for example , 58 percent of
schools ( that existed in 1934 ) were coeducational , and 73 percent of
21 Many of the institutions that are added were established before 1934 but as 2-year
institutions , often teachers colleges . We have not been able to obtain the precise date at
which each of the added institutions became 4-year , in part because there was a lack of
good institutional memory and also because some of the institutions subsequently failed . 
But another reason is that , in many cases , there were a handful of students who did 4-
year degrees even when the institution was primarily 2-year . 22 A substantial number of the 4-year institutions in the 1980 database that are not
present in the 1934 database give opening dates that are before 1934 . These institutions
were not captured in the Office of Education statistics as 4-year schools in 1934 . Many of
these schools opened as 2-year institutions prior to 1934 but actually became 4-year institutions between 1934 and 1980 . 
College Coeducation from 1835 to the Present 389
them had been coeducational from their inception . Similarly , 46 percent
of schools were coeducational in 1880 , and 72 percent of these were
founded as coeducational institutions . 23
The establishment of male-only schools ( in the 1934 Coeducation
College Database ) from the early 1800s occurred in a fairly steady manner . Their founding , however , waned after the 1890s ( fig . 1 , part A )  . 
Similarly , the Catholic group of male-only institutions increased continuously to 1890 ( fig . 1 , part C )  . The establishment of female-only institutions was somewhat less continuous and did not diminish in the period
to 1934 . Spurts in the founding of female-only institutions occurred at
times , such as in the early 1870s and 1890s . A lull in the establishment
of women ’ s colleges occurred in the 1860s . Oddly enough , given the
Civil War disruption , there was no corresponding pause in the establishment of male-only institutions . The 1910s and 1920s saw the establishment of many new female-only colleges , most of which were Catholic
schools ( fig . 1 , part C )  . Female-only Catholic schools were almost nonexistent before 1900 but exceeded the male-only Catholic schools in
number by the mid-1920s . 
Prior to 1835 there were no coeducational institutions of higher education in the United States . But that soon began to change . The opening of schools that began as coeducational institutions was fairly continuous starting in 1835 , although there was some increase from the
mid-1860s to the 1890s ( fig . 1 , part A )  . The vast majority of colleges
and universities that began as coeducational institutions during the latter part of the nineteenth century were privately controlled , not public
state institutions ( fig . 1 , part B )  . The importance of the private sector
in the growth of coeducational institutions in the late nineteenth century may be surprising given the importance of federal legislation that
set up the great state universities that are part of the “ land grant ” institutions . 
The Morrill Act of 1862 , which allowed for the establishment of the
land grant universities , gave states federal lands they could sell to fund
the institutions . 24 Many of today ’ s flagship state institutions were
founded under the Morrill Act . The Morrill Act was a landmark piece
of legislation and led to the founding of a large number of public
institutions , some of which were coeducational at their establishment . 25
One might expect , therefore , the founding of coeducational colleges
23 According to the 1934 enrollment figures , 65 percent of enrollment was in coeducational institutions in 1900 and 61 percent of enrollment was in institutions that were
coeducational at their opening . 24 During the Civil War , only the states loyal to the Union received Morrill Act land
grants , and those in the Confederacy received them when they rejoined the Union after
the war . 25 The 1862 Morrill Act did not require that the institutions founded under its auspices
be coeducational , and many were not at their outset . The “ second Morrill Act ” in 1890
concerned the exclusion of blacks from Morrill Act schools in the South and set up many
of the historically black colleges and universities .

College Coeducation from 1835 to the Present 391
and universities in the post-1861 period to have been dominated by the
public sector . 
In terms of the number of institutions , the private sector clearly dominates in the two periods 1861–80 and 1881–1900 . 26 The private sector
added about 72 percent of the coeducational schools founded in those
decades . By enrollment , the public sector is more important in the 1861–
80 period ( with the private sector accounting for about 46 percent of
the growth in coeducation using 1897 enrollments and 33 percent using
1934 enrollments )  . 27 That finding is to be expected since the public
institutions established in those years , such as the Universities of California , Colorado , Kansas , Illinois , Minnesota , and Washington , rapidly
became behemoths . But the private sector was far more important during the 1881–1900 period , accounting for 70 percent of the increase in
enrollments in coeducational institutions ( using 1897 enrollments and
51 percent using 1934 enrollments )  . 
The decadal shift from single-sex ( predominantly male-only ) to coeducational institutions increased in the years immediately following
1860 but then continued in a somewhat unbroken fashion from the
Civil War decade to the 1950s ( see fig . 2 , part A )  . About 8 percent of
the male-only undergraduate institutions that existed at the start of the
decade switched to coeducational status by the end of the decade , for
each decade from 1861 to 1950 . 28
The decadal rate of switching was higher in the 1860s than before
and a bit higher in the 1870s than just after , which might lend some
credence to the notion that the wartime absence of men led to coeducation . 29 But for the entire group of men ’ s colleges , these rates are
not much different from those in any of the decades from the 1860s to
the 1950s . Of some interest is that the rates during the Great Depression
and World War II are not greater than those extending back to the
1860s , and for the men ’ s non-Catholic group , they are considerably
smaller ( fig . 2 , part B )  . These findings hold up in the hazard and linear
probability analyses to be presented . 
Catholic institutions ( not shown separately ) experienced relatively
little switching until the 1960s . Many orders founded separate women ’ s
colleges in the early to late 1920s to meet the demand for college on
26 The fact that the private sector was more important in terms of the number of
institutions should not be too surprising since each state generally founded just one land
grant institution . 27 The reason that the 1897 figure is larger than that using 1934 enrollments concerns
the relative growth of the state universities during the first third of the twentieth century . 28 Throughout this paper , the proportion of single-sex institutions ( all or male only or
female only ) existing at the start of a decade that became coeducational during that
decade will be referred to as the hazard rate , as in fig . 2 . 29 Institutions that may have folded in the 1860s cannot be observed , although a search
of institutions that closed does not yield a large number for the 1860s . In addition , although
some may have folded , the question here is the shift to coeducation . 
Figure 2 . —Hazard rate and the number of institutions that switched to coeducation in
the decade ( full sample )  . Sources : See the Data Appendix . The sample used includes all
institutions that opened to 1980 . Hazard rate # 100 is the percentage of single-sex institutions ( all or male only ) existing at the start of the decade that switched during the
decade . Switched to coed in decade is the number of single-sex institutions ( all or male
only ) that switched to coeducational status in the decade given . 
College Coeducation from 1835 to the Present 393
the part of women rather than have their men ’ s colleges become coeducational . 
The hazard rate did increase considerably in the 1960s for men ’ s and
women ’ s Catholic institutions and for men ’ s non-Catholic colleges ( fig . 
2 , part B )  . At that point in the history of coeducation a large fraction
of the preexisting men ’ s non-Catholic schools had already become coeducational institutions . In fact , 72 percent of non-Catholic institutions
founded as male only had switched by 1960 . Almost all of the remaining
male-only schools ( both Catholic and non-Catholic schools ) switched
to coeducational status during the 1960s and 1970s . 30 We discuss this
important period and the role of Title IX later . 
The growth of coeducational institutions for both the total and the
non-Catholic group is shown in figure 3 by institution ( part A ) and
weighted by 1934 enrollment ( part B )  . In 1860 , 25 percent of all institutions ( which also existed in 1934 ) were coeducational ( 14 percent of
the 1934 weighted enrollment )  . In 1870 , 35 percent of the institutions
were coeducational ( 39 percent of the 1934 weighted enrollment )  , and
by 1890 , more than half of the institutions were coeducational ( more
than 60 percent weighted )  . 31
Coeducation may have been bolstered by both the Morrill Land Grant
Act and the Civil War , but the increase in the fraction of coeducational
institutions appears relatively constant and substantial from 1861 to the
1910s . The emphasis by some that the Civil War had a strong direct
impact on coeducation seems misplaced . The surge in coeducational
public institutions , especially in the West , had a greater effect on coeducation than the impact of a dearth in college-aged men wrought by
the war . 32 Similarly , the emphasis on the role of World War II also seems
misplaced since the decades with the lowest rate of switching , before
the 1970s , are the 1940s and the 1950s . 
A substantial and prominent group of single-sex institutions ( including the “ big ” and “ little ” Ivies ) switched in the late 1960s and early
1970s . Because of the reputation of many in that group , the years from
1967 to 1975 are often accorded a special place in the history of coeducation . The period , however , is far less unique for non-Catholic
institutions than for Catholic ones . Whereas 20 percent of all switching
that occurred since 1835 did so from 1967 to 1975 for non-Catholic
30 For example , out of the approximately 222 non-Catholic male institutions that opened
to 1980 , just 38 remained as male-only institutions in 1970 , and just nine survived as all-male
colleges to 1980 . 31 The large increase from around 1865 to 1875 in the fraction of the 1934 enrollment
in coeducational schools given in fig . 3 , part B , is due to the establishment of various state
universities under the Morrill Land Grant Act , as we noted before . Even if the 1897
enrollment numbers are used , that decade still produces the largest increase in the fraction
of undergraduates in coeducational institutions . 32 On the Morrill Land Grant Act , see Radke-Moss ( 2008 )  , who emphasizes both the
changed ideology after the Civil War and the economic necessity of coeducation in the
sparsely settled West and Midwest . 
Figure 3 . —Fraction of institutions ( existing in 1934 ) that were coeducational by year . 
Sources : See the Data Appendix . 
College Coeducation from 1835 to the Present 395
institutions , 53 percent did for Catholic colleges . 33 Thus , if the period
bears any particular significance , it is in the transformation of Catholic
institutions of higher education ( see fig . 4 , part C )  . When the Catholic
institutions are omitted , the increase in coeducation is far less extreme
during the 1967–75 era ( compare parts A and B )  . 
The change to coeducation among the “ big ” Ivies ( Dartmouth , Princeton , and Yale ) and the “ little ” Ivies ( Amherst , Haverford , Wesleyan , 
Williams , and other prestigious liberal arts colleges such as Bowdoin , 
Colgate , Hamilton , Lafayette , and Lehigh ) has long been viewed as one
of enormous importance . According to many , their switch enabled large
numbers of high-performing women to be educated in schools that
trained the nation ’ s leaders and whose graduates entered the finest
professional and graduate schools . But the admission of women to maleonly institutions from 1967 to 1975 increased the percentage of undergraduate women taught in a coeducational environment by only
about 4 percentage points . 34 In fact , the switch from female-only to
coeducational institutions during those years had an approximately
equal impact on the fraction of women educated with men . 
One of the reasons that the opening up of many elite male-only
institutions did not have a larger impact is that many of the eastern
elite institutions were already coeducational and had been so for some
time . Although Dartmouth , Princeton , and Yale admitted undergraduate women for the first time in the period of change , four of the other
Ivies—Brown , Cornell , Harvard , and the University of Pennsylvania—
were already coeducational . Columbia University would not become
fully coeducational until 1983 , but the women in its coordinate college , 
Barnard , could take courses at Columbia . In the rest of the nation , the
very best institutions of higher education ( e . g .  , Stanford , University of
Chicago , Northwestern , Washington University at St . Louis ) began as
coeducational schools or became coeducational soon after their founding . 
Table 4 gives information on the top 50 schools in the nation according to the 2010 U . S . News and World Report list , when they first
opened and when each became coeducational . In the top 50 , 23 schools
began as coeducational institutions or switched to coed soon after founding , and seven others became coeducational before the early twentieth
century . In the top 25 , 11 were coeducational institutions at founding
or soon thereafter , and one other ( Duke ) became coeducational before
1900 . 
33 These figures include the single-sex institutions that opened after 1934 . 34 Institutions existing in 1966 are included and the 1980 enrollment data are used .

College Coeducation from 1835 to the Present 397
IV . Theoretical and Empirical Models of Switching from Single Sex
to Coeducational
To understand the factors that affect the decision to switch from a singlesex to a coeducational institution , we model the decisions of a college
that maximizes the present discounted value of its resources . Resources
can be thought of as the college ’ s endowment plus the present discounted value of expected future revenue streams ( coming from alumni
donations , tuition , research grants , and public-sector subsidies ) net of
expected future costs ( staffing , equipment , and materials costs )  , or as
a combination of faculty , buildings , other productive resources , savings , 
and future net revenue streams . In the private sector these resources
come mainly from tuition and alumni giving . 
Alumni live for a finite number of periods , and during their postcollege lives , they give to their institution an amount g per time period , 
which is a positive function of their ( intrinsic ) ability , q . They give the
amount g with probability if the institution remains as they knew it S ls 
( S p single sex ; the superscript refers to the current status of the institution and the subscript to its status at the time the individual received
a BA ) and less ,  , if the school switches to being coeducational . C S ls s ! l
We assume that college size does not change , and we consider only the
decisions and ability of the representative student from each cohort in
every period . 
If incoming students remain at a constant ability level , q , and the
school cannot increase the ability of incoming students by becoming
coeducational , the school will be in a steady state and has no reason to
deviate from its single-sex status . But if future potential students have
a reduced demand for attending a single-sex school relative to a coeducational school ( from changes in social attitudes increasing the demand for coeducation )  , then the school will be faced with a trade-off . 35
If the institution does not switch , it will be faced with lower-quality
incoming students , who will give less as alumni . If the institution becomes coeducational , existing alumni will cut back on their giving ( from
to )  , but the effect will be largely eroded over time as these indi- S C l l s s
viduals die . 36 In addition , the new alumni and alumnae will give more
because of their higher q , and the effect will be reinforced if is greater C
lc
than . S ls
The institution can remain single sex , appease existing alumni , but
35 A related change , reinforcing those from the increased demand of potential incoming
students for coeducation , is that current alumni may decrease and increase if their S C l l s s
daughters would benefit from college . Rossi ( 1987 ) provides guidance regarding the financial and demographic factors that led schools to remain single sex and those that
caused it to embrace coeducation . See also Miller-Bernal ( 2004 ) on the enrollment and
financial concerns of single-sex college administrators in the late 1960s . 36 The larger the group of alumni relative to current students and the more important
their donations relative to tuition , the longer it will take for the change to affect the
objective function of maximizing the present discounted value of resources .

get lesser-quality students , or it can switch to coeducational status , have
reduced giving among prior alumni , but gain better ( and possibly more ) 
students . 37 Intelligent administrators will discount the two streams and
choose the optimal switching date when long-term gains from switching
just begin to outweigh short-term losses . 
One of the model ’ s predictions in the face of secularly rising student
demand for coeducation is that current student quality will decline 
( particularly relative to competing coeducational institutions ) before a
single-sex school switches , and possibly long before . In addition , after
the switch , alumni donations will initially decline relative to what they
would have been in the absence of the switch to coeducation . Donations
will eventually improve as the composition of the alumni shifts toward
newer cohorts who attended in the coeducation regime . Nevertheless , 
under the optimal policy , an institution ’ s president will choose to “ bite
the bullet ” and make the switch before the net financial gains from
coeducation become apparent . 
The trade-offs suggested by the model are borne out in the histories
of single-sex schools . According to Karabel ( 2005 , chap . 14 )  , in 1956 , 
Yale ’ s admissions officer observed that many of the school ’ s best admits
had chosen coeducational institutions and that student quality at Yale
was declining . But Yale alumni were strongly resistant . By the mid-1960s , 
current students at Yale were demanding a switch to coeducation . At
Princeton , 55 percent of alumni polled in 1969 were opposed to coeducation , but the trustees supported the switch to stem declining quality . 38 Similar changes occurred at the other all-male institutions in the
1960s and 1970s . 
It should be emphasized that antidiscrimination legislation did not
play a quantitatively important role in the switch to coeducation . Title
37 The switch to coeducation is assumed in the model to be irrevocable , and , in fact , 
almost all were . 38 A dissent , filed by director of development Arthur J . Horton ’ 42 , noted :  “ I fear that
there will be alumni who , liking the University as an all-male institution , could lose much
of their present ardor ” and reduce their alumni giving . He asked :  “ Can we really argue
that we are not getting the best applicants when over 46% of our senior class graduated
last June with Honors ?  ” The Patterson Committee advocated the switch over member
Horton ’ s lone dissent ( Horton Dissent , August 28 , 1968 , available in the Arthur J . Horton
Collection on Coeducation , Seeley G . Mudd Manuscript Library , Princeton University , 
Princeton , NJ , box no . 4 , folder no . 5 )  . 
400 Journal of Human Capital
IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 was passed and its implementation written long after most male-only institutions had decided
to become coeducational . 39
There were , to be sure , other reasons for switching , such as institutionspecific fiscal shocks , depletion of potential students due to wartime
draft and fatalities , and general economic downturns , the effects of
which could be smoothed by a sufficiently large endowment . Public
institutions often face different constraints than private colleges because
pressures exist for public dollars to serve all people . 40 State legislatures
often forced coeducation on an institution to save expenses on building
a separate women ’ s college . 
We first examine the institutional characteristics associated with faster
or slower transitions of single-sex 4-year colleges to coeducational institutions . We estimate formal hazard models of the duration spent as
a single-sex school for all colleges starting as a single-sex school in our
1934 and 1980 Coeducation College Databases ( including all originally
single-sex schools present in 1897 , 1924 , 1934 , and / or 1980 )  . The estimation sample consists of 511 schools , of which 281 started as men ’ s
colleges and 230 started as women ’ s colleges . 
Cox proportional hazard models are estimated for the duration of a
spell as a single-sex school using a nonparametric ( fully flexible ) baseline hazard . 41 The time at risk for becoming a coeducational institution
is assumed to begin in 1835 , the year in which Marietta College opened
and a year after Oberlin College began coeducational classes . In 1837 , 
Oberlin was the first to accept female students into a BA-granting program and to switch from a single-sex to a coeducational institution . 42
Thus , the time at risk begins in 1835 for schools founded before 1835
and at the actual opening date for schools founded in 1835 or after . A 
 “ failure event ” is a transition to being a coeducational school . Schools
remaining single-sex institutions today ( three male-only and 35 femaleonly in our data set ) are treated as censored spells , with 2010 as the
39 The switch of most institutions to coeducation also preceded the interpretation of
Title IX in Mississippi University for Women v . Hogan , 102 Supreme Court Reporter 3331 
( 1982 )  , that private single-sex undergraduate institutions can be exempt from the admissions requirements of Title IX but must comply with constitutional equal protection
requirements in admissions . 40 As M . Carey Thomas , then president of Bryn Mawr College , noted around 1900 ,  
 “ public opinion in the United States almost universally demands that universities supported
by public taxation should provide for the college education of women ”  ( 1900 , 358b )  . 41 The findings are similar to those from standard parametric models such as with a
Weibull hazard . 42 Fletcher ( 1943 ) claims that , in 1834 , when the first college classes began at Oberlin ,  
 “  [ male ] college students shared their classrooms and class instructions with women ” and
also that “ in 1837 four ladies were admitted to the Collegiate Course [ at Oberlin ] with
the men and in 1841 three of them received the A . B . degree , the first bona fide college
degrees ever granted to women ”  ( 379–80 )  . Marietta College began in 1835 as a coeducational institution but may not have granted a BA degree until later .

Note . —The sample includes all 4-year institutions starting as single-sex institutions in our
1934 and 1980 Coeducation College Databases . In other words , the sample consists of all
originally single-sex schools present in our 1897 , 1924 , 1934 , or 1980 institutional samples . 
The estimation uses Cox proportional hazard models for the duration of a spell as a singlesex school with nonparametric baseline hazards estimated via maximum likelihood using
the stcox command in STATA . The time period at risk in the duration models begins in
the year of opening for institutions founded after 1835 and in 1835 for institutions that
opened before 1835 . The failure event is the transition to a coeducational institution . 
Schools that continue today as single-sex institutions are treated as censored spells , with
2010 as the date of censoring . Schools that closed as single-sex institutions are treated as
censored at the date of closing . The reported coefficients are hazard ratios . The standard
errors for the hazard ratios are in parentheses . The base region is the Northeast ( New
England plus the Middle Atlantic states )  . There are no land grant and no technical
institutions among the women ’ s colleges . 
censoring date ; schools that closed as single-sex schools are treated as
spells censored at the date of closing . 43
The basic hazard models for all single-sex schools and men ’ s and
women ’ s colleges separately are presented in table 5 . The models include as the covariates time-invariant institutional characteristics , including a continuous measure of the year of opening and indicator
variables for private control ( vs . public )  , religious affiliation , and region . 
The year of opening indicates the strength of alumni resistance to a
switch . The religious affiliation shows the particular ideology and , in
the case of Catholic institutions , the degree to which their decisions are
dictated by a higher authority and are therefore coordinated . The reported coefficients are hazard ratios .  ( A coefficient greater than one
indicates that a variable increases the hazard rate of being coeducational ; a coefficient less than one implies that it shrinks the hazard rate .  ) 
43 We know of only one school , Wesleyan College , that began male only , switched to
coeducational status , returned to male only , and later became coeducational ( Potts 1992 )  . 
Colby College began coeducational , created a coordinate women ’ s institution , and later
returned to being coeducational ( Marriner 1963 )  . The decision to switch to coeducational
status here is treated as irreversible . 
402 Journal of Human Capital
The estimates for all single-sex schools ( men ’ s and women ’ s colleges
pooled ) in column 1 indicate that women ’ s colleges persisted as singlesex schools far longer than men ’ s colleges ( had a significantly lower
hazard rate ) conditional on region and other school characteristics . All
three columns of table 5 indicate that private institutions were slower
than public institutions in becoming coeducational . For the initially allmale schools , the land grant institutions were particularly rapid in making the transition to coeducation , whereas technology ( and military ) 
institutions and historically black colleges persisted longer as all-male
institutions . Transitions to coeducational status have been far more rapid
for institutions that opened in the more recent period , and that finding
remains when the sample is limited to institutions founded after 1835 . 
Catholic schools and nonsectarian private institutions were slower to
become coeducational than private single-sex schools having other , 
mainly Protestant , religious affiliations ( e . g .  , Baptist , Lutheran , Methodist ) for both men ’ s and women ’ s colleges . Single-sex schools in the
Midwest ( especially those in the East North Central ) were quicker to
transition to coeducational status than those in other parts of the country . Schools in the South ( especially the South Atlantic ) were the biggest
laggards for men ’ s colleges followed by those in New England and the
Middle Atlantic . Women ’ s colleges in New England were the slowest to
make the transition to coeducational status . 44
The dynamics of transitions from single-sex to coeducational schools
are next examined focusing on the roles of time-varying aggregate factors ( such as wars , changes in attitudes , and macroeconomic conditions ) 
captured by decade dummies and “ competition ” with or “ substitutability ” by existing coeducational schools . We estimate linear probability
models of the transition from single-sex to coeducational schools with
controls for time-invariant institution characteristics , decade dummies , 
and a time-varying state competition variable ( the share of the state
enrollment in coeducational schools at the start of the decade )  . The
basic findings of the linear probability models are similar to those from
probit and logit models . 
The unit of observation is a school-decade , with a 0 for the dependent
variable indicating that a school remained single sex throughout the
decade and a 1 meaning that it switched to coeducation during the
decade . For example , the observation for a single-sex school at the start
of the 1960s would have a 1 for the dependent variable if the school
became coed from 1961 to 1970 and a 0 if it remained single sex at the
start of the next decade ( 1970 )  . 
The full sample covers the 511 initially single-sex schools in the 1934
and 1980 Coeducation College Databases , yielding 3 , 899 school-decade
observations . The regressions include observations for each single-sex
44 Note that although the regressions indicate that the West was slower than the Northeast , New England ( included in the Northeast ) was the slowest . 
College Coeducation from 1835 to the Present 403
school from its opening ( or from 1830 if it opened before 1830 ) to the
decade in which it switched to being coeducational ( or to the 2000s if
it remained single sex by 2010 or to its decade of closure if it closed as
a single-sex school )  . We cluster the standard errors at the state level to
account for the state # year nature of the coeducation competition variable and repeated observations per institution . 45
Table 6 presents the core findings of the linear probability duration
models for all single-sex schools and for men ’ s colleges and women ’ s
colleges separately . We include a full set of census division dummies
and the same controls for time-invariant school characteristics as in table
5 , as well as the coeducational share of state college enrollment . 
The impacts of the time-invariant school characteristics mirror those
in table 5 . A lower transition rate to coeducational status is found for
women ’ s colleges , private colleges , technical institutes , historically black
colleges , and Catholic and nonsectarian schools , and a faster rate is
estimated for land grant schools . For all single-sex colleges and men ’ s
colleges , more competition from coeducational schools in one ’ s state
at the beginning of a decade is associated with a slower transition to
coeducational status ( or greater persistence as a single-sex school )  , suggesting that “ substitutability ” across institutions and product differentiation dominated , perhaps until the late 1960s . The result holds when
the coeducation competition variable is defined as the share of all students in coeducational schools in the state and when it is the share of
public students in coeducational schools in the state . The coeducation
competition variable , however , does not have a detectable effect for the
women ’ s colleges ( table 6 , col . 3 )  . 
The decade coefficients show little evidence of large and distinctive
impacts of the war and recession periods . For men ’ s colleges , the transition rate increases substantially in the 1860s and 1870s ( relative to the
1830s to the 1850s )  , stays at the new higher levels through the 1950s , 
and then jumps in the 1960s and 1970s . That jump is dominated by the
large number of switches concentrated from around 1967 to the early
1970s both for elite schools in the Northeast and for Catholic men ’ s
schools . The time trend for women ’ s colleges shows almost no transition
to coeducation until the 1940s and 1950s and a large increase in the
1960s and 1970s . 
Prior to the 1960s , institutions that switched from single-sex to coeducational status were an idiosyncratic group , whereas after the 1960s
they were mainly in the Northeast or were Catholic . For institutions
outside the Northeast and for those that were not under Catholic control , individual institutional factors , rather than aggregate downturns
and wartime disruptions , were overriding considerations . The switch was
occasionally due to the preference of a college president or a large
benefactor . Religious ideology , particularly in the wake of the Civil War , 
45 The standard errors are similar if one clusters instead by institution .

Note . —The unit of observation is school # decade . All single-sex schools in the 1934 and
1980 Coeducation College Databases are included covering schools present in our 1897 , 
1924 , 1934 , or 1980 institutional samples . The base period is the 1830s and 1840s for cols . 
1 and 2 and the 1830s to the 1900s for col . 3 . The dependent variable is a 1 if the school
switched to coeducational during that decade ( e . g .  , for a school that was single sex in
1960 , a 1 for the dependent variable for the 1960s means that it became coed from 1961
to 1970 , and a 0 means that it remained single sex at the end of the decade or closed
during the decade )  . Schools leave the sample starting in the decade after they become
coeducational . Standard errors are clustered by state . The variable coeducational share
of state enrollment is a time-varying covariate that varies by state and decade . It measures
the share of enrollment in coeducational schools in the institution ’ s state at the start of
the decade . We use 1934 enrollments for the 1830s to 1930s period and 1980 enrollments
for the 1940s to 2000s . There are no land grant and no technical institutions among the
women ’ s colleges . 
College Coeducation from 1835 to the Present 405
played a role for some . And for others , institutional economic distress
was the critical factor . Schools that were commuter institutions , where
residential living was unimportant , made the transition seamlessly . 
By 1960 the surviving male-only institutions were clustered in the
Northeast and were disproportionately Catholic . 46 In 1890 , at the approximate peak of male-only schools in the Midwest , there were 43 , and
just 17 remained by 1960 . In the South , there were 64 at its peak in
1880 , and 25 survived to 1960 . But in the Northeast , where there were
59 at the peak in 1880 , 51 still existed in 1960 . Among the non-Catholic
male-only institutions in the South , there were 58 in 1880 but 16 in
1960 , whereas in the Northeast , 51 existed in 1870 and 36 remained in
1960 . 
In the cases of the Northeast male-only and the Catholic institutions , 
coordination brought about speedy change and can account for the
more rapid conversion in the 1960s and 1970s . The groundwork for
both groups was laid in the 1950s . 
For the Catholic institutions , the Second Vatican Council ( 1962–65 ) 
pronounced that women had the right “ to acquire an education .  .  . 
equal to [ that ] recognized for men ”  ( Poulson 1995 , 122–23 )  . Catholic
colleges , according to trenchant criticisms launched in the mid-1950s , 
could not aspire to be serious research institutions given the narrowness
of their instruction and the limitations of reconciling science with
church teachings . 47 As male-only institutions began to lose their best
men to coeducational institutions , the elite institutions of the Northeast
switched to coeducation , and Catholic schools soon joined that bandwagon . 
The model we propose to understand when institutions would optimally switch from single sex to coeducation emphasized the possibility
of declining quality of students after student demand changed in favor
of coeducation but before institutions made the switch . Although we
cannot measure the quality of the student body for all the institutions
in a consistent manner spanning the long historical period covered by
our sample , we can examine the quantity of students for the period
since 1966 . Single-sex institutions at the upper end of the quality distribution probably did not suffer declining numbers when demand
shifted in favor of coeducation , but less prestigious institutions may have
faced declining enrollments . To examine further the implications of the
framework , table 7 provides estimates of the impact on BA growth of
switching or remaining single sex during various periods for institutions
that opened all male or all female relative to those that opened coeducational . In each case BAs are measured as all BAs , male ( or female ) 
BAs , and all BAs restricted to non-Catholic institutions . 
46 Most of the Catholic institutions that switched before the late 1960s were founded
by the Jesuits or other Catholic missionaries . 47 See Gleason ( 2001 )  , in particular his discussion of Msgr . John Tracy Ellis ’ s biting
criticism of the scholarship and research records of American Catholic higher education .

Source . —BAs by sex for 1966–74 are from Web CASPAR (  )  . 
Other variables are from the 1980 Coeducation College Database ( see the Data Appendix )  . 
Note . —The dependent variable is the growth in BAs ( the change in the log number of
BAs for all BAs , male BAs , female BAs , and those in non-Catholic institutions ) from 1966
to 1974 . The covariates of greatest interest are whether the school was always coeducational , 
became coeducational before 1962 , and switched from 1962 to 1970 , measured relative
to schools that did not switch through 1970 ( the omitted category )  . Protestant denomination includes institutions under any non-Catholic religious control as of 1980 ( or as of
1934 for those that failed before 1980 )  . Standard errors are in parentheses . 
To examine whether schools that were slow to switch to coeducation
suffered losses in enrollments as the demand for coeducation among
undergraduates increased , we estimate the following relationship . We
regress the growth in BAs from 1966 to 1974 ( thus the growth in entering
freshmen from 1962 to 1970 ) on the year in which the school first
opened , the initial 1966 level ( in logs ) of BAs , control of institution , 
region dummies , and whether the school was always coeducational , 
changed before 1962 , or changed from 1962 to 1970 . The omitted
category includes institutions that were not coeducational by 1970 . The
question , therefore , is whether the latecomers—those that became coeducational after 1970—grew slower than the others . 
By measuring the dependent variable as the growth in BAs for all
students , we may overstate the difference between the early switchers
and the others since , in some cases , the trustees ’ condition for the move
to coeducation was that the number of male students never go below
the existing level . For a while that was true for Yale as well as for Dart-
College Coeducation from 1835 to the Present 407
mouth . In these cases , switching from single sex to coeducation increased enrollments by definition . But by restricting the dependent
variable to only males or only females , we would generally understate
the difference by excluding the new group . Therefore , we estimate the
equation both ways . The initial three rows of the table give the effect
on the growth of BAs of changing early versus late , and the other rows
show the estimates for the key control variables . 
We find that institutions that were always coeducational or changed
before 1970 had faster BA growth from 1966 to 1974 than those that
changed after 1970 , if at all . The one instance in which that is less clear
is in column 2 , where the coefficient on switching from 1962 to 1970
for male BAs is smaller and less significant than the others . Institutions
that initially began as all female had the largest percentage decrease in
enrollment if they remained single sex by 1970 ( cols . 4 , 5 , and 6 )  , and
that is true even if one restricts attention to female BAs ( col . 5 )  . A singlesex institution of either gender that remained single sex after 1970 had
lower enrollment growth ( as measured by BAs ) by about 25 log points
during the 8-year period from 1962 to 1970 than one that switched
during those years . 
V . Coeducation and Female Educational Attainment
Currie and Moretti ( 2003 ) provide evidence that an increase in the
number of colleges that women ( born from 1925 to 1975 and turning
25 years old from 1950 to 2000 ) could attend in a county is associated
with greater educational attainment of young women in that area . 48 The
increase in the colleges that women were able to attend by county came
about through new college openings and the switch of single-sex male
colleges to coeducational schools . Thus coeducational institutions of
higher education appear to have mattered to the education of women
in the recent past . 49 But was that also the case as coeducation began to
increase in much of the nation in the 1910s and 1920s ? 
We next explore whether increased access to coeducational institutions played a role in greater female college attainment earlier in the
twentieth century . Even if female-only colleges existed , they would not
have been as numerous as the full group of institutions and thus would
have been less convenient than had coeducation been the norm . And
48 An increase in a woman ’ s education has been shown to improve the life chances of
her offspring , increase the probability that she is married , improve her health , and reduce
her fertility . For references , see Currie and Moretti ( 2003 ) and Oreopoulos and Salvanes 
( 2011 )  . Although these considerations are beyond the scope of this paper , these beneficial
outcomes to individuals and society suggest why the education of women is important
historically and in developing nations today . 49 Our analysis is at the state-cohort level for women born at the start of the twentieth
century . Currie and Moretti ( 2003 ) exploit high-frequency county-level data for more
recent birth cohorts to see if college openings and switching from male only to coeducation
positively affected women ’ s college education . 
408 Journal of Human Capital
most female-only colleges would not have provided as complete and as
high-quality an education as the larger coeducational institutions . These
institutions were , in addition , considerably more expensive than coeducational institutions in the private or public sector during the first half
of the twentieth century . 50
To evaluate the possibility that an increase in coeducational institutions was beneficial to women ’ s education earlier in the twentieth century , we use the eventual educational attainment of a birth cohort , as
gleaned from the U . S . population censuses . We aggregate to birth cohort 
# state of birth cells . The fraction of females in a birth cohort # state
attending college is then regressed on the fraction of undergraduates
in the state who attended a BA-granting coeducational institution of
higher education ( or the fraction of such institutions in the state ) when
the cohort was around 25 years old . Undergraduate data for 1934 are
used to form the weighted enrollment percentages . 
The regressions are estimated two ways :  ( 1 ) with the female attendance rate as the dependent variable and the male college rate as a
separate regressor and ( 2 ) as the ratio of the female to male college
attendance rates . 51 We also add the public high school graduation rate
for females in 1920 or the ratio of the same for females to males . The
reason for its inclusion is that states with better high schools could also
have been those with more coeducational colleges and greater educational attainment more generally . The regressions are weighted by cohort population to reveal the experience of the typical female rather
than the typical state . 52
We focus our empirical work here on the impact that coeducational
college access had on women ’ s college going in the period of the 1910s
and 1920s when coeducation was becoming the norm yet regional variation remained . The regressions in table 8 cover the birth cohorts that
were about 25 years old in 1920 ( and in 1930 )  , the college educations
of which are given by individuals who were 50–59 years old in the 1950 
( and 1960 ) census . In addition , since the enrollment data used to weight
coeducational institutions are for 1934 , these data would best reflect
the experiences of these cohorts . 
The regression results are given in table 8 for cohorts that were about
25 years old in 1920 ( born 1891–1900 ) and 1930 ( born 1901–10 ) and
50 The average annual cost ( tuition , fees , and minimum room and board ) at femaleonly institutions in 1934 was $650 . It was $549 at male-only institutions and $386 for
coeducational institutions ( $239 for publics )  . A female-only college was almost three times
as expensive as a state university . The expenses were greater mainly because these were
costly institutions with lower student / faculty ratios and nicer residential living . 51 We have also estimated the regressions using the female college graduation rate and
the corresponding female to male ratio . The relative magnitudes and significances are
not much different . 52 The use of population weights is also sensible to down-weight low-population states
in the West that had no single-sex institutions and to give less weight to noisier estimates
of state-cohort means derived from smaller samples .

for the two ways of expressing the dependent variable . We find that the
fraction of females who completed some college ( i . e .  , attained more
than 12 years of education ) by the time they were in their 50s , given
the same for males ( or , instead , the ratio of females to males who attended college )  , is positively related to the fraction of institutions in
the state that were coeducational when the cohort was about 25 years
old . Similarly , these two dependent variables are also related to the
fraction of individuals who attended coeducational institutions in the
state when the cohort was about 25 years old . The coefficients of interest
suggest that a one-standard-deviation increase in the fraction of institutions in the state that were coeducational would increase the female
to male college attendance rate by around 11–15 percent without including the public high school graduation rate and by around 5–8 percent including it . 
The relationship we estimate mainly reflects differences across
regions , as can be seen in the example given by figure 5 . In the states
of the Northeast , coeducation rates were low , and women had college
attendance rates that were considerably lower than men ’ s . The South
College Coeducation from 1835 to the Present 411
generally had somewhat higher coeducation rates and also higher relative college attendance rates for women . In the Midwest and West , in
contrast , the fraction of institutions that were coeducational and the
fraction of students in them were exceptionally high . In consequence , 
women achieved higher levels of college attendance relative to men . 
The states of the Northeast had somewhat higher levels of college education for males , but it was the states of the West that had the highest
levels for men and for women as well . 
Some states , generally the smaller ones west of the Mississippi , had
no single-sex colleges because their populations were so sparse that their
primary or only higher education institutions were coeducational and
were in the public sector . These states form somewhat of a cloud in
terms of the relationship between coeducation and women ’ s college
rates . Because they are small states , the population-weighting procedure
reduces their impact in the table 8 regressions . 
VI . Coda : The End of In Loco Parentis and the Beginnings of True
Coeducational Equality
By the 1970s the vast majority of female and male undergraduates were
educated in coeducational institutions . The fraction female among all
undergraduates was rising and would hit the equality mark around 1980 . 
Gender differences in college majors had begun to narrow . But what
about the selection of women into institutions that were once male only ? 
Higher educational institutions that today admit students in a nondiscriminatory fashion , with regard to sex , disability , and need , did not
always select students in a gender-blind fashion . 53
Many institutions that were once male only gave preference to men
in admissions when they initially became coeducational . In some cases 
( e . g .  , Dartmouth , Yale ) the preference was due to mandates that were
set down by the trustees as a condition for the admission of women 
( Karabel 2005 )  . But in other cases the preference was partly due to
dormitory limitations for women at residential institutions . Some of
these institutions had coordinate women ’ s colleges or related institutions ( e . g .  , Radcliffe and Harvard ) that had been kept small . In other
cases , the fraction female among students was kept down by other factors 
( e . g .  , Cornell University and Stanford University )  , including the lumpiness and fixed costs of building residential halls . 
But if men and women could occupy the same residential areas , admissions in many institutions could be gender blind . That began to
happen in the late 1960s with the end of in loco parentis regulations in
many colleges and universities . 
The end of in loco parentis regulations meant that women no longer
53 Interestingly , there are examples of institutions that once became gender blind but
have recently given preference to male applicants to even out the sex distribution . 
412 Journal of Human Capital
had curfews . With no restrictions on hours , universities no longer had
to monitor them in dormitories and students could live off campus . In
institutions with required residential living , male and female students
could occupy the same dormitories and even share the same bathrooms . 54 The end of residential restrictions on some campuses meant
that admissions could be gender blind . 55
VII . Summary and Conclusions
Colleges in America accepted women into coeducational settings beginning around 1835 . Institutions that were established as coeducational
colleges increased in an almost unbroken pace from that time to the
present . In a similar fashion , institutions that were founded as male only
switched to coeducational status in a fairly continuous manner with the
conversion of Oberlin in 1837 until the 1960s , when the rate of switching
greatly increased . 
We have sought the reasons for the switch from male-only or femaleonly to coeducational status for institutions offering 4-year undergraduate degrees . Many of the aggregate factors that have been regarded
as potentially important do not appear to have mattered greatly for the
precise timing of institutional switching . Neither war nor aggregate economic factors accelerated the rate of change for the total group . Timeinvariant aspects of the institution , such as the type of control , the
religious group that founded it , and the opening year of the institution , 
were important in determining when each of the originally single-sex
institutions became coeducational . 
The general continuity of change before the 1960s appears due to
the fact that institutions were affected by a host of idiosyncratic factors
striking them in different years . The same appears to have been the
case for the founding of coeducational institutions . 
We have also examined whether the increase in institutions that accepted women and taught them in coeducational classes mattered to
their educational attainment . Evidence for the more recent period from
Currie and Moretti ( 2003 ) indicates that increasing the number of institutions that admit women increases the schooling of women in the
geographic area . Our analysis of data for the 1910s and 1920s supports
the notion that greater accessibility of coeducational college opportu54 Goldin conducted a small survey of residential colleges and universities . The responses
reveal that most lifted hours restrictions from upper-class women from 1966 to 1968 , 
shifted to no hours for all women from 1968 to 1970 , and introduced coeducational
dormitories beginning around 1969 , although some were earlier . Collecting information
on residential living arrangements was difficult because of a lack of institutional memory
regarding mundane student issues . 55 At Harvard , e . g .  ,  “ houses ” were coeducational on an experimental basis in 1971 and
thereafter formally . The admission of men and women became gender blind and was
done by the same committee around 1975 . Prior to 1975 the relative number of women
to men was increased , but admissions were not gender blind . 
College Coeducation from 1835 to the Present 413
nities in a state increased women ’ s college enrollments and , thus , their
eventual educational attainment . 
Schools founded earlier , thus having larger alumni support , switched
later . The demand for coeducation by students increased , probably beginning in the 1950s , and by the 1960s the only force holding coeducation in check was alumni ( and alumnae ) support for retaining the
prior gender identity of the school . For the celebrated period of change
in the late 1960s and early 1970s , institutions that switched early or were
always coeducational increased enrollments faster than those that
switched later , if at all . Declining quality of male students at the top
elite institutions in the 1960s led to an almost complete collapse of the
single-sex system . 
The changes that occurred beginning in the late 1960s were important , but focusing on them exclusively omits the long history of coeducation in the United States . Coeducation mattered to women ’ s education throughout U . S . history , and it mattered to a greater extent in
the more distant past than in the more recent and celebrated period
of change . 
Data Appendix
Coeducation College Database
A . 1934 Coeducation College Database
The three sources are Annual Reports of the Department of the Interior for .  .  . 1897 
( Department of the Interior , Commissioner of Education 1898 )  ; the Biennial
Survey of Education , 1922–24 ( U . S . Office of Education 1927 )  ; and the Biennial
Survey of Education , 1932–34 ( U . S . Office of Education 1937 )  . 
Each of the three sources contains relatively similar information on the number of students in various groups ( e . g .  , by sex ; by level such as preparatory , 
undergraduate , and graduate ; by type such as collegiate and professional ) and
revenue sources ( e . g .  , student fees , government grants , private gifts )  . Total revenues do not include additions to endowment , which are listed separately . Students exclude those in summer school , correspondence courses , extension , and
military drill .  ( Institution-level data , similar to those we have used , are also
available in printed form for most years from 1890 to 1938 .  ) 
The sample was originally collected for Goldin and Katz ( 1999 ) and has been
added to and altered to study coeducation . In the original sample , the 1934
data set included 853 institutions , 711 privately controlled and 142 publicly
controlled . That for 1924 had 790 , with 677 private and 113 public . In 1897 , 
there were 534 universities and colleges and an additional 287 professional , 
theological , and technical schools not connected to any of those on the original
list . The final 1897 sample contains 821 institutions , of which 717 were private
and 104 public . 
In the 1934 Coeducation College Database , only BA-granting institutions are
included and dedicated professional and theological schools are generally ex-
414 Journal of Human Capital
cluded . These data set restrictions reduce the original number of institutions
to 443 in 1897 , 631 in 1924 , and 704 in 1934 . A total of 769 institutions are
included , of which 10 are “ coordinate ” institutions ( see below )  . 
When possible , we did not include institutions that were junior colleges in
the survey year ; separately listed independent teaching colleges and normal
schools were also not included . In 1897 , a list of “ colleges for women , division
B ” contained some that continued as BA-granting institutions , and these have
been included . More than a hundred of these institutions , however , were probably not real colleges at the time and were not found in later surveys . They
have , therefore , been omitted in the analyses . The dedicated professional and
theological institutions that did not grant BAs are omitted . It should be noted
that a BA-granting institution in 1934 may not have granted a BA before 1897 , 
even though our data set will include the institution from its opening date . 
The 1924 listing contains the “ date at first opening ,  ” which can differ slightly
from the date of founding . We checked these dates against the date of first
instruction in American Council on Education ( 1960 )  . We linked the 1924
schools to those in 1934 and used several other guides , such as The College Blue
Book ( Hurt and Hurt 1933 ) and Songe ( 1978 )  , for the histories of institutions
that changed city or name or merged with or split off from others . Of the 790
schools in 1924 , 695 were linked to institutions on the 1934 list . Among those
that were not theological seminaries and independent professional schools in
1924 , the linkage rate was 91 . 5 percent . 
Except in the case of the historically black institutions , we were able to find
virtually all—if not all—publicly controlled institutions known to have existed
in each of the three years : 1897 , 1924 , and 1934 . In both 1897 and 1924 , many
of the publicly controlled , historically black institutions of today were not listed , 
although some were . We have traced the histories of these institutions and believe
that they were omitted because they were , correctly , categorized as teaching
colleges or industrial institutes . We used the historical information in American
Council on Education ( 1960 ) for our institutional categorization and were
helped by the contemporaneous information in The College Blue Book ( 1933 )  . 
There are some anomalies ( e . g .  , Rutgers University )  , and these are coded as
they were in 1934 . 
The coeducation date variable was added to the institutions in the 1897 , 1924 , 
and 1934 data set in the following manner . We defined a coeducational institution as one that had classes for men and women together . These classes had
to include the central ones in a liberal arts college and could not be limited to
the educational school , for example . We began with lists of coeducational dates
created by several other scholars including Janet Currie and Louis Galambos . 
The majority of our institutions were not on these lists , and we obtained those
dates using a host of materials . In many cases the date on which an institution
became coeducational was clear . Many of the public institutions , for example , 
opened as coeducational colleges and universities . But in some cases there was
ambiguity , and we used our best sense for when the majority of women ( or
men ) could take courses on an equal basis with the men ( or women )  . The date
on which an institution that opened single sex became coeducational ranges
from 1835 to 2008 . 
Ten schools reported having a significant number of undergraduate women
enrolled in 1934 even though these were male-only institutions at the time . 
Some of the institutions had true “ coordinate ” women ’ s colleges ( e . g .  , Brown
College Coeducation from 1835 to the Present 415
and Pembroke )  . In other cases , and these are mainly Catholic colleges and
universities , women were admitted to a few undergraduate programs , such as
teaching and nursing . We added these true- or pseudo-coordinate institutions
to the 1934 data and omitted the women ’ s undergraduate numbers from the
male-only institutions . 
B . 1980 Coeducation College Database
We expanded the data set through time by linking the institutions that existed
in 1934 to the IPEDS . Institutions that were in the IPEDS but not in the 1934
data were those that opened after 1934 . Some institutions merged after 1934 , 
and we linked both previous institutions to the new one . We attached FICE
codes to the 1934 schools to link the 1980 enrollment figures to the original
data set . 
The first issue was to match institutions from 1934 to the IPEDS . To maximize
the probability of matching a school in the 1934 survey to the IPEDS , we appended the 1980 , 1987 , 1997 , and 2000–2007 IPEDS surveys ( see http :  /  / 
nces . ed . gov / ipeds / datacenter /  )  . The institutions were merged on the basis of
name , city , and state . The matches suggested by the algorithm were checked
since some institutions changed city and some even changed state . In various
cases institutional information was checked on the institution ’ s Web site to make
certain that our match was correct . Of the 769 schools in the original data set , 
717 were matched . Those that did not match either closed between 1934 and
1980 , were music conservatories that are not included in the IPEDS , or had
expired before 1934 ( but were included in 1924 )  . An additional 766 institutions
that opened after 1934 were added to the original data set . 
The addition of the 766 institutions to the 1934 list meant that we needed to
know when these institutions became coeducational if they opened as a singlesex institution . We used data on BA degrees awarded by sex in 1966 ( from NCES
CASPAR )  , the first year available . Our algorithm was that if 95 percent or greater
of an institution ’ s degrees went to individuals of a particular sex , we identified
the school as single sex . If a school appeared to be single sex in 1966 but was
listed as coed in 1980 , we examined online information about the school to
learn when it opened and when it went coed . We did not gather information
on the opening dates of the institutions that opened after 1934 because a comprehensive list is not available .
