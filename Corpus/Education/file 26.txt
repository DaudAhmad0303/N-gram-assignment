This country just dropped all Covid restrictions . Hear from their health minister 
( CNN ) Students across the country are making the transition to an online format to finish out the school year . It may seem like a mini vacation to some but for others , their workload just got a bit harder . 

Several universities and public and private schools decided to close their campuses to stop the spread of the coronavirus . 
While students are preparing or going through the shift in learning environments , they ' re sharing their experiences on TikTok , the popular short video social media app . 
Here ' s a look at what a few of their academic lives look like right now :  
 ' I didn ' t pay all this tuition money to sit on my floor ' 
Syera Plitt is a freshman at the University of Southern California and a dance major at the Glorya Kaufman School of Dance . She ' s been taking online courses for the past three days .  
 " Normally I ' m in the studios almost all day being physically active ,  " she told CNN .  " I alternate daily between about three hours of rehearsals on some days or improvisation and conditioning classes on other days .  " 
The campus officially put students on Zoom , an online video conference service .  
 " It has made all of my classes less active ,  " she said .  " My classmates and I are confined to limited amounts of space ( dorms , hallways , outdoors , etc .  ) where we can ' t physically do what we normally do . We meet with our professors online for modified classes .  " 
Plitt is concerned this will affect her grades and performances that were scheduled for April .  
 " My major requires my classmates and I to congregate ,  " she said .  " We kind of have to be together to rehearse , learn and perform with each other . If we don ' t get our allotted rehearsal time we won ' t be ready to perform , and there is a good chance my performances will either be canceled or postponed .  " 
Plitt said she feels bad for seniors whose projects are required to be finished and performed in order for them to graduate .  
 " Our performances are graded , our finals are active , so I ' m not sure what they ( the university ) will do to combat that .  " she said .  " It ' s also money wasting . This is more of a university issue , but I didn ' t pay all this tuition money to sit on my floor and barely move . But at this point it ' s out of our hands .  " 
Film students halt production
Camryn Brescia is a film student at New York University and made a TikTok of her professor giving her online class a song break in between lessons . 
The song break video came out of a general education class that ' s supposed to have 300 students in it , she said . And yet , her professors have made the lectures more personal and fun .

 " Online classes as a film student have been quite strange ,  " she told CNN .  " As my classes are either production related or large discussions about film we ' ve watched together , it ' s pretty difficult to do over what is essentially a giant FaceTime .  " 
Brescia , a commuter student , said her classes at NYU switched to an online format Wednesday . She said her production class is posing a challenge .  
 " It ' s extremely hard to get the full experience since the class is extremely hands-on ,  " she said .  " We ' re set to make a few short films for the class before the semester ends and NYU has halted all production of that till further notice so it ' s been rather disappointing for the film kids .  " 
Preparing to go online-only
Trevor Patchen , a high school senior in Warren , Ohio , told CNN students were sent an online survey assessing the connectivity of each household on March 11 .

Patchen said online classes will start Tuesday .  
 " Friday was the first day off of school since the governor instituted the three-week close yesterday ,  " he said .  " What it looks like we ' re doing is having online assignments through Google Classroom and Renweb . We ' re also using Remind to set up notifications about work .  " 
If students or families don ' t have reliable access to the tools they need to complete assignments , Patchen said the school notice stated arrangements can be made on a case-by-case basis . 
Will there be more cheating on exams ? 
Tia Stamp-Querry , an engineering freshman at James Madison University in Harrisonburg , Virginia , posted a video on TikTok about the struggle of remembering all the math lessons she learned in class .  
 " It ' s going to be hard for some like in math ,  " Stamp-Querry told CNN .  " Getting questions answered is going to be hard .  " 
Tia Stamp-Querry &  # 39 ; s TikTok about the difficulty of remembering math lessons throughout the year .

Stamp-Querry has four classes on her plate . She said professors told her all of the exams and quizzes will be online now , with some professors posting video lessons and others wanting to try a FaceTime-like platform .  
 " I ' m sure the professors aren ' t happy with the amount of cheating that ' s going to go on with online exams and quizzes ,  " she said .  " We aren ' t starting until March 26 because many professors weren ' t fully prepared for this .  " 
Though she hasn ' t officially transitioned she said some of her classes already give out online homework . The only difference now will be that exams will be given online , too . 
Stamp-Querry said it ' s stressful and she knows her peers are upset about not seeing their friends , but she ' s a bit relieved .  
 " I was in the middle of a project that was killing me and now it ' s canceled ,  " she said .  " I can relax and I already do most of my assignments online so it won ' t be much of a change . The only real change will be the lectures and the exams online .  " 
FaceTiming into graduation
Nora Alghazaly studies behavioral and biological sciences at the University of Michigan . She lives at home and not in the dorms , so she wasn ' t forced to pack up and head home as a result of the university ' s closure .  
 " As of right now our professors are working very hard to transition our courses to an online format for the remainder of the semester , which is until April 17 ,  " Alghazaly told CNN .  " We are patiently waiting to hear back from them and hopefully begin this transition on the 16th of Monday .  " 
As a senior expecting to graduate in May , she made a TikTok joking about FaceTiming into her college graduation with her parents and grandmother in the background . 
Alghazaly &  # 39 ; s parents and grandmother appeared in her TikTok about FaceTiming into graduation . 
Alghazaly ' s parents and grandmother appeared in her TikTok about FaceTiming into graduation .  
 " Grandma with the harmal / sage because she thinks that ' s the cure for this virus ,  " she wrote on her video . 
With regard to her graduation itself , Alghazaly said she isn ' t worried and she made the TikTok video for laughs .  
 " I ' m hoping that America has this together and will resolve this issue fairly quickly ,  " she said .  " My worries are with the ones who are facing hardships during these times .  " 
Uncharted territory
Sharnelia Johnson teaches seventh- and eighth-graders in the South Bronx in New York City . Her school closed Friday , a few hours before she made a video about how she ' s handling being a teacher during coronavirus .  
 " I ' m glad we closed , she told CNN .  " I want my students to be safe and not susceptible to this virus .  " 
In the video , which was meant to be funny , Johnson can be seen wearing gloves as she interacts with her students . As students approach her for a high five she can be seen practicing social distancing .  
 " We are teaching from online now ,  " she said .  " Which is something I know 99% of us have never done before .  " 
Johnson said her school surveyed students and equipped everyone with laptops before the school canceled classes . 
Practice for the future
Ari Green is a high school senior at The Frisch School in Paramus , New Jersey , and told CNN his experience with his online classes has been great so far . 
Green ' s virtual day consists of six classes from 10 a . m . to 2 : 35 p . m . His first day of formal classes was Thursday and they will extend through next week . He said his classes consist of 16-25 kids .

 " Going to a physical school my whole academic life , I was unsure how it would work out ,  " he said .  " But the school administration is forward thinking and the teachers have been fantastic working through this very sensitive time .  " 
Green posted a video to TikTok asking his teacher if he could use the restroom with the caption ,  " Virtual classes be like .  " In the video , his teacher responds by laughing and saying " Do you have to ask me that here ? Go get out of here .  "  
 " Strictly being on a screen could obviously be distracting , but this is good practice for when I ' m working in the future and have meetings online ,  " he said .  " Thankfully the teachers are well organized and are able to keep the students engaged .  "
