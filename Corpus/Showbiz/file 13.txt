Sustainable fashion 
- the continuously 
evolving trend toward fashion and design 
embracing broader issues of sustainability in 
production and consumption 
- is a segment 
of the fashion industry that has not been 
systemically reported on.
The Sustainable Fashion Blueprint 2018 
report was created to (1) briefly review the 
impact that the fashion industry has on the 
environment and society, and gauge 
consumers’ perception of the fashion 
industry, (2) highlight the varying definitions 
of sustainable fashion, (3) summarize the 
existing sustainable business initiatives and 
the positive and negative impact each can 
have on the environment and society, and (4) 
outline action items for businesses and 
consumers that want to change the impact 
they have on the environment and society. 
This report broadly conveys fashion’s 
footprint in the global economy and the 
environment.
To accomplish this, the report relies on 
qualitative and quantitative analysis, drawing 
on primary and secondary research, 
including the Mamoq Fashion Survey.
This report was created during the authors’ 
University of Cambridge MBA program as 
part of the Social Innovation Special Interest 
Group student initiative and in collaboration 
with Mamoq, a sustainable fashion 
marketplace.

THE APPAREL 
INDUSTRY: 
AN OVERVIEW
Goa, India, Dec2005

An important actor for society
The oldest known fashion item dates back 130,000 years 2
.
Since then, fashion - beyond practicalities - has become a visual 
expression of identity. The industry’s dual role of differentiation and 
assimilation allows individuals to express their differences, while 
empowering them to claim their belonging to a group, a culture or a 
movement.
Globalized, complex and competitive
An early actor of globalization, the TCLF sector is characterized by a 
“winner take all” intense competition and by a discount culture 3
, 
which both engender a race to the bottom on margins. Despite 
technological advances, margins are further stressed by a complex 
supply chain with countless intermediaries.
“It is not uncommon for some producers of shoes and apparel 
to have more than 1,000 suppliers scattered across several 
dozen countries.” 4
Fulfilling a sophisticated demand
Technology and the rise of e-commerce paved the way for more 
sophisticated consumers, increased demand for personalization, and 
instant gratification expectations. The increased competition in supply 
meets an increased and more influential customer demand leading to an 
ever-growing complexification and frequency of fashion cycles
constantly pushing demand and production upwards.
“The Textile, Clothing, Leather and 
Footwear (TCLF) sector is 
characterized by geographically 
dispersed production and rapid 
market-driven changes, providing 
employment opportunities to 
millions of workers worldwide 
especially for young women. Due 
to the scale and the profile of 
workers employed, the sector 
offers great potential to contribute 
significantly to economic and 
social development.”

Global Outlook

Sustainable Fashion Blueprint 2018

World’s 7th largest economy
In 2016, the global TCLF industry was a €1 trillion market which would 
make it the 7th largest economy on the planet 5,7,8
.
With over €200 billion turnover, the sector was twice as big as the 
computer and electronics sector 9
. It is the one of the biggest 
manufacturing sector in Europe 10 and represents 40% of all 
manufacturing jobs in South Asia 11
.
Labor intensive
The fashion industry employs over 300 million people across the value 
chain 5
; almost the population of the United States, as of December 31, 
2017. The sector is often a crucial source of employment and a big 
GDP contributor for emerging as well as developed economies. Though 
many individuals around the world may work within the same sector, 
globally, there does exist a disparity between the wages, working 
conditions, workers’ rights, and gender-specific treatments offered to 
manufacturing employees.
2nd most polluting industry
Over 350,000 km2 6 of land - roughly the size of Germany - is 
dedicated to cotton production alone. 
An estimated 93 billion m3 of water - enough for 5 million people to 
survive - is used by the industry every year 5,12
. 
Around ½ million tons of microfiber 5 or the equivalent of 3 million 
barrels of oil 13 is dumped in the ocean every year, nearly the same 
amount as the DeepWater Horizon spill 14

SUSTAINABILITY 
IN FASHION
SUSTAINABILITY: 
THE INDEFINABLE 2018 CONCEPT
Sustainability is gaining traction in 
the fashion world. Consumers, 
particularly Millennials and 
Generation Zs, are becoming 
increasingly aware of the challenges 
of sustainability, leading to changes 
in shopping habits and expectations 
for better, more sustainable 
products and new ways of 
consuming fashion 15. This is 
creating an area of differentiation
for companies that attempt to 
address these changes through 
identifying more sustainable ways to 
work across their product’s whole life 
cycle. According to the Cotton 
Council International and Cotton 
Incorporated Global Environment 
Survey, sustainability is a high 
priority for consumers in countries 
such as, India (81 percent), Mexico 
(69 percent), Italy (62 percent), 
and China (60 percent) 16. However, 
the increased awareness of 
sustainability in the fashion world 
has yet to lead to a universal 
definition of sustainable fashion. 
Consumers and fashion 
professionals alike are identifying 
what sustainable fashion means for 
him or herself. For Andrea Sanabria 
Oviedo, the founder of La Petite
Mort, “Sustainable fashion is a 
concept still evolving so it’s hard, 
even now, to make a unanimous 
definition. To me, it’s about values, 
whether it’s linked to animal rights, 
environmental impact, consumption 
habits or social development. 
You don’t have to be all of them (I 
don’t think it’s even possible) but 
each one of these are an aspect of 
sustainable fashion aiming towards 
the same goal: to make a more 
human and responsible industry.” 
For the purposes of this report,
sustainable fashion will be a similar 
comprehensive concept of 
environmental and socioeconomic values as defined by 
the founders of Mamoq, a 
sustainable fashion marketplace. CopenhagenFashion

“Sustainable fashion broadly 
refers to the design, production, 
distribution, consumption, and 
disposal of apparel with respect 
and consideration for the health 
and longevity of our natural 
environment, and the welfare of 
the animals and humans involved. 
It aims to limit the socioenvironmental cost of fashion, 
while maximizing its lifetime value 
and positive impact.” 
Madeline Petrow and Lenny Leemann - founders of Mamoq
12VALUES TO CREATE POSITIVE 
AND SUSTAINABLE CHANGE
NATURAL MATERIAL
Brands are committed to working with natural, bio-degradable 
materials such as cotton, linen, or wool. At least 95% of the 
entire collection is made from these materials.
CYCLED
Brands use recycled or 
up-cycled materials 
instead of raw, virgin 
materials. This limits the 
environmental impact of 
production, reduces 
landfill waste, and 
inspires creativity.
ARTISAN CRAFT
Brands work directly with 
highly skilled artisans and 
craftsmen. Artisans help to 
keep skills, technique, and 
culture alive through their 
craft.
ECO-CONSCIOUS
Brands demonstrate an active 
commitment to limit their 
negative environmental impact 
and reduce their carbon 
footprint.
VEGAN
Brands are committed to 
animal-free production.
THIRD PARTY 
CERTIFIED
Brands have been 
thoroughly vetted, and 
officially verified by a third 
party organization (e.g., 
Fairtrade and Oeko-Tex).
GIVES BACK
Brands consistently give back 
and demonstrate an ongoing 
commitment to charitable 
activity. This includes the “buy 
to give” model, as well as 
financial donation.
TRANSPARENT
Brands operate on a fully 
transparent and traceable 
supply chain. This promotes 
accountability of production 
and higher ethical standards.
HANDMADE
Brands offer a collection 
that is unique and made 
by hand with care.
MADE IN EUROPE
Brands produce and 
manufacture within 
Europe. This supports 
local industries and 
limits the environmental 
impact of large global 
supply chains.
ORGANIC
Brands work with 
materials grown without 
the use of toxic 
chemicals or pesticides. 
This helps to limit the 
negative impact of 
farming on our 
ecosystems and personal 
health.
ECONOMIC 
EMPOWERMENT
Brands create job 
opportunity and skills 
training for marginalized 
communities. This 
facilitates financial 
independence, and offers a 
source of sustainable 
economic development.

WHY ADOPT 
SUSTAINABLE FASHION
BUSINESSES’ LIMITATIONS
Increasing raw material costs, heightening reputational 
risk, and shifting consumer demands are challenging fashion 
companies to redefine their long-term strategies. 
EMPOWERED CONSUMERS
Connected consumers are exposed to more fashion choices than 
ever before. Technology has empowered them to demand more 
transparency, accountability, and quality.
NEW VALUE PROPOSITIONS
Sustainable fashion initiatives are at the core of a new category 
of “positive impact” new actors in the fashion sector. These 
initiatives also help existing businesses manage costs, minimize
reputational risk, diversify revenue streams, and address
consumer expectations.
NEW CONSUMER HABITS
Sustainable fashion initiatives can help consumers, especially Millennials 
and Generation Zs, with lower disposable income than their parents to 
gain easy access to ethically-made apparel from a transparent production 
line. These initiatives can also educate consumers on the importance of 
sustainability, and show that sustainable fashion can be of good quality, 
affordable and diverse.

In order to implement sustainable 
fashion principles, incumbents will 
need to make long-term 
commitments and investments 
while new entrants will face high 
barriers to entry and scalability 
challenges. Transparency will 
become key to a company’s 
success in the industry and 
currently stands as the biggest 
technical challenge to overcome.
Until recently, the fashion industry’s incumbents considered sustainability to be a 
source of overhead for their companies. Measures of sustainability were only 
implemented to meet regulations, uphold brand image, and match the competition. 
Fashion houses set off to sponsor and run costly stand-alone neutral impact 
programs aimed at offsetting the perceived environmental and social impact of 
their core activity. 
Since then, the industry has come to re-assess the potential value-add of 
sustainability and the gains sustainable fashion initiatives can yield for a business 
when embedded directly at the core of the company’s value proposition and 
consistently throughout the company’s supply chain. When choosing to implement 
such principles, an incumbent will face at least 3 types of challenges. First, an 
incumbent needs to make a long-term commitment to sustainable fashion 
principles which will involve dedicating a budget, headcount and time across the 
organization for a long-term implementation of sustainable initiatives. Second, 
management has to be aware that implementing such principles will have a direct 
impact on margins 17
, which the incumbent will adapt to by adopting new business 
practices and services (cf. previous pages). Third, the corporate governance 
structure of the company will be challenged as agency issues arise. As such, the 
corporate governance strategy should be reviewed to factor in success measures on 
sustainability and favor long-term sustainability initiatives. 
New entrants, who choose to implement sustainable fashion initiatives from the 
onset, will face a different set of challenges. These entrants often start as small 
players on local markets and face high barriers to entry when it comes to 
national and international markets, especially as they compete on prices and brand 
recognition with big established brands. E-commerce and social media will have 
an important role in lowering those barriers.
Finally, for both incumbents and new entrants, the biggest challenges of all will 
be transparency. Supply chain in the industry is always extremely complex and it 
will be challenging for both incumbents and new entrants to establish and maintain a 
transparent and trusted supply chain. Here, people look towards technology and the 
promises of AI and blockchain to tackle those issues. Collaboration between actors, 
open-sourcing and certification will also be key to the successful adoption of 
sustainable fashion principles.

“Transparency alone does not 
represent the sort of structural, 
systemic change we would like to 
see for the fashion industry - but it 
helps us get there. Transparency 
helps to reveal the structures in 
place so we can better 
understand how to change them. 
Transparency shines a light on 
issues often kept in the dark. It is 
an important first step towards 
positive change.”

FOR SUSTAINABILITY
ACTION ITEM CHECKLIST
1. GET YOUR COMPANY AND CUSTOMERS 
ON-BOARD*
Sustainability is seen by certain 
consumers as an add-on. Your company 
can educate consumers on what 
sustainability can be and dispel 
prejudices against sustainable fashion.
Open a dialog with customers to 
understand their aspirations and 
commit to meeting their aspirations via 
sustainable initiatives. Social platforms 
provide a cost-effective medium to 
broadcast your message and listen to 
customer reactions. 
Join industry initiatives, network and 
partner with other actors on 
sustainable projects, and learn by 
example from early adopters. Look 
beyond your industry, leverage the 
expertise of sustainability and circular 
economy experts who will guide you. 3

Sustainable Fashion Blueprint 2018
2. DEDICATE RESOURCES*
Allocate resources to create and 
implement the company’s sustainable 
principles. These principles can be 
addressed by, but not limited to, 
designing waste out of your supply 
chain, adopting new business and 
distribution models, and staying on top 
of the latest innovations.
Businesses can choose from three 
different structures to ensure the 
resources dedicated will be used 
efficiently: a separate department or 
team, a separate entity, or a joint 
venture between the company and 
other industry actors.
* Refer to Annex 2 for a list of initiatives, organizations, or ethical marketplaces that supports this action item. 42
* Refer to Annex 2 for a list of initiatives, organizations, or ethical marketplaces that supports this action item. 3. COMMIT TO TRANSPARENCY*
Create an environment where 
transparency is a key goal. If 
necessary, pledge to this goal with 
other industry actors 19
. 
Quantitative metrics of the company’s 
environmental and socio
-economic 
issues can be tracked and published, 
both within the company and publicly. 
The company can also request similar 
transparency from others in its supply 
chain. Internally, these metrics should 
be used to measure progress on 
sustainability goals. The company 
should aim for continuous improvement 
in the metrics and use its 
measurements to identify areas for 
improvement. Externally, easily 
accessible metrics (e.g. maintenance 
tips or post
-purchase indications) 
through a mobile app or another 
medium would allow consumers to see 
the company’s commitment to the 
issues, and to better understand the 
social and environmental impact of 
their purchase. 
4
.
ENCOURAGE INITIATIVES*
Foster sustainable initiatives both in
-
house and externally. 
Internally, strive for transparent and 
fair working conditions (e.g. fair 
wages, health and work
-life balance 
programs) for any workforce 
contributing to your supply chain and 
create employee incentives to 
encourage the entire organization to 
actively seek sustainable 
improvements. 
Externally, partner with innovative 
start
-ups that can help guide or further 
your sustainable initiatives. 
Crowdsource and nurture innovative 
problem solving by sponsoring design 
challenges and engaging young talent 
to solve the most intricate challenges 
of sustainable fashion. 
Take inspiration from the open
-source 
initiative in the software industry and 
adopt an open
-source policy with your 
sustainability and supply chain data. 
This open
-source policy will spread 
through the complex supply chain and, 
by capillarity, improve transparency in 
the industry.

SHORT TERM
1 . BE A CONCIOUS CONSUMER
Do your research on how the fashion 
industry impacts society on a 
environmental and socio-economic 
level. Being aware and informed will 
help you determine what impact you 
want to have on the environment and 
society.
6. EDUCATE AND LEARN FROM OTHERS
Share your tips and interests with your

Review clothing labels and take the 
information collected into consideration 
– Where was the garment made (e.g., 
locally)? Is the apparel made of natural 
fibers (e.g., cotton, tencel, and wool)? 
Will the apparel require significant 
washing or is it dry cleaning only?
4. QUESTION YOUR NEEDS
Avoid impulse buys – Learn how to 
distinguish between need and want and 
buy clothing only when needed.
8. FIND NEW SOURCES OF CLOTHING*
Shop at brand-specific clothing stores, 
vintage shops, ethical marketplaces, 
and rental clothing stores.
