outrage from the public .

Life began to move ahead and 
fast . The fashion silhouette at 
this time was straight up and

knees were 
rouged . Silk 
stockings were 
the rage ; they 
were rolled 
down just 
above the 
knee . 
The “ Thinking 
Woman ” was 
college 
educated and 
considered 
herself to be 
the opposite of 
the flapper .

World War II ( 1939-1945 ) effects fashion directly in this time 
period . 
L85 was a law which restricted the manufacture of clothing . 
Ruffles were forbidden . Only one pocket per blouse or shirt was 
allowed . Hems could be no deeper than 2 inches and the widest 
part of the hem of a dress could not exceed 72 inches . Hemlines 
rose and leveled off just below the knee . 
For men several things were removed : cuffs , vests , 2 pant suits , 
patch pockets , cloth belts , and pleats . 
War Restrictions / Clothing
Stockings , which were not 
required under pants , were 
expensive and usually not 
available . Women in this 
picture are shown painting 
their legs to appear to have 
nylons on . 
Not only fashion was 
restricted but food was 
rationed . Manufacturing of 
clothing stopped until the 
end of the war
1940 ’ s
With the fashion industry closed down by the war 
in Europe , the U . S . was left to its own designers 
for fashion direction . The designers turned to the 
military for inspiration . 
The Eisenhower jacket made fashion history as it 
was adopted for civilian use . Large rectangular 
shoulders . The shoulders were roomy and 
comfortable . 
The “ bomber jacket ” was based on the Air Corps 
flying coat made of leather with knit wrist cuffs to 
keep out the wind . It was usually lined with 
alpaca fur . 
The Montgomery beret was the inspiration for 
hats . 
Elastic could not be used so a close fitting hat 
was the sensible choice . 
40 ’ s Inverted Triangle , broad 
shoulders & Thin hips
Women began to wear pants as he practical 
dress for work in industry . It was not too 
long before pants were popular outside the 
workplace as a comfortable casual fashion . 
The fashion at this time was very manly and 
the fabric was sensible tweed . 
The shoulder was square , wide and padded . 
Suit dresses were very popular . 
Saddle stitching was a favorite trim . 
Men wore colors reflecting the time : khaki 
and other muted colors . 
The New Look
In 1947 , a French designer , Christian Dior launched 
what he called “ The New Look .  ” The war was over , 
the men had returned home . 
The New Look gave women a softer , more feminine 
look and curve . This look was stylish , elegant , and 
reflected the opposite of wartime restrictions . 
The hemlines fell to just above he ankle and skirts 
were incredibly full . Yards and yards of fabric were 
used as well as petticoats with crinoline and flounces 
of lace . 
The shoulder pad was dropped with a thud and the 
sloping , soft shoulder replaced the squared , manly 
look . The bust line was accented ; the waistline was 
high and cinched in again .

exploded with excess fabric ,

a multitude of pleats , poofy
petticoats , and fabulous collars , 
all made of the best taffeta , 
nylon , rayon , wool and leather in 
the brightest and boldest 
patterns and colors . 
Consumerism of the 1950s- housewives and the 
baby boom . Spending money on things because 
they can . 
Teenage culture and clothing also became a 
larger part of television , movies and music . 
Men ’ s Fashion 1950 ’ s
For men , fashions changed very little throughout the decade . Choices were 
suits , sport coats , slacks , sweaters , or casual wear all in similar fabrics and 
styles . Occasionally bolder patterns might emerge for casual wear , but 
business clothing remained largely unchanged during the fifties . Work 
clothing for laborers was usually in the style of the military , because a 
majority of the men at the time had served in the armed forces or were still a 
part of the military .

1960 ’ s
The 60 ’ s opened with the simple Aline dress . Most dresses were very 
simple and so accessories were 
both expressive and bold . 
Some fashion history writers have 
called this era the “ Great 
masquerade .  ” 
Clean lines and very bold . 
Eyes were lined with black , 
shadowed with frosty white , 
and topped off with a full set of 
false eyelashes . Lips were 
nude . 
Twiggy was the top model . 
She was long and lean , which 
was a break from the fleshed 
Edwardian beauty seen in 
some form up through the 
1950 ’ s
1960 ’ s
1960
The length might be mini , micromini , midi , or maxi . Maxi coats and 
sweater coats were really practical 
in cold climates for the mini skirt 
wearer . 
The “ warbabies ” or Baby 
Boomers , infants born 
immediately after the war ended in 
1945 , were maturing . 
By 1960 teenagers were a 
powerful group . In the United 
States , fully one-half of the 
population was under 25 . This 
enormous group of energetic 
young also had their own minds 
for fashion and were not dictated 
to by Paris or by anyone else . 
1960 ’ s
The 1960 ’ s was a time of action , 
violence , protest , rebellion , 
experimentation , and counterculture . 
Dramatic events took place during 
this decade and dramatic changes in 
fashion occurred . 
The 60-70 ’ s catered to the youth both 
in advertising and production in the 
clothing industry . Teenagers had 
money to spend ( 3 . 5 billion on 
apparel in 1965 ,  ) and enjoyed 
keeping up with the latest trends . 
During these years two sets of 
fashion developed side by side : 
fashion for the young and fashion for 
the rest of society . 
1960
No other landmark of the 60 ’ s was the 
pants suit .  “ Women had attempted 
pants since the days of Mrs . Bloomer . 
Chanel , in the 1930 ’ s made them 
acceptable as sportswear and during 
the war years overall and jeans were a 
practical necessity . But trousers for 
women always had decided overtones 
of the resort or the assembly line . They 
had never been totally respectable . 
A major fashion breakthrough of the 
late 60 ’ s was the tailored pants suit . It 
was seen everywhere and was chic , 
elegant , comfortable , and convenient , 
not to mention practical . 
Movements of the 
60 ’ s Civil Rights
There were three major movements during the 60 ’ s 
that helped to shape fashion : 
First – The Civil Rights Movement sparked an 
impressive move to ethnic fashion . Blacks and whites 
alike found interest in the African colors and prints . Afro 
hairstyles were worn by most blacks and some whites 
used perms to get the Afro hairstyle . Some Afros could 
be measured at 3 inches above the scalp going straight 
up and straight out . Most were shorter and more 
natural looking . The expression of the day was “ Black 
is Beautiful .  ” 
Women ’ s Liberation
Second – The Women ’ s Liberation Movement caused 
women to burn their bras and wear men ’ s clothing . The 
 “ unisex ” clothing , clothing worn by both sexes , is a 
result of this movement coupled with the sexual 
revolution that was taking place at the same time . Girls 
turned to pants because they preferred the long , clean ,  
 “ liberating ” line . Boys wore embroidered shirts and 
beads because peasant embroidery and bright colors 
offered a liberation from the notion of what had been 
masculine taste for 150 years . 
Women ’ s underwear went from wired bras to no bras at 
all or stretchy elastic bras with little or no support . The 
tight 1950 ’ s girdles with garters and nylon stockings that 
ended mid-thigh , were knocked into history by the 
comfortable one-piece nylon pantyhose . 
The Peace Movement
Third – The Peace Movement ( or anti-Vietnam War 
Movement .  ) The Vietnam War was not anywhere as 
popular or supported as the two world wars had been . 
This war had the opposite effect on the country ; instead of 
pulling the country together to save resources , the 
country was pulled apart . Everyone took sides . The 
teenagers who revolted against the war and the 
 “ established ” way of living , and working were called 
 “ hippies .  ” 
The hippie dress was a throw back to the beatniks of the 
1950 ’ s . It was a casual , sometimes sloppy dress . The 
main focus was self-expression . Whatever you wanted to 
wear , you wore . The hippies were not a majority of the 
teenagers , it should be noted , although some of the 
fashions spilled into the mainstream teen fashion . 
60 ’ s British Invasion
The most memorable fashion 
details of this era would be bell 
bottoms , mini-skirts , and platform 
shoes . Others include the A-line 
skirt and dress , boots , and the 
 “ Mod Look ” brought to the United 
States by the Beatles and other 
musical groups . 
It was called the “ British invasion ” 
but it wasn ’ t a reference to the 
military , but rather an invasion of 
American culture . The music , 
fashion , hairstyles , and make-up , to 
name a few were transferred 
across the Atlantic and took the 
60 ’ s by storm . 
The Invention of the MINI skirt
The mini was one fashion that hit early in 
the 60 ’ s . It was the design of Mary Quant 
from Wales . She is regarded as the 
mother of the mini and high boots ; 
shoulder bags and the “ poor boy ” sweater .  
 “ Pop ” and “ Mod ” were terms also borrowed 
from the British to describe fashion of this 
time . 
Another word used to describe the 60 ’ s is 
psychedelic . It was at least true for the 
colors and fabrics of that time . Floral 
patterns reflected the “ flower power ” theme 
of the hippie movement . Daisies , mums , 
and other flowers adorned everything from 
fabrics to wallpaper , from busses to vans . 
The colors were bright and bold . Mary Quant
The Calm of the Sixties
Jacqueline O . Kennedy 
also stood out at this 
time to represent a more 
conservative fitted dress 
favored by many women .

1970 ’ s –
Fashions in the 70 ’ s were extremely 
flexible . 
Man-made fibers had progressed due to the 
high tech of the day . Polyester , that had 
been developed as early as 1939 and 
shelved until after the war , was a very 
popular fiber . It was blended with natural 
fibers giving the fabric the advantages of 
both fiber groups . 
Some men ’ s suits were fashioned in 100% 
polyester and marketed as the wash and 
wear suit . 
It was called the “ leisure suit ” and had a 
brief moment in time . It was very casual 
with buttons down the front , patch pockets , 
and bell bottoms . It was comfortable and 
easy to care for , as well as being wrinkleresistant . 
1970 ’ s
The hippie influence was still seen in bright beads , 
embroidery on shirts , Levi pants and jackets , and tiedyed fabrics . Long hair was a hot topic ; first seen as a 
sign of rebellion , and later accepted as fashionable ,  “ in 
moderation .  ” Sideburns were worn long ; beards and 
moustaches were popular for both teenagers and their 
parents . 
Bee Gees
Disco Fever and the Bell Bottom
Pants were worn skin tight ; hip hugger pants and skirts were worn with 
hip belts ; a wide bell bottom style was popular n pant legs and sleeves . 
In the early 70 ’ s cuffs on trouser style pants for both men and women 
were reintroduced . 
Pant legs got wider and wider and were worn long enough to cover the 
shoe and scrape the floor . Platform shoes got higher and higher with 
very chunky heels . 
1970 ’ s Hair
Hair for teenage girls… the longer and straighter the 
better . Iron their hair . 
Orange juice and soup cans were recycled into curlers 
to straighten out hopelessly wavy or curly hair . 
Full bangs were worn long enough to cover the 
eyebrows , but not long enough to merge with the false 
eyelashes .

women hit the gyms , spas , and athletic centers in droves creating a 
big market for athletic clothes that were not only functional but 
attractive and flattering . 
Spandex and Lycra in bright colors worn with “ leggings ” and thick 
socks pushed down to the ankles in puddles , was the preferred fabric 
for aerobic exercises . 
The old “ gym shoe ” was replaced with 100 or more different kinds of 
specialized sports shoes . Whatever you planned to do , there was a 
special shoe to do it in . 
1980 ’ s Working Girl
During the 1980 ’ s many women 
continued in or joined the work 
force . 
The “ power suit ” was designed . It 
was a broad-shouldered lapel 
jacket worn with a skirt . Pants 
were seen as too casual . 
The power color for the power suit 
could be navy , black , gray , 
burgundy , but not brown . 
Pump shoes were appropriate ; 
not too high for the heels but not 
completely flat either .

very rich ; fabrics were fluid and 
flowing .

worn long and belted .

would explain the hair 
of this period .

the time . Bangs were 
very popular and often 
lifted many inches 
above the scalp . 
Crimping hair was very 
popular as well .

2000 ’ s
A “ retro ” look has begun 
mixing hits of the past and 
regurgitating them in styles 
for today . Trends show that

Proof of this prediction is 
seen in large hoop earrings , 
the return of the more fitted 
leg , pleats , gathers and 
ruffles in shirts .
