three things you must combine to be a
filmmaker you gotta combine art parking
and lunch those three things you could
make a hit movie no movie is easy to
make it takes a long time and a lot of
stuff your job is to compromise every
day of your life this is always a
powerful position it ' s the least
powerful of all excess you have to
concentrate for the longest each time I
start a film all I ' m doing it while I ' m
editing it by the time it ' s finished I
think this is the greatest thing since
hash I mean there ' s everybody ' s going to
love this film this is gonna be a
smashing success this is gonna win every
Academy Award everything and you know
they don ' t but I ' ve never gone into
making a film made a film finished a
film that I didn ' t think was gonna just
be knockout successful
I love directing films I love the
challenge of it I find that every day
that I ' m directing I ' m trying to
synthesize all of the arts you know
writing composition photography
performance music painting I mean
everything editing is all contained in
the art of filmmaking you develop a
screenplay and you prepare a movie the
pre-production and then one day you
start to shoot the film and then one day
it ' s all over and your baby ' s born it
comes out you look at it
and now it ' s no longer yours and that
year of your life hopefully has been
well spent and it ' s been productive and
fulfilling in its simplest form that ' s
what picture making is it ' s it ' s such an
organic process that requires so many
people to do all the right things at all
the right times with passion and
consistency and it ' s just it ' s a very
difficult and quantifiable thing
filmmaking my brother says directing
plays is what he should do because
that ' s the only time when the director
gets to go home
and the actress
I was in Texas promoting winch house and
I was on a radio talk show and some guy
called in and he said he saw Baron
Munchausen and he giggled in awe and
that ' s when I went on my tombstone terry
gilliam r . i . p
he giggled in awe I hope the films
actually continue no matter how old they
become to surprise people and make them
look at the world through different eyes
I think as all I care about
that I wasn ' t predictable and that I had
a sense of humor and I wasn ' t afraid to
to look in the dark places and showed in
some ways some some ways in and out of
them rather than going around them and
and pretending they weren ' t there you
know the best gratification you get is
when somebody on the street comes up to
you and says something and you know it
coming from their heart you know it ' s
not coming from gee I want to be in show
business it ' s coming from their heart
and I you know when those feelings are
and it is it ' s beautiful and it makes it
all worthwhile you know and it makes you
realize you ' re connecting even if you
connect with a few people it ' s wonderful
I mean ultimately filmmakers are
remembered for their films most
correctly you know the the private stuff
is ultimately irrelevant
it ' s what what made it up on the screen
you know so I never want to put anything
in a film that I ' m going to have to feel
a little cringe about later and so far I
have it so far I feel pretty good about
about the stuff that ' s that ' s made it up
on the screen maybe not some of the
stuff that ' s on the editing room floor
but the stuff that made it into the into
the final the final cut if there ' s a
couple of those films that are around
that people are still you know by the
time I ' m long gone you ' ll be able to
just probably dial up those films on
your phone your telephone that ' s great
but it ' s way way too early to to talk
about how I ' d like to be remembered you
know I ' ve never been asked that question
for face your mortality and ads I want
to be remembered for writing about
people and there was an ounce of
humanity and the stories that I was able
to tell I ' m the happiest
in the world my fondest wish I think I ' d
like to be remembered as a guy who
really cared about the craft I really
cared about telling a good story and
really cared about what he did that ' s a
good legacy in that that would be a
worthy thing to to leave behind I sort
of like to see a working filmmaker who
took assignments more often than not who
you know was smart enough to gather
together a gifted cast every time out
and make movies that in some way or
another addressed kind of the the up
side of human nature people who who you
know enjoy movies will will simply think
that a film of mine is worth giving a
chance to is stands an above-average
chance of being good involving worthy of
their you know 90 to 120 minutes people
or you ' ve evaluated and put in context
only having done one album one novel one
movie one play and that ' s crazy how you
gonna really intelligently evaluate
someone who ' s only done one thing smart
people know you only do that when you
win an artist develops a body of work so
that ' s all that ' s always been the goal
that to try to build a body of work the
fact that I like to make films about
stories that I ' m fascinated by and
characters and behavior and personal
kinds of moments and humor and humanity
that ' s what ultimately excites me and if
I can continue to do that and have a
good time and have people be fascinated
by it that ' s all I can do I mean I hope
my work it ' s going to be remembered in a
better light than it is today
and I think in time a lot of the
contemporary feelings about the films
will have drifted away and people will
be able to see the films in their true
light they ' re you know very simple and
very complex at the same time I hope
that people will remember
me and my films as a personal JV
affiliate movies are cause I said out of
style right now but I don ' t care
I ' ll make feel-good movies and make you
feel good even if you don ' t want to feel
good I ' ll make you feel good and I
remembered I just as a girl who survived
in a business of men I guess I set some
groundwork which I didn ' t mean to do
I wasn ' t knocking on peoples door just
happen like my life actually happened by
accident I tried to depict people in
places certain certain types of places
at certain types of people as honestly
as possible as realistically even it was
even if it was you know how should I say
not necessarily the physical aspect of
it but the nature of the people and the
nature of the society they ' re in in the
case of mean streets our Alice Ora taxi
driver and Raging Bull and Goodfellas in
an age of innocence trying to be true to
those human emotions that make up what
we are as people
quality does start to kick in so you do
start to get aware of the fact that I ' ve
known X number of films so I start to
think about them as a kind of yes what
you leave behind really you know I think
all you do is think hope it was worth it
it ' s very flattering and good for the
you have to feel it other people enjoy
what you bring to the screen is a piece
of entertainment you know I can feel the
applause inside me or am i hearing them
I I have absolutely no perspective on
how anyone should interpret or think
about my work after I ' m gone when I ' m
gone I ' m gone the work will do what it
does I mean I guess I would hope that
people are entertained by it that it it
entertains them one pleasure that I ' ve
had is that you know we get letters from
families that say that you know they had
a dying relative in a hospital or
something and they and they all sat in
the hospital room and watched police
squad or you know watched one of the
Naked Gun movies or airplane and they
all laughed I mean some people think it
it actually does cure cancer so that ' s
kind of that ' s a nice feeling is it just
to think that maybe we
something positive I don ' t have a plan
for this but I hope that I just hope
that my body of work is always one of
stretching and not ever becoming one
that I don ' t ever want to go back over
any familiar familiar territory yeah I
think we staying active in life is what
keeps a person vital maybe it ' s maybe
it ' s time to hang it up but maybe
there ' s a couple more things to do out
there
the only parting words I have is that
when I die I want on my tombstone it
should read now I ' m in this place I mean
it really is like going down to the
beach and let me say hey let ' s let ' s
make a sandcastle we go down there and
we all work and I say you do the windows
and you do the moat and and we work and
work and then the tide starts coming in
and we finish this castle and we go sit
up and have a beer and watch the tide
come in and then in an hour
nothing ' s there and everybody starts
walking home and we hear this and I said
well what about next Saturday you want
to swim build another one somebody say
well okay but I ' m not doing Windows this
time I want to do them the towers and
that ' s really all what it is but
eventually it ' s all gonna be you know an
even beach
a script is not meant to be literature
it ' s it ' s not going to be published
probably it ' s only read by the people
who are involved with it once the script
leaves the the writers typewriter it
becomes the province of the actor to
make it live to give it flesh and blood
if you take 50 directors and 50 actors
and give them the same script you will
get that many that multiplicity of
interpretations it ' s always good to
write a script in six weeks or something
that ' s the right amount of time for the
first pass you know you can work on it
more later but the hole has to come
together quickly otherwise it ' s gonna be
a problem I do write the scripts
longhand I started out that way and it ' s
just a habit we ' ll all have different
ways of being inspired and and do our
thinking best under certain conditions I
just like to do cursive and it makes me
feel better I wouldn ' t know a good
script if it bit me in the face you know
I I really don ' t think I would you know
I ' ve often dealt with bad scripts or
scripts there aren ' t even there but you
kind of get involved because you ' re
something about the property or the
energy of it that ' s like yeah this is
cool okay I think for me the real
criterion is that a script is a
page-turner is that you can ' t put the
thing down as if you read it in one go
and you jump up and say I ' ve got to do
this if you ' re on the screen why do you
want to be on the screen and if you want
to be a writer you know it ' s not like I
want to be it ' s just that you have no
it ' s not like a choice you just are you
just are because there ' s stories that
you want to tell the things you want to
write about in my case it ' s either
something I develop from scratch and I
fall in love with and I have to make it
or it ' s something I read somebody
submits it to me and I want to see that
picture so badly and since I ' ve read it
I see it I ' ve seen it already because I
want to see that movie
the way I saw it not the way somebody
else does I don ' t choose types of films
I just stumble across stories I stumble
across characters and and when I do you
know I just sort of accept or apply
whatever genre or style or tone seems
appropriate
I ' ve got to say wow what a good story I
want to share that that ' s what people
should see this movie
but if it really pulls me in and you
know III know that difference it ' s a
bigger tickle that gets me to say I ' m
not giving this away I ' m keeping this
for myself that ' s a much bigger tickle
in between films it ' s time to catch
ideas for the next film or ideas that
you ' ve had in the past that are
fragments that you never knew what they
were good for will marry to it suddenly
you ' re just getting it piecemeal and so
your job is to kind of pay attention and
try to see how they marry and feel it
and one day a script evolves yeah I hate
when they put in stage direction or
crying or yeah we stop it get that out
of the way yeah you want someone to come
in who ' s gonna give you something
different so you want someone to be able
to say it but also add something from
them it takes a long time till I feel
like I ' ve gotten into the character in a
way that is not forced and that ' s the
point I look for I look for a moment I
don ' t mean it ' s easy but it feels
natural or it feels right the subplots
of a film those are very important to me
particularly when you have material as
rich as Steve King ' s I want to speak in
the tone of the author I want to speak
in his voice
otherwise why am i telling the story the
books that struck me were were sometimes
a combination of very detailed character
work and great adventure and that would
be like Joseph Conrad who had enormous
impact on me when I was studying English
Literature at the University of Michigan
that all the writers that I liked
Fitzgerald and Dostoyevsky and Hemingway
were about character and I found that
the movies that I responded to were
about character in looking back at the
films I ' ve made I the one thing I
noticed that ' s consistent is that they
seem to always focus around characters
who are somehow multi-layered
that their actual identities are or who
they really are is sort of hidden behind
a mask of some kind and I think that
subject matter for some reason interests
me something realistic but then yet
larger than life I think it ' s why I ' m
drawn to science fiction
both say anything in Jerry Maguire were
the result of long periods of research
and writing they cooked a long time on
the stove those two scripts I advise
that for for anybody to research and
really live with your script before you
go out and make the movie I actually met
with Nora Ephron about another project
which she wasn ' t so interested in and at
lunch we were having I said I don ' t know
what the plot is I don ' t know it ' s just
men and women talking to each other
about men and women that ' s all it ' s
gonna be that ' s what we started with and
I would sit with Nora and I tell her my
experiences I tell her this happened
this happened and we used them put them
in the film it was really a
collaboration a big collaboration and
just of a big soup the sketches were
written just as funny sketches now they
could have been done in a very obvious
cheap comic way but I think it was
because Terry and I were so determined
to try to make serious epic films so
everything ' s done very very
realistically and then we have this very
silly scene where a man is claiming not
to be dead I think I ' ve always felt
about comedy if you could place it in as
believable a situation it ' s gonna be
funnier then putting in an obviously
artificial and obviously phony
situations it said it ' s that the tension
between the two things it gets that
makes it more interesting the real
approach to the picture was almost like
oral history where before there was
writing a man would tell a story a
village storyteller well Henry Hill and
his dialogue that ' s quoted throughout
the book is literally telling you a
story on a street corner there was Jimmy
and Tommy and me
and there was Anthony stabile are you
doing and I would listen to a lot of
corner street street corner stories when
I was growing up some wonderful actors
cool really just kids in the street so
this is how I heard it just the way I
heard people telling stories in the
street and that ' s what you have from the
book and we let that guide us we let
that voice guide us in fact that ' s why
we use so much voiceover the first Naked
Gun we all sat down and everybody wrote
30 pages we all wrote the first draft
separately I mean not even in the same
room together and I think I wrote one
more draft with Jerry and then the next
six drafts I wrote myself probably in in
pre-production Bladerunner it sent me
but Hampton and Michael did he sent me
what essentially was an internal play
taking place in an apartment that ' s how
it started so what followed was eight
the Hoffman process with Hampton every
day where we just expanded the whole
story into it this large science fiction
I did learn from exit to Eden that
people like to see certain signs of
sexuality the biggest thing in the
country now is phone sex so they like to
imagine it maybe they don ' t like to see
it imagine it second biggest thing is
porno movies so I discovered I was the
one that people do not like group
voyeurism
they just like voyeurism not groups
because they got to uncomfortable in the
theater
you know be great if there ' s this one
book you know what do you do to talk to
actors to get them to do what you want
to do look and I heard Colin Hanks on
some of his father ' s advice times advice
one was beyond time know your lines
would be nice to the crew yes yes yes
I can ' t imagine making a film and
throwing the visual side out the window
that ' d be the disaster be awful but
what ' s important is the actors you can
have an awful looking movie that ' s well
active that will go through the roof and
you can have a beautifully lit nothing
that will go down the toilet always
there your whole movie the faces their
faces what how they how they just you
know literally ignite the frame with
emotion you can ' t buy that you can ' t
create it you can ' t paint it on the
screen you have to deal with the
humanity of it and the humanity of the
actor actors are people whose gift is
saying goodbye to themselves and taking
on a new persona and the more they feel
at ease and free to let their talent go
the better it is for them and the film
it ' s like trying to catch lightning in a
bottle you ' re trying to you ' re trying to
catch something that is effervescent
that is unknown and it ' s only the
directors feeling about the actor and
knowledge of the actor that allows the
director to push the actor further and
further if a scene is played by five
people and it ' s exactly the way I
envisioned it and it ' s exactly the way
it was written and it ' s exactly the way
everything is supposed to be I said okay
that ' s alright but I ' m not very excited
about it
because if I say play it this way I ' ve
narrowed it in to where they ' re gonna
stay within that boundary and they ' re
not gonna have all this room to work I
want them to have all the room there is
I really believe the best way to direct
is to really get the best cast you can
and to make a world in which they ' re
safe to try whatever they want to try
and then get out of their way because
they ' re gonna do something
that I could never never have dreamed of
doing you have to be in an eye-level
partnership with your actors and that ' s
with every actor that ' s not just with
the stars that ' s with every actor I mean
anybody that ' s got a moment in your film
no matter how fleeting is just as
important as anybody else in the film
these supporting casts really are the
unsung heroes of many films and
certainly I think of my not just the
obvious big names like Tom Hanks or
torch and Carrie but but everybody there
is vital to the process of telling the
story as the story itself
they are the conduit through which the
story flows I ' ve always loved the
commitment that actors have to the
material and I always appreciated seeing
them with their scripts where they ' ve
you know they ' ve got all these notes and
the margins and they ' ve they ' ve got all
these kind of impressions and things
that came to mind and beats they want to
hit it ' s just like that ' s great I do
believe in showing actors what they what
what skin the scenes gonna appear like
again if I have something I don ' t try to
keep it hidden from them because then
you can get even more elaboration out of
their suggestion good performers have
ideas and visualizations that will
enhance the project once you ' ve worked
with an actor things get much simpler
there ' s a kind of shorthand to it so you
don ' t you don ' t really have to say very
much to them and they sort of trust you
and you know what they really in a
serious way how much they can bring to
it if you let them do it
I don ' t really direct actors I cast well
and get the right people for the part
and then I hopefully provide a good
audience for them I listen to them I
when they ' re funny I laugh when they ' re
sad I cry I remember growing up thinking
oh the way you direct actors must be you
know John Ford would say you know
they ' re like cattle you will have any
real amount and then in Bergman would be
very sensitive I don ' t I couldn ' t work
out how you ' re supposed to work with
actors and then I realized it was
couldn ' t be easy you get the right actor
and you talk intelligently to them
and you ' re sensitive to their needs and
it kind of happens and I always try to
create an environment not unlike the one
that we had on The Andy Griffith Show
when I was eight years old that I
observed it was an environment where
actors were encouraged to participate
I ' m never asking an actor to do
something that I can do I ' m never asking
to make a transition that I can ' t make
in a scene but if they ' re struggling
with the transition or with a moment I
can act it out for them I can show them
what I what what needs to happen there
because I have a pretty good ear and I
have a certain feeling about how I want
a scene to sound musically there ' s a
music to every scene and the notes that
you hit in a scene especially with
comedy which is all very rhythmic and
you have to have the right emphasis and
you have to have the right rhythms I
wanna make the jokes work I have a sense
of that so I can give them that I can
show them that I don ' t know if any kind
of a secret working with kids you know I
feel like I am a kid so I think I relate
to kids really well and also allowing
them to have a say in the characters
they ' re playing allowing them to mix
their own language in with the language
of the writer so so many of the
wonderful lines from et albeit written
by Millicent Matheson and wonderfully
written by her other lines came from
Drew Barrymore and and Henry Thomas and
Robert McNaughton just just from that
zeitgeist the kids bring to it you know
to a film I think in my earlier films
ice I felt compelled to tell the actors
more than they needed to know I would do
things that were very could have been
very nerve-wracking just before I would
roll a camera I say now remember to hit
that mark and lean into the light you
know and I drive him crazy over it
because I didn ' t want the take messed up
because of some mechanical thing that I
wanted them to remember to do and I
think that was kind of so I stopped
doing that I remember one scene that
Robert Stack was in an airplane we were
more or less asking him to play Eliot
Ness we had written this one line where
he had to kind of repeat some things
over and over again and he was saying
it ' s it ' s his ship now his command he ' s
the top dog the big cheese that it was
which we actually had gotten out of an
old by John Byner routine who was
imitating Robert Stack in the rehearsal
he said he ' s the top dog
he ' s the head man
he ' s the chief and we had to explain no
no we want you to do it more like John
Boehner and so any Ruggeri kind of
following him around on the set trying
to do Gerry ' s impersonation of John
Boehner doing an impersonation of Robert
Stack and and that ' s and he did get it
he finally I think he got the picture I
don ' t know if Bob stack had ever seen
John Boehner ' s impersonation but he he
actually did a pretty good impersonation
of himself at the end beside me noticed
kind of a filmmaker that did a good job
and was amusing him to do a film I was
also known as a handler where I could
handle anybody which I do handle any
kind of story I have no fear of anybody
I think one of the biggest things in
handling big stars you can ' t be
frightened Bette Midler told me after
the movie beaches she says you know
you ' re the first director who really
wasn ' t afraid of me and I come from the
streets of the Bronx I ' m a friend of
nobody what are they going to do yell
I ' ve heard yelling you wouldn ' t believe
you should meet my father I once said
that I like to get people even just as
they ' re beginning and before rehab
that ' s when you get the stars and I ' ve
gotten a lot of him in that slot
the cinematographer doesn ' t just light
you know he is involved with the
emotions with movement with an overall
look a sense of visual and they can make
or break you
it ' s it ' s just another faction that you
add together and your thought process is
an amalgamation of lots and one of them
is your cinematographer I worked with
James Wong Howe who was a great great
cameraman to try to take the color out
of the color if you will they sprayed
the trees semi-transparent brownish
liquid to take some of the color out we
burnt tires the black smoke kind of
drifted in and out of the scenes and
filtered everything down these are not
necessary today you can do it
technically digitally computer wise
whatever but in the in 1965 this was a
kind of a bold technique I was very
interested for example in Francis
Bacon ' s pictures which are horrifying
when you look at them this smeared and
blood and you think my god what ' s
happening underneath that so I tried to
do the visual equivalent of that and we
did a lot of shaking images we rolled it
at four frames rather than 24 frames and
I would have the the ought the mere act
of like moving around like this to
create a kind of frenetic sort of blur
if you looked at it for a second it was
silly but if you looked at it for a
quarter of a second or even less it was
frightening when you put the right noise
with it when you put the right sound
effect with it so it was a question of
the amount you got to see these things
it ' s fascinating really
in Buffalo Bill I would go back for
quarter of a mile and shoots a two shot
through a long lens which gave it that
it flattened it out and gave it just a
kind of bizarre look and we shot the
whole film that way I remember we had so
many times the camera was so far away
you we had to communicate over a
telephone line my cinematographer David
Tattersall and I really had a lot
discussions about how to keep that set
interesting in the Green Mile because
you were you really are on a cell block
for this small cell block set for really
the lion ' s share of the movie we wanted
very much to approach every scene on
that cell block in some kind of visually
different manner so that we wouldn ' t get
the audience we the audience wouldn ' t
get a visually oppressed by it I think a
lot of people aren ' t trained to watch
dense visual films because most films
put the object the the key thing right
there in front of you so and it lingers
on it so yeah that ' s what we ' re supposed
to be looking at at any moment then we
were using wide-angle lenses in ways
that people hadn ' t used them and
wide-angle lens can become both strange
thing you ' ve seen me into the film and
the film is surrounding you it ' s it ' s I
think it ' s one hand you ' re feeling
claustrophobic on the other hand you ' re
feeling agoraphobic because there ' s so
much of it and and there ' s so many
things to occupy your eyes what was very
challenging as a director try to come up
with something you know photograph this
this bus just confined space it would
not be monotonous and not Lola
audience to sleep because it ' s a small
space I really decide that we shoot it
on super 16 I like to shoot with two
cameras and to 35 cameras were not been
able to fit in that bus the final battle
and the opening battle were the two
hardest parts of that picture obviously
to you know to to put on film honestly
and I think if it weren ' t for
Schindler ' s List
I would not had a way into the telling
of that story because she knows list
gave me courage about the documentary
approach to filmmaking I said you know
I ' m gonna take a lesson from Schindler ' s
List I ' m gonna shoot Private Ryan the
same way of combat cameraman shot World
War two as low to the ground and and
it ' s safely out of harm ' s way as
possible getting shots when he could and
with a very shaky camera it ' s never
slick and CB DeMille it ' s extremely you
know you know rough and almost dirty
there are two reasons black and white
number one the color fading problem I
said why design the picture in color
when it ' s gonna fade we have no
guarantee of the color remaining more
than
years maybe less at this rate and I
think a lot of it had to do with the
aspect of how I grew up looking at
television black-and-white movies and
how that set you in a certain timeframe
a period piece in a way and also made it
more expressive so that you don ' t know
that the fluids that are coming off the
fighters or the blood or sweat or water
you don ' t know what it is it ' s part of
the the whole experience of being inside
the ring and so between the idea of
something looking period linking us to
the daily news for example the
photograph photography of the Daily News
photography or Ouija linking us there
and also with the idea of not fading
color there was some color in the film
but they already I ' ve already faded it
because it was faded home movies the
first day I was ever on a soundstage was
on this Universal with the Hitchcock
hour and I was working with a great
cinematographer named Jack Warren John L
Warren who had won an Academy Award for
the country girl that he lit with Grace
Kelly and so I set up a shot that was
like a four or five page master that
involved people walking all over one set
and going into another set and the
camera following them and and it took me
about four or five hours to get it
Norman Lloyd came up behind me and Jack
Warren was standing behind me and I
heard Norman whisper to Jack Warner said
Jack he said that shot was incredible
he said that you know it took forever he
said but it was really wonderful I heard
Jack whispered to him he said that was
my idea so that shot was my idea meaning
his and I learned my first lesson in
Hollywood you know which is that success
has many fathers but failure is an
orphan
whenever we ' re startled or delighted to
the movies it ' s always about something
touching our hearts and our minds a new
way or in a very familiar way that seems
fresh it has nothing to do with budget
or stardom or commercial success or
critical success it has to do with the
startling insight it has to do with the
moment of blinding truth and when you ' re
sitting in a movie theater and you
expect nothing and suddenly you ' re
giving it everything it ' s what we hope
for most from art whether it ' s a
painting or a poem or song but it just
stirs us up in some new way and we say
yes that makes my life more vivid and
real and rich as a director you are
constantly challenged by how long are
you willing to stay there to try and get
something a little bit better how much
are you willing to gamble of a Studios
time and money of the actors emotional
output of your own sense of what is the
right way to approach this project to
either settle for something that you
don ' t think is quite right or to try and
go one step beyond go one step beyond to
try and achieve something a little
better
it ' s about satisfaction it ' s about maybe
learning a little something enjoying
yourself having a terrific time and
maybe feeling a little something if you
can get that and you can get an audience
excited about something that ' s important
that ' s more important to me than what
the head of some studio thinks about me
I grew up watching John Ford movies and
David Lee movies and Frank Capra movies
and Billy Wilder movies and this to me
these these always focused so much on on
the story and on the characters you
never really saw the directors hand in
it necessarily you never saw the
director I ' m doing what a lot of
directors seem to do nowadays we should
jump in front of the lens and say hey
I ' m the star here not the story not the
actors it seems like a lot of people
want to prove something about their
directorial style my directorial style
is I want to as I want to have as
invisible a style as possible I want to
be the man behind the curtain and let
the story lead the way I subscribe to
the
the theory of bill goldman well-known
screenwriter who says nobody knows
nothing and and and he ' s kind of right
when it comes to movies in Hollywood
making movies or whether whether they ' re
made in Hollywood New York or Europe or
wherever is nobody really knows anything
about whether films gonna make money or
not and all you can do is just think in
terms of making the film the very best
you can and that and don ' t think about
all that other stuff in fact it isn ' t
your job to think about all you have is
to present the story as the best you can
it was regarded as far more than a movie
it ' s got to be entertaining but I want
it to be more I want it to be raising
consciousness you know I want people to
be feeling exhilarated to be as if they
experienced another world they maybe
never thought of or partly or just
something has changed for them maybe
forever
whenever people would meet me even as I
went onto films that were a little more
bit more socially acceptable or when
people became more used to the idea of a
horror film as part of a social
commentary or whatever people would
always say I can ' t believe you make
those I can ' t believe you have those
thoughts in your head and where do you
get those thoughts I I ' ve always been
struck by that disconnect between people
and the world they live in they almost
always when they see a piece of art that
depicts violence will look at the
filmmaker as the source and it still
strikes me to this day you know that art
becomes kind of the target for what
people are upset about in real life I ' m
trying to as a storyteller broaden my
own understanding of what is
entertaining and what kinds of stories
can be entertaining that aren ' t
necessarily genre films that you that
you immediately associate with high
entertainment and so I am interested in
pushing myself to find that which is
entertaining compelling involving in in
stories presenting it to an audience and
having them feel that yes they ' ve been
transported as Billy Wilder says you
must sugarcoat that pill they swallow it
before they even know what they have
swallowed and I don ' t really think of it
in that
a mechanical way but what I do know is
that when when the lights come up after
you ' ve seen a movie you sometimes go out
into the world and look at the world
differently and that ' s you know that ' s a
lot of lofty talk that I never really
say out loud but I don ' t want to
squander the opportunity of taking a
couple hours of people ' s time I want I
want them to feel enhanced from the
experience same way I would as a fan I
love doing this job it ' s a great job to
have you know when I can you know be a
part of somebody else ' s dream and
putting that dream on the screen or if I
can get an idea from my you know naked
brain in the middle of the night and
write it down on the back of a you know
piece of paper and 18 months later
whatever ' s on the back of that piece of
paper is a is a big movie or a small
movie I mean that is the stuff that
makes all of us want them you know work
in this business and create and have fun
the whole thing is translating that idea
to a medium and in the case of film it
takes a long time and you always need to
go back and and stay true to that idea
keep checking that idea so they ' re very
special and they ' re very it ' s very
special that you be true to the ideas
just when you think you have it you
don ' t you never do you know have it you
know you ' ve always got to keep adjusting
it you know if you ' re not your own
biggest critic you ' re in trouble
basically I think the media ' s really
done something to our culture to where
people are thinking about that more than
they are the root of what it is they ' re
doing
as things get more at our disposal
technology and we get more information
rapidly it ' s always important to go back
into yourself and remember that it ' s all
based on an idea a project and a passion
that you have to do something it ' s very
hard to to ward off those influences and
those things out there and to just keep
that focus and again that ' s where that ' s
the seed where everything else comes
from and if you don ' t have that just
don ' t have that foundation and I think
even for myself I find it ' s hard to kind
of keep that and remember that with all
this abstraction going on when you ' re
doing a movie you take it seriously
because you ' re I ' m compulsive obsessive
but it is just a movie
there are more important things in life
life is more important in show business
every single studio is now owned by a
large conglomerate and that in all of
their other product lines manufacture a
disposable repeatable product whether
it ' s a car or a soft drink or an
electronic device and everybody knows
that what it ' s designed for is two hours
of entertainment and then it can be
disposed of never thought of again it ' s
it doesn ' t feel as good as it used to
feel where you felt that everybody had a
shot and each film finding its own
audience in a certain way it ' s become in
a sense to pay attention to too precious
to talked about it ' s become too
discovered of the thing and everybody
talks about grosses and it lost its
magic you know there is no such thing as
the star anymore or the mystique you
know that ' s gone there ' s no mistake it ' s
it ' s a business there ' s a new generation
of people making decisions in Hollywood
who are the worst kind of progeny of
television they don ' t even remember
Midnight Cowboy and mash and shampoo and
last detail and Last Tango in Chinatown
and Godfather and American Graffiti
their references are two hits of the
last five years and they ' re trying to
duplicate those the industry changed in
the early 80s the 70s were over the
personal film in a sense to a certain
extent because there are still personal
films being made in Hollywood but this
is something else something else
happened there you had Star Wars you had
et even which was made for his personal
film by Spielberg but it was made for
very little money ten million made
billions so you know everything changed
and the dark of pictures had a hard time
getting financed the films that are more
complex or more personal at times are
harder to sell the upside is much less
and ultimately they ' re open for more
criticism because they ultimately
present a bunch of ideas whereas if you
make something that is much more
mechanical in a sense it ' s more
protected at the same time because what
can you say you can say well I don ' t
leave the thing we ' re not supposed to
what ' s the difference it ' s not important
you know and it and and it isn ' t in a
way it ' s not it ' s just the energy and
the noise and the confusion and whatever
and it kind of like pumps you up and you
kind of watch and you leave and go home
and that ' s the end of that so there ' s a
very little upside to to any kind of you
know personal film than a sense
sometimes may even get under your skin
in a way people are scared to make
interesting films so everybody ' s looking
for this big blockbuster and allows
movies suck they ' re terrible
you ' re finding that the middle films are
the ones that are being cut out now
because you concentrate everything on
the big blockbusters and you make films
for five or seven or eight million
dollars those are safe to me and some of
them might work it ' s what ' s interesting
is the films in the middle of the ones
twenty-five thirty thirty-five billion
dollars which could be intelligent films
with decent enough stars that would
attract a decent audience aren ' t getting
made at the moment the other ones that
I ' ve being squeezed out stand by me
which was released in 1986 never did
more than three and a half million
dollars on any given weekend and wound
up doing 55 million dollars in America
for picture that cost seven and a half
million dollars to make that was an
enormous success and yet if that picture
were released today after if only did
three and a half million dollars the
first weekend after two three weekends
it ' s thrown out of the theater because
there ' s so many more pictures that are
coming that are going to grossed more
than three and a half million in the
first weekend and the theater owners
don ' t care that they ' ve kicked you out
because even if the picture that they
just put in to replace you doesn ' t do
well they got another one to replace
that they don ' t have that passion that
you that you hear about and certain
people that these people that serve
founded the industry and even as a few
years ago that you could find pockets of
people that you that were in charge and
that you could talk to and so I do think
it ' s basically harder although at the
same time technology and people being
able to do their own films and digital
it has opened it up more so I think that
interesting time and I do think there ' s
more interesting things may be going on
now than there has in the past so it ' s a
you know like any like anything it goes
through its phases
is still in our lifetime and maybe even
sooner you won ' t need anything except a
computer keyboard to create any type of
spectacle and then it ' s going to
ultimately come down to the vision of
the filmmaker because he ' ll be able to
do anything I think that it ' s the
texture and the experience of working
with film that will create a breed of
digital filmmakers that will have some
kind of reverence towards the more
traditional modes of storytelling that
really do work it ' s just a matter of the
that the the the art moving as it will
gracefully with the technology well
the independent film scene has taken on
the burden of doing decent movies and
there are great films coming out of
independent world there ' s a lot of
darkness a lot of chicanery and finality
in the film business there just is a lot
of things that you just assume not know
about human people but there ' s also a
lot of wonderful wonderful care and love
especially among I think cast and crew
that is there and that will sustain you
through a lot of very very dark moments
there were two Siamese twins through
fellows and they wanted to be racecar
drivers and they lived in Indiana and
the dream of the Siamese twins racecar
drivers from Indiana is that they
someday would drive in London so the
other brother could drive the car
I think dreams are very important even
if people don ' t understand them and
somebody has to be what is the power in
Hollywood is it being on the list of
most powerful people many who are in
rehab or is it some thing that you have
the most money and you ' re paying a lot
of alimony what is the power in
Hollywood oh you have this wonderful
family I think the power in Hollywood is
to have the passion that you believe in
the project you ' re doing so much that
you can convince everybody around to do
it your way after you listen that I ' m a
minute then say here ' s what I see and
the power Hollywood is to get what you
see up there on the screen the way you
see it
that ' s the real
of Hollywood whether it ' s a hit or miss
is irrelevant but to get it up on the
screen that ' s the power of a filmmaker
to get it up on the screen the way he
wants it
