The Importance of Proper Attire
Making the BEST possible impression is paramount 
when seeking employment ! Even though we would 
like to think that our skills and abilities get us the 
job , appearance does count . First impressions are 
made within five minutes of meeting someone and 
help shape all future impressions , so it is important 
to dress professionally . This allows the employer 
to focus on your skills and abilites and not your 
clothing . The National Association of Colleges and 
Employers ( NACE ) surveyed 457 employers who 
recruit new college graduates and an overwhelming 
92 percent believed a candidate ’ s overall appearance 
influences their opinion about that candidate . It can 
be helpful to always dress for the job you want ! 
Learn the Employer ’ s Dress Style
Looking the part can help you make a good first 
impression . Knowing what is expected takes a little 
research , a shopping trip , and a full-length mirror . 
1 . Research the culture of the employer . A more 
conservative employer ( accounting , finance , law , 
etc .  ) will require more conservative dress . A more 
creative employer ( retail , advertising , etc .  ) might 
offer more flexibility in dress . 
2 . Look at the brochures , websites , and employees 
of the organization to guide your dress style . 
What style of clothes are being worn by the 
people who work there ? What image are they 
projecting with their clothing ? 
3 . Trust your instincts when selecting your 
interview attire . If you have to ask the question 
 “ Can I wear this ?  ” then the answer should always 
be “ No .  ” 
4 . Err on the conservative side when in doubt about 
what to wear . 
5 . Avoid extremes . Low-cut blouses , sky-high 
stilettos , and miniskirts are inappropriate . 
6 . Ask experts at a clothing store about the fit of 
your suit . It shouldn ’ t be too loose or too tight . 
7 . Purchase a quality suit . It is better to buy one 
good suit than several inexpensive suits . 
8 . Always try on your entire outfit prior to 
the interview day , looking for any flaws or 
weaknesses in your appearance . Don ’ t forget to 
look at the back of your outfit to ensure you have 
a polished look coming and going .

Business Attire
Business attire is the written ( or unwritten ) dress code of an organization . Business attire suggests a formal , 
conservative dress style . It is expected when interviewing with an employer unless stated otherwise . Attention 
to detail , impeccable grooming , and a well-fitted suit are vital to make a good lasting impression . 
Men ’ s Interview Attire – Back to the Basics
1 . The Suit : 
y Choose a neutral suit in 
charcoal , navy , or gray . Black 
suits , while in style and 
acceptable , are less appropriate 
for an interview . 
y The pant leg should touch the 
front of the shoe and fall just 
above the heel in the back . 
y Pants can be cuffed or uncuffed . 
y The fabric of the suit should 
be gabardine or wool . Blended 
material is acceptable , but avoid 
cotton blends as they wrinkle . 
y The suit jacket should be 
buttoned while standing and 
unbuttoned to sit . Do not button 
the bottom button of a three or 
two-button suit . 
y Avoid suits with doublebreasted jackets . 
2 . The Dress Shirt : 
y Choose shirts in white , ecru , or 
light blue . 
y Have your shirt professionally 
laundered . 
y Always wear a long sleeve shirt . 
y Pointed collars give a more 
professional image than button 
down collars , yet both are acceptable . 
y Avoid shirts with insignias . 
y Your shirt sleeve should extend beyond the 
suit jacket sleeves by ½ inch . 
y Always wear a crewneck undershirt as they 
give the appearance of a finished look . 
3 . The Tie : 
y Wear a conservative tie with subtle patterns 
or solid colors . 
y Ties should be of good quality and 
made of 100% silk . 
y The tie should be darker than 
your shirt . 
y The tie should fall to the middle of 
your belt . 
4 . Socks , Shoes , and Belt : 
y Wing tips or lace-up conservative 
shoes are the most appropriate .  
Loafers should be used for business 
casual . 
y Choose black , brown , or cordovan 
shoes . Shoe color should match your 
suit or be slightly darker . 
y Shoes should be in good condition 
and polished . 
y Socks should match the color of your 
suit and cover your calves . 
y Belts should be in good condition and 
match the color of your shoes . 
5 . Accessories : 
y Men should limit accessories / jewelry 
to three pieces . 
y Accessories include watch , ring ,  
handkerchief , lapel pins , cuff links ,  
and tie tacks . A dress watch should be 
worn – avoid athletic styles . 
y Avoid bracelets , necklaces , and visible 
piercings . 
6 . Grooming : 
y Facial hair should be neatly trimmed 
( mustache , sideburns )  ; beards are not 
recommended for an interview . 
y Hair should be neat and conservative , not 
touching the collar of your shirt . 
y Heavy cologne should be avoided . Soap and 
antiperspirant will allow the interviewer to 
remember you , not your scent . 
y Nails should be clean and manicured . 
Dressing to Impress 3
Women ’ s Interview Attire 
– Fit in , Don ’ t Stand Out
1 . The Suit : 
y Choose a classic 
suit , avoiding 
trendy suit styles . 
y For a conservative 
organization , 
a skirt suit is 
still considered 
the appropriate 
interview attire . 
A pantsuit , while 
acceptable for some 
organizations , is 
still considered less 
formal . 
y Hemlines should 
be knee length or 
longer . Miniskirts 
are inappropriate 
and give the 
impression that 
you are not 
serious about the 
interview . 
y Choose wool or 
gabardine . 
y You are not limited 
to a dark-colored 
suit , but remember 
the rule – if you 
have to ask yourself “ Can I ?  ” then don ’ t . 
y Make sure the suit flatters your figure and fits 
well , not too tight or loose . 
y Jacket sleeves should fall half an inch below 
your wrist . 
2 . The Blouse : 
y Blouses should be current , but neither lowcut nor revealing . 
y Do not wear a camisole or sheer blouse . 
3 . Shoes and Hose : 
y Wear pumps or sling backs . Avoid sandals or 
shoes with open toes or ankle straps . 
y Shoes should be of good quality , preferably 
leather . 
y Shoe color should match your suit or be 
slightly darker . 
y Heels should be 1-2 inches ; higher heels 
should be saved for after hours . 
4 . Accessories : 
y Jewelry should be minimal and conservative . 
Remove all facial piercing except earrings . 
y Wear only five accessories . Earrings count 
as two and a watch is the third , allowing 
two additional accessories . Do not overaccessorize . 
5 . Make-up and Grooming : 
y Makeup should be natural and conservative . 
Avoid overly dark or bright eyeshadow and 
lipstick . 
y Nails should be clean and manicured . Avoid 
very long nails , nail art , and trendy or bright 
nail polish . 
y Hair should be clean and neat . 
y Perfume should be applied very lightly if at 
all . A good soap and antiperspirant will allow 
the interviewer to remember you , not your 
scent . 
Business Casual
Business casual is an oxymoron ! Dress code policies 
have been changing for the last decade . Dressing 
more casually is meant to make life easier , but 
confusion over appropriate attire has caused many 
employers to adopt some type of business casual 
standard . Whether it is casual Fridays , shirts with 
the organization ’ s logo , or a guide for acceptable 
dress , the casual dress code is becoming more 
defined . Candidates seeking employment with an 
organization may be instructed to wear “ business 
casual ” to a particular event during the interview 
process without receiving any guidelines to follow . 
Read on for examples of acceptable business casual 
attire . 
Women – Acceptable Attire : 
y Pantsuits are a wise choice for a business 
casual event ( information session , facility 
tour , etc .  )  . 
y A classic sheath paired with a cardigan or a 
blazer in the same fabric and color is a good 
choice . 
y Crisp cotton shirts in white , chambray , and 
chartreuse paired with dress pants , khakis , or 
skirts make an appropriate casual outfit . 
y Cardigan twin sets are also an easy way 
to dress more casually while still looking 
professional . 
y Jewelry , scarves , and other accessories will 
add polish to any outfit , but remember that 
less is more . 
y Shoes should still be well-made and closetoed . Flats are appropriate . 
y Hose are not essential for business casual , but 
recommended for shorter skirts . Skirts should 
still fall near the knee . 
y Wear trouser socks with pants . 
Men – Acceptable Attire : 
y A sports coat creates a pulled together look in 
a business casual environment and eliminates 
the need for a tie . Pair the sports coat with 
khakis or dark slacks . 
y Traditional dress slacks ( khakis , Dockers , 
corduroys , wool , and linen ) are appropriate 
with or without a blazer . Be sure to press 
them beforehand . 
y Casual , button-down oxford shirts are a great 
alternative to dress shirts , with or without a tie . Choose basic white , chambray , or 
pinstripe . 
y Oxfords and loafers in brown or black are a 
good match for khakis and corduroys . 
Unacceptable Attire : 
y Jeans , denim pants , or shorts
y Leggings , stretch or stirrup pants , sweats , 
spandex , or other form-fitting attire
y Athletic shoes , hiking boots , sandals , or flip 
flops
y Flannel shirts or T-shirts
y Hats / caps
y Mini skirts
y Low-cut tops
