Abstract : This research explores one avenue for achieving 
sustainability within the fashion industry ; which as it exists today is 
unsustainable . The Slow Fashion movement has an existing foundation 
in the larger fashion industry and is already making strides towards 
sustainability . The authors used this opportunity to examine a strategic 
approach , as its current approach is ad hoc . First , the authors assessed 
the Slow Fashion movement using the 5 level Framework for Strategic 
Sustainable Development . To analyze the Slow Fashion movement 
further , the concept of Leverage Points was used to provide a focused 
lens to assist the author ’ s in navigating through the fashion industry ’ s 
complex system . Findings were synthesized into thirty strategic 
recommendations that target various players in the Slow Fashion 
movement . Three key recommendations will provide the most leverage 
in strengthening the Slow Fashion movement : 1 ) Co-create Slow 
Fashion Principles to represent the values of the movement and a shared 
definition of sustainability 2 ) Establish an overarching global network 
and local chapters for the Slow Fashion movement 3 ) Harmonize global 
garment and textile labelling initiatives under a Slow Fashion label . 
Keywords : Slow Fashion , Sustainable fashion , Strategic Sustainable 
Development , Slow Fashion Principles , Leverage Points , Slow

Statement of Collaboration
This thesis is the result of an intense collaboration between Carlotta , 
Maureen and Crystal . Our professional backgrounds are very different , 
coming respectively from the worlds of fashion , sustainability and design . 
Each individual added depth and competence to the collective research . All 
team members joyfully dove into the project and undertook equal parts of 
the literature review , consistently supplying summaries to the rest of the 
team and encouraging discussions and ideas for further exploration . 
Carlotta ’ s previous experience in the fashion industry gave the team access 
to invaluable insight ; she dug deeply into the details of our group 
discussions to offer her understanding of complex concepts , and challenged 
results and recommendations to ensure they were well thought out and 
understandable to our audience . Despite being the only non-native English 
speaker , she also took great pleasure in correcting grammar and spelling 
mistakes throughout the paper . Maureen ’ s ability for designing surveys and 
organizing results naturally elected her for this role . Thanks to her research 
and writing skills she has also taken much responsibility in editing the 
paper and ensuring clear , comprehensive and applicable results . Crystal , the 
team ’ s IT , design and organizational genius , took care of perfecting every 
image in the thesis , the documents sent to external advisors , and the website 
created for this occasion . She also led the way in effectively coordinating 
group meetings , agenda ’ s and tasks . 
The process of analyzing the results and elaborating the recommendations 
often involved creative and exhausting brainstorms , but it always led us to 
reach consensus and a deeper overall understanding of the subject area . 
Overall , we recognize that writing a thesis in three is challenging but it has 
been a priceless and enriching experience ; we feel especially grateful for 
the opportunity . We also hope that the collaboration that began during this 
program and consolidated in the thesis period will continue well beyond the 
end of this project .

Executive Summary
Background
Fashion is an innate part of individual expression and it is a cultural 
reflection of a point in time . Although fashion plays a central role in our 
society , today ’ s industry– which is dominated by the globalized Fast 
Fashion industry – is contributing to the sustainability challenge . 
The fashion industry has begun to tackle some of the challenges by 
implementing initiatives , however , the authors recognize that these actions 
are tied to a system rooted in rising consumerism , which is being 
confronted with population growth , diminishing natural resources and 
climate change . There has been an emergence of ethical ,  “ eco ” and 
sustainable fashion designers , brands and retailers . But overall , the 
consumer awareness of the impacts of the fashion industry is quite low and 
sustainable fashion is still a niche market ( Defra 2008 )  . 
The Slow Fashion movement has been recognized as one avenue for 
achieving sustainability in the fashion industry . The slow approach 
encourages taking time to ensure responsible production ; it adds value to 
the garment through quality design and encourages contemplating its 
connection with the environment and the garment maker ( Fletcher 2007 ; 
Honoré 2004 )  . It is unique in that it includes the consumer in the supply 
chain , as a co-producer , to foster personal connections and an overall 
awareness of the production process . Slow fashion is based on the Slow
Food movement in particular and other slow movements in general . It is a 
new model that aims to assemble eco , ethical and sustainable fashion into 
one movement , in order to meet fundamental human needs , while allowing 
for the earth ’ s natural regeneration to take place . 
Purpose and Research Questions
This thesis is intended to inspire a broad audience in the fashion industry 
but it is specifically targeting Slow Fashion designers , brands , suppliers , 
buyers , manufacturers and retailers and co-producers . The overall research 
aim is to strengthen the Slow Fashion movement by providing strategic 
guidance on how it can move towards a sustainable vision , rooted in 
science . A primary research question has been developed and is supported 
by three secondary research questions : 
v
How can a Strategic Sustainable Development ( SSD ) approach be used to 
strengthen Slow Fashion ’ s strategic move towards sustainability ? 
• What does the FSSD reveal about the Slow Fashion industry and its 
move towards sustainability ? 
• How can Leverage Points be used to strengthen Slow Fashion ' s
contribution to a sustainable society ? 
• Based on the above findings , what strategic recommendations can 
be made to the Slow Fashion industry ? 
Methods
The research methods utilized an interactive approach to assess the Slow 
Fashion movement . The authors drew on a conceptual framework based 
on Strategic Sustainable Development . The research was continually 
adapted throughout the process as new information , perspectives and 
insights surfaced . The conceptual framework included systems thinking , the 
Five Level Framework for Strategic Sustainable Development ( System , 
Success , Strategic Guidelines , Actions , Tools )  , and key components of 
SSD , such as the four Sustainability Principles and ‘ backcasting ’ from 
future success ( Holmberg et al . 2000 )  . 
The concept of Leverage Points , developed by scientist and system-thinker 
Donella Meadows , was also used to pin-point places to intervene in the 
Fashion industry , and society at large , to create a system change in favor of 
strengthening the Slow Fashion movement . 
Research results were gathered in four phases . Phase one consisted of an 
assessment of Slow Fashion ’ s move towards sustainability using the FSSD , 
where particular focus was placed on the ‘ System , Success , and Strategic 
Guidelines ’ levels . At the Actions and Tools level , the authors acknowledge 
that a variety of actions and tools , which are bringing the movement 
towards sustainability have already emerged . A literature review and 
evidence from an industry survey provided the authors with a solid 
understanding of the current state of the Slow Fashion movement in relation 
to these five levels . 
Phase two reviewed each of the 12 Leverage Points that were currently 
being used to strengthen the Slow Fashion movement , and the potential 
barriers and gaps preventing the success of each Leverage Point . The 
references from the literature review in Phase one were used and filtered 
into the analysis of the Leverage Points . Additionally , the industry survey 
vi
was a key source of information . Expert interviews also provided valuable 
insight on a number of specific topic areas . 
Phase three determined the strategic recommendations for players in the 
Slow Fashion movement . Using the findings discovered during the first two 
research phases , the authors conducted brainstorming sessions to develop 
recommendations that addressed both the Leverage Points and the FSSD . 
Phase four was an extension of one of the key recommendations developed 
in phase three : to co-create Slow Fashion Principles . It was recognized that 
this phase needed to be initiated and the principles were unearthed from 
what is occurring within the Slow Fashion movement . To begin validating 
and co-creating the principles , an expert panel of people working in 
sustainable fashion , the slow movements and sustainability in general 
provided sound insight and feedback . 
Results
Phase 1 : FSSD . From our assessment using the FSSD , it is clear at the 
System level that the Slow Fashion players are aware of their connections 
with the natural environment and society – from the workers in the supply 
chain to the communities that they operate in . At the Success level , the 
movement does not have a common vision of future success , or a clear 
definition of sustainability . Therefore , at the Strategic Guidelines level , the 
Slow Fashion movement is not being strategic in its actions to achieve 
sustainability and is unable to backcast from success . At the Actions and 
Tools level , there are numerous sustainability initiatives occurring . 
Phase 2 : Leverage Points . At the higher Leverage Points , the Slow Fashion 
movement is creating buffers of more sustainable materials such as organic 
cotton , bamboo , hemp and flax . Also , all survey respondents were 
interested in sourcing more of these in the future , however they are 
generally more expensive . There is also a delay in increasing the supply of 
renewable fibres and developing natural dyes caused by technology and 
skill development barriers . Localized supply chains in addition to textile 
up-cycling , is supporting Slow Fashion material flows . But , it is still more 
cost-effective to source textiles from developing countries , and creating 
new supply chain structures is very challenging and time consuming . 
A positive-reinforcing loop , triggered by increased media , marketing and 
awareness can be used to increase the demand for Slow Fashion . 
Information flows can be a very effective point of intervention , especially , 
vii
if new information is being delivered on sustainability and the benefits of 
Slow Fashion within the supply chain and to co-producers . But , there is a 
lack of clear information on the sustainability impacts of the supply chain , 
and it is difficult to compare the fibres and dying processes . Slow fashion 
designers / brands are communicating information to co-producers , but the 
overall awareness of Slow Fashion is still quite low and awareness 
campaigns are concentrated in only a few countries . 
Overall , there are not enough rules to limit pollution in the fashion supply 
chain , and enforcement is low – resulting in lower retail prices for Fast 
Fashion . Slow fashion producers are going above and beyond 
environmental standards , thus their prices are not as competitive . As well , 
organic and Fair Trade certifications and labelling schemes are too 
expensive and time consuming for small brands , and moreover the 
awareness of these eco-labels between co-producers is quite low . 
At the most influential Leverage Points , the Slow Fashion movement is 
beginning to self-organize from grassroots initiatives , and innovative , 
forward-thinking small brands , but it still needs strategic organization to 
succeed as an officially recognized movement . It relies on a diversity of 
materials , ideas , business models and each business surveyed had different 
goals and purposes ; however , an overarching theme of willing to contribute 
to a more sustainable society emerged from survey ’ s result . 
Lastly , Slow Fashion presents an alternative paradigm to the current fashion 
model by establishing new mental models in society that satisfy 
fundamental human needs , instead of market wants , while allowing for the 
earth ’ s natural regeneration to take place . 
Phase 3 : Strategic Recommendations . Based on the findings in Phase one 
and two , thirty short , medium and long-term strategic recommendations 
were created to strengthen the Slow Fashion movement and to move it 
towards sustainability . Each recommendation is targeted at a specific group 
of Slow Fashion players and taps into one , or a combination of Leverage 
Points . Of these , three key recommendations have been identified as 
bringing the most leverage the Slow Fashion movement : 1 ) Co-create a 
vision of success for the Slow Fashion movement 2 ) Establish an 
overarching Slow Fashion network 3 ) Harmonize global labelling 
initiatives under a Slow Fashion garment label . 
Phase 4 : Slow Fashion Principles . To initiate the first recommendation , ten 
principles for Slow Fashion have been discovered to begin this co-creation 
viii
process . They are intended to provide inspiration and guidance for Slow 
Fashion players and those wishing to join the movement to contribute to a 
sustainable society . 
Discussion 
The Slow Fashion Principles will be further co-created amongst those 
working directly in the industry . Although individual businesses hold 
unique goals , it is understood that the overall purpose of the Slow Fashion 
movement is to contribute to a sustainable society . By participating in the 
co-creation process , Slow Fashion players will connect to this greater 
purpose and to others that are working towards the same goal . As well , 
spreading the vision1 
is a strategic step towards creating a shared mental 
model and common definition of sustainability . The principles can be 
shared though existing online networks , community events and workshops . 
The Slow Fashion movement is addressing the Leverage Points discussed 
above and using some of them very effectively , however , they may be 
doing so unknowingly . These strategic recommendations are offered to 
assist Slow Fashion players to tap into their full potential , and address 
barriers and gaps , to strengthen the overall movement . The three 
recommendations that will provide the most leverage will be challenging to 
achieve , however , it is recognized that they are the most strategic and will 
strengthen the movement considerably . Overall , these recommendations 
will require the utmost collaboration between individual designers and their 
supply chains , governments , certification bodies , NGOs and online hubs 
among others . Overall , the increased interconnectivity of the movement 
will allow for Slow Fashion to emerge as a vibrant , robust and truly 
sustainable fashion model for the future . 
Conclusion
The existing Slow Fashion movement has initiatives popping up 
worldwide . If these initiatives merge together in a strategic way , as 
proposed in this thesis , Slow Fashion could be the sustainable fashion 
model that helps society move toward sustainability .

The ten Slow Fashion Principles and the four Sustainability Principles
ix
Glossary
Anthropogenic : Human induced . 
Backcasting :  ‘ Planning from success ’ by starting with the desired future 
and asking ourselves “ what do we need to do to get from here to there ?  ” 
Balancing Feedback Loop : A stabilizing feedback loop , also known as a 
 “ negative feedback loop ”  . It balances the direction of system change . 
Consumer : See co-producer . 
Co-producer : An end-user in the supply chain . This term will be used 
instead of ‘ consumer ’ in this report , as it is acknowledges that the end users 
are deeply involved in the production process ; by including them in the 
supply chain , it also includes them in sharing responsibility and gives them 
access to transparent information . 
Eco / sustainable / ethical fashion industry : Different terms for an industry 
that manufactures clothing using environmentally friendly processes 
( upcycling , recycling , local fabrics , locally production , natural fabrics and 
dyes , inspiration drawn from nature )  , organic textiles ( i . e . hemp ) and non–
textile materials ( i . e . bamboo or recycled plastic bottles )  . 
Fashion industry : This industry includes farmers , clothing manufacturers 
and suppliers , buyers , retailers , consumers and co-producers . It 
encompasses all types of fashion production , from Fast to Slow Fashion . 
Fast Fashion : Clothing industry focused on low cost mass-production . It is 
sold by retailers at very low prices and is based on the latest trends , which 
encourages consumers to purchase more than they need resulting in 
external environmental and social impacts . 
Framework for Strategic Sustainable Development ( FSSD )  : Refers to 
the five-level framework that has been adopted to plan strategically towards 
sustainability within the system “ Society within the ecosphere ”  . The five 
levels are : System , Success , Strategic Guidelines , Actions and Tools . 
Living Wage : Where the earnings from a standard working week are 
sufficient to meet the basic needs of workers and their dependence . This is 
typically higher than a set minimum wage ( Baldwin and Williams 2008 )  . 
x
Multi-local : Where “ global ” is made up of a network of “ local systems ” of 
alternative initiatives with common characteristics . Whatever is locally 
available is used to best advantage and whatever cannot be produced locally 
is exchanged and shared , giving rise to a society and an economy that is at 
the same time both local and cosmopolitan ( Slow + Design 2006 )  . 
Organic : Raw materials that have been grown without the use of pesticides 
and are certified by a third party . The term organic can be solely referred to 
the source of raw materials , not to the processes the fibre then undergoes . 
Production : Includes the entire supply chain from farmer to co-producer . 
Raw material : A natural , unprocessed material used in a manufacturing 
process . 
Reflective Consumption : A term utilized in Slow Design that means 
reflecting about the utility of a product to ensure that the purchase is really 
needed . 
Reinforcing Feedback Loop : An amplifying / enhancing feedback loop , 
also known as “ positive feedback loop ”  . It reinforces the direction of 
system change . These are both vicious cycles and virtuous cycles . 
Slow Fashion : A decelerated fashion movement . In this paper the term 
Slow Fashion represents a more compact and strategic model for the 
eco / sustainable / ethical fashion industry . Pivotal to the Slow Fashion 
movement is the co-participation of the consumer in the supply chain 
allowing people to satisfy their fundamental human needs while not 
contributing to the systematic degradation of the ecosphere . 
Sustainability Principles : Refers to basic principles for socio-ecological 
sustainability to define the minimum requirements of a sustainable society . 
System : A set of elements or parts that are organized and interconnected 
that produces a characteristic set of behaviours . 
Systems Thinking : A scientific discipline which looks at the whole rather 
then analyzing the different parts of a system . It helps understand complex 
problems . 
xi
Vertically Integrated : Form of business organization where all stages of 
production of a good , from the acquisition of raw materials to the retailing 
of the final product , are controlled by one company .

1 Introduction 
1 . 1 What is Fashion and why does it exist ? 
Individuals , especially when belonging to different cultural backgrounds , 
can interpret fashion very differently . In fact , as humans , we have a distinct 
need to dress ourselves ; it is how our clothing reflects and communicates 
our individual views within society , linking us to time and space , that is the 
essence of fashion ( Fletcher 2008 )  . Fashion ’ s role in society is so deeply 
rooted that its existence is likely to continue well into the future . 
1 . 1 . 1 Fashion and Culture 
Fashion is embedded in our system of communication ; it is created with 
human intelligence , creativity , and our innate desire to express ourselves 
( Hethorn 2008 ) and transcend our body ’ s limitations ( Wilson 2003 , pg 3 )  . 
Clothing is the material item that gives fashion a visual context in society . 
It is one of many cultural artefacts that tells a story of human development 
throughout history , and can offer a snapshot of society at a point in time , 
unfolding collective thoughts , styles , and memories , similar to art and 
photography ( Wilson 2003 )  . 
During the past 200 years , sparked by the Industrial Revolution , and the 
introduction of mechanical innovations such as the mechanical weaving , 
the sewing machine and standardized sizes in clothing , producing and 
consuming fashion in a accelerated and accessible way has become 
progressively mainstream and has evolved into the fashion scenario we are 
witnessing today . 
1 . 1 . 2 Fashion and Human Needs 
The use and consumption of material goods , including fashion goods is 
correlated to the attempt of individuals to meet their human needs , which 
are an intrinsic part of human nature . The satisfying of these needs can help 
people to have emotionally rich , healthy lives ( Max-Neef 1991 )  . 
Several researchers have proposed different classifications of human needs , 
but the theory of Chilean economist Manfred Max-Neef is , in the eyes of 
2
the authors , the most comprehensive as it considers nine human needs 
organized in a non-hierarchical way ( except for subsistence )  . These are the 
same for everyone , regardless of culture , religion or historical time ( MaxNeef 1991 )  .

Subsistence Protection Participation

Understanding Identity Freedom
Table 1 . 1 . 9 Basic Human Needs ( Max-Neef 1991 )  . 
Each culture can satisfy their needs in different ways . Max-Neef calls these 
 ‘ satisfiers ’  . Fashion can act as a satisfier for the needs of subsistence and 
protection , which tend to require a minimum level of material throughput . It 
also acts as a satisfier for the needs of identity , creation and participation , 
which could theoretically be satisfied by participatory processes ( personal , 
social and cultural ) rather than by consumption of fashion goods ( Jackson 
1994 )  , which will be explored later in this report . 
As the way of meeting human needs is culturally determined , so is the 
utilization of fashion . Fashion can communicate a message of belonging or 
participation within society . For example , a letterman ’ s jacket displays an 
athlete ’ s identity and belonging to a certain group and policemen ’ uniforms 
indicate they are trusted protectors of peace . 
Fashion is able to satisfy some of our fundamental human needs . However , 
today ’ s more widespread fashion scenario is characterized by identical
trends that dress co-producers all over the world , which automatically 
produces a homogeneous look that is unlikely to satisfy , for example , the 
needs of identity and creativity . Here , fashion would be intended to help 
people differentiate as individuals with a unique and original personal taste , 
but in reality this is not the case . Nevertheless , as today ’ s fashion is so 
affordable , it stands as the most popular option between co-producers . 
1 . 2 Today ’ s Fashion Industry 
Today ' s fashion industry can be primarily characterized by globalized , 
vertically integrated production , generally defined as Fast Fashion . The past 
ten years especially have witnessed an increasing supply of Fast Fashion 
with seasons changing every six weeks rather than releasing the traditional 
3
two seasons per year . The fashion industry ’ s complex supply chain relies 
on resource-intensive material inputs . Natural fibres are harvested across 
the globe while clothing and textile production are primarily located in 
Asia . Overall , the clothing and textile industry employs approximately 26 
million people worldwide , contributes 7% to global exports and is worth 
over US$ 1 trillion ( Allwood et al . 2006 , 2 )  . 
Although the fashion industry is a driver of global economic growth , it also 
significantly impacts the environment , society and cultures . Multinational 
retailers and brands have adopted practices based on trend-driven design , 
massive outsourcing to developing countries , and an inexpensive pricing 
policy , resulting in a dramatic decline of the price of clothing . 
In 2005 , the end of the World Trade Organization ’ s Multi-Fibre 
Agreement resulted in the removal of textile trade quotas . This resulted in 
countries with low labour costs , specifically China , undergoing a surge in 
clothing and textile production ( Ernest et al . 2005 )  . Competition , lower 
labour and production costs combined with technological advances have led 
to a further reduction in retail prices and this has produced an even faster 
increase in consumers ’ demand . 
In fact , consumers ’ attitude and behaviour are in tune with fast production . 
It is known that approximately 16% of consumers are heavily influenced by 
media and are likely to quickly adopt the latest fashion trends ( Morgan and 
Birtwistle 2009 )  . Then , further encouraged by low prices and strongly 
influenced by marketing campaigns that advertise continuously changing 
trends , consumers tend to speed up their consumption of fashion ( Birtwistle 
and Moore 2006 )  , and assume a pivotal role in the current development of 
the Fast Fashion industry . 
As it is important for the research , the term ‘ co-producer ’  , rather than 
consumer or end user will be used throughout the thesis to describe both the 
current fashion model ’ s consumer and the Slow Fashion consumer .  
, - &  .  "  /  +  "  &  " 012341 * $5 ) 46
This term implies that the end user is a vital part of the movement . By 
supporting the Slow Fashion movement through their purchases , the coproducer takes on the responsibility of the environmental and social aspects of 
that purchase . The Slow Food movement first coined this term . 
Figure 1 . 1 . Co-producer definition

1 . 2 . 1 The Sustainability Impacts
It has been remarked above that the current consumptive behaviour of coproducers is causing a variety of ecological and social impacts . To 
understand the scope of the sustainability challenge that confronts today ’ s 
fashion industry a brief overview of the sustainability impacts is presented 
for context . Using a life-cycle approach , from raw material extraction to 
clothing use and disposal , the specific impacts of the industry are described 
below . 
Materials . Clothing is generally made from one or from a combination of 
the following materials : 
• Natural fabrics such as cotton , wool , silk . These require large quantities 
of water and arable land . Cotton is grown in over 100 countries and 
uses approximately 76 million acres of land and 8000 litres of water to 
grow ( Fletcher 2008 , 7 ; Organic Exchange 2009 )  . Pesticides are widely 
used in the growing of conventional cotton ( approximately 80% of the 
cotton sold today ) and they degrade farmers health , soil , water and 
biodiversity ( Draper et al . 2007 , 4 )  ; 
• Man-made fabrics such as cellulose which is made from timber ( i . e . 
viscose , lyocell , bamboo etc .  )  ; 
• Synthetic fabrics that utilize oil to create polymers , such as polyester , 
acrylic , nylon etc . Their manufacturing is an energy-intensive process 
during which volatile organic compounds ( VOC ’ s )  , particulate matter 
and acid gases are released into the air and water ( Claudio 2007 , 450 )  . 
On a positive side , cotton , wool and synthetic fibre production provides 
significant employment and economic benefits to developing and 
developed countries . However , poor working conditions and low wages are 
often commonplace for growers ( Claudio 2007 )  . 
Garment production . Raw materials are exported to developing countries 
where they are woven into fabrics , cut and assembled into garments . 
Chemicals used for bleaching , dyeing , printing or applying finishes to 
fabrics are potentially harmful to the health of workers ; these processes are 
water and energy intensive and untreated waste effluents are often released 
from the factories ( Claudio 2007 )  . 
Distribution . Transportation of textile materials and garments from the 
factories to the shop accounts only for a small portion of the energy in 
5
comparison to the energy used during the use and disposal stages as 
transportation companies have become more efficient ( Draper et al . 2007 )  . 
Retail . Retailers purchase garments either from known suppliers or through 
a third-party vendor . Some retailers apply environmental standards , 
however , when working through third parties retailers are often unaware of 
who their real suppliers are ( Defra 2007 )  . 
The economic landscape of the clothing industry is highly competitive , 
resulting in retailers demanding low production costs from their suppliers . 
Consequently , garment workers are being paid low wages and are often 
subject to poor working conditions . For example , some Chinese garment 
workers are paid only 12-18 cents per hour ( Claudio 2007 )  . Clothing 
retailers and brands play a key role in ensuring the suppliers are treated 
fairly and adhere to environmental , health and safety regulations . 
Use and Disposal . This use and care phase represents a large proportion of 
the life cycle impacts due to the amount of energy , detergents , 
petrochemical based solvents and water used . As the rate at which coproducers are purchasing has escalated and the lifespan of a garment has 
reduced dramatically , the amount of clothing being sent directly to landfills 
has drastically increased in recent years ( Morgan and Birtwistle 2009 )  . 
1 . 2 . 2 The Sustainability Challenge
Due to increasing co-producers ’ demand , the fashion industry currently 
uses a constant throughput of natural resources and human capital to satisfy 
this demand . The overconsumption of the fashion industry contributes to 
the depletion of finite fossil fuels used for production and transportation 
( Allwood et al . 2006 )  . Also , other natural resources like fresh water 
reservoirs are being increasingly exploited for cotton crop production 
( Draper et al . 2007 )  . Additionally , the industry is introducing in a 
systematic way manmade compounds such as pesticides and synthetic 
fibres , increasing their persistent presence in the nature ( Claudio 2007 )  . As 
a result , natural resources are in jeopardy and forests and ecosystems are 
being damaged or destroyed for cotton production , leading to issues such as 
droughts , desertification and not least , climate change , that are affecting 
society at large ( Holmberg et al . 2000 )  . To visualize in a simple way the 
sustainability challenge of the fashion industry , the authors propose the use 
of the funnel metaphor that can demonstrate that if the consumption of the 
current fashion industry keeps increasing at the current rate the impacts on 
the social and ecological environment will also increase . This leads to a 
6
progressively a limited space for the industry to handle these impacts in the 
future and resolve the issues humanity is facing today . This is symbolized 
by the converging walls of the funnel ( see Figure 1 . 2 )  . 
Figure 1 . 2 . The Funnel Metaphor ( Holmberg et al . 2000 )  . 
Using this metaphor we can draw the conclusion that if we do not want to 
 ‘ hit the narrowing walls of the funnel ,  ’ we must re-design the current 
unsustainable practices in society , including the fashion industry . This 
change , if achieved , is likely to result in a gradual return to equilibrium , 
where societal behaviour is finally not in conflict with natural resources and 
the fashion industry can subsist without compromising the health of the 
earth and of people . 
1 . 2 . 3 Sustainability Improvements to-date
Incremental sustainability improvements have been applied at all stages of 
the life cycle – from renewable and organic materials , more efficient textile 
and garment manufacturing to ethical labour standards and recycling 
initiatives . Examples include : 
• High-impact fibres are being replaced with low-chemical , rapidly 
renewable , and low water / energy consuming fibres such as hemp , 
lyocell , wool , plant-based biodegradable PLA ( Fletcher 2008 , 4 )  ; 
• During clothing and textile production , improved environmental 
regulations ( EU IPCC legislation ) have resulted in improvements 
for water and chemical use , air emissions and water effluents 
7 
( European Commission 2009 )  ; 
• The industry has adopted Environmental Management Systems and 
Corporate Social Responsibility ( CSR ) initiatives ; 
• Certification and labelling schemes have been developed for the 
processing of organic textiles such as the GOTS , and the Soil
Association Textile standards ( see appendix E )  ; 
• Many other organizations work towards ethical and social 
guidelines , as well as voluntary codes of conduct , for the fashion 
industry ( see appendix A for a list )  ; 
• A number of brands incorporating sustainable design principles , and 
environmental and social criteria have cropped up , such as 
Patagonia ’ s Common Threads recycling program ( Patagonia 2010 ) 
and Nike ’ s CSR reporting initiatives ( Nike 2010 )  ; 
• Increasing consumer awareness of environmental and social impacts 
of clothing purchases ( Defra 2008 ; TNS Worldpanel 2008 )  . 
Overall , it is notable that the industry has taken considerable steps in order 
to move towards sustainability but the negative effects provoked by its 
business model still largely outweighs the positive actions that have been 
taken and call for improvements in the short term . 
1 . 3 Slow Fashion : towards a Sustainable 
Fashion Industry 
Consumerism is a symptom of our inherently fast-paced production cycle 
and revolves around paradigms that are embedded in today ’ s society . Fast 
production and fast consumption inevitably lead to the systematic decrease 
of resources and increase of waste , thus stressing the capacity of the earth 
of regenerating itself at a natural pace . This is why the ‘ slow approach ’ 
intervenes as a revolutionary process in the contemporary world ; in fact , it 
encourages taking time to ensure quality production , to give value to the 
product and contemplate the processes ’ connection with its environment 
( Honoré 2004 )  . Slow Food stands at the forefront of the Slow movements : 
beginning in 1986 with Carlo Petrini ’ s desire to preserve the cultural 
integrity of cuisine in local regions of Italy , Slow Food has now spread to 
over 132 countries , with more than 100 , 000 members worldwide ( Slow 
Food International 2010 )  . The birth of Slow Food was followed by the 
creation of other Slow movements ( i . e . Slow Design , Slow Production , 
Slow Retail etc ) which share the same goal of decelerating our current rate 
of production , consumption and growth while increasing peoples quality of 
life . The Slow Fashion movement shares many characteristics with the 
8
Slow Food movement : 
• Introduce the ‘ consumer ’ into the supply chain as ‘ co-producer ’  ; 
• Increases the quality of life of all workers in the supply chain , 
guaranteeing their fundamental human rights ; 
• Meets in a more satisfactory way the fundamental human needs 
of co-producers ; in the case of fashion , the needs of identity , 
creativity and participation , encouraging co-producers to 
consume less and act responsibly ; 
• Drastically reduces the amount of raw materials introduced in 
the supply chain , harnessing creativity to find strategic or 
service-based alternatives ; 
• Sources local materials and labour ; 
• Preserves and relearns traditional skills . 
By using the concept of slow in the fashion industry it is possible to reinvigorate a healthy rhythm of production , meaning that the environment 
and people could healthily co-exist and the earth would have the time to 
regenerate during production cycles ( Fletcher 2008 )  . The term Slow 
Fashion was coined in 2007 by Dr . Kate Fletcher , who compared the 
eco / sustainable / ethical fashion industry to the Slow Food movement , 
highlighting the similarity in terms of processes and production ( Fletcher 
2007 )  . 
Slow Fashion is a new model of fashion entirely that focuses on its link 
with human needs , awareness and responsibility . Slow Fashion designs , 
produces , and consumes in a way that acknowledges its impacts on society 
and the environment ( Fletcher 2008 )  . Slow Fashion is emerging as a more 
sustainable alternative to the Fast Fashion industry although it is not yet 
officially recognized and established . Some key achievements of this 
movement are listed below : 
• Several initiatives ( see appendix A ) and organizations supporting 
Slow Fashion have been recently founded such as the Centre for 
Sustainable Fashion ( UK ) that challenges the ‘ status quo ’ of the 
fashion industry through research , releasing reports and a Master ’ s 
program on ‘ Fashion and the Environment ’ created to empower 
young fashion designers . 
• Recently launched online networks ( see appendix B ) are working to 
connect people and businesses that want to participate in creating a 
sustainable future for the fashion industry . 
• Slow Fashion has industry members and researchers behind it who 
have written reports and books on Slow Fashion ( Fletcher 2008 )  . 
9
• Fashion designers ( see appendix C ) worldwide are taking on a slow 
approach , sourcing ethical materials and labour , keeping materials 
out of landfill by reuse , and taking on projects to stimulate 
communities which all have a positive impact on people and the 
environment . Moreover , designers small and large work to create 
awareness among co-producers about the value of Slow Fashion . 
1 . 4 Research Purpose 
As stated , the foundations for the Slow Fashion movement already exist ; 
nevertheless , people working today in the fashion industry still have a 
blurred idea of what eco , ethical and sustainable fashion actually mean 
( Friedman 2010 ) as there is no a clear definition of these terms when 
coupled with the term fashion . 
The authors consider the Slow Fashion movement as the most viable 
alternative to move the fashion industry toward sustainability , as the players 
identified in the previous section are working towards enhancing the 
paradigm of ‘ sustainable fashion ’ as it exists today . Specifically , the 
authors intend to strengthen the movement by strategically connecting , 
under the umbrella of “ Slow Fashion ”  , all those brands and initiatives 
( currently generally labelled as eco , ethical , green or sustainable ) that are 
already united by values but yet lacking a common goal and a definition of 
sustainability that could function as a driver and could ensure the overall 
success of their actions . Therefore , the purpose of this research is to 
strengthen the movement ’ s journey to sustainability by ensuring that 
its approach is strategic . 
1 . 5 Scope 
This thesis is intended to inspire a broad audience in the fashion industry 
but it is specifically targeting the Slow Fashion movement consisting of 
designers , brands , suppliers , buyers , manufacturers , retailers and coproducers . 
The specific goals and expected outcomes from this thesis are to : 
• Determine how the Slow Fashion movement can be strengthened 
using an SSD approach and the Framework for Strategic Sustainable 
Development ( FSSD )  ; 
• Identify the Leverage Points in the fashion industry and society as a 
10
whole that currently benefit the Slow Fashion movement ; 
• Determine the barriers and gaps that prevent the Slow Fashion 
movement from effectively utilizing the Leverage Points ; 
• Provide strategic recommendations to move the Slow Fashion 
movement towards sustainability and increase its presence in the 
fashion market and society at large . 
1 . 6 Research Questions
Primary Research Question : How can a Strategic Sustainable Development 
( SSD ) approach be used to strengthen the Slow Fashion movement and 
ensure that it is moving strategically towards sustainability ? 
Secondary Research Questions : 
RQ1 : What does the FSSD reveal about the Slow Fashion movement and 
its move towards sustainability ? 
RQ2 : How can Leverage Points be used to strengthen Slow Fashion ' s
contribution to a sustainable society ? 
a ) How is each Leverage Points being used by the movement ? 
b ) What are the barriers or gaps preventing the success of each Leverage 
Point ? 
RQ3 : Based on the above findings , what strategic recommendations can be 
made to players in the Slow Fashion movement ? 
1 . 7 Assumptions and Limitations
This thesis will not focus on the current unsustainable Fast Fashion 
industry . It is understood that the Fast Fashion model is central to the 
fashion industry ’ s sustainability challenge . The research scope is focused 
solely on the Slow Fashion system due to its sustainability initiatives 
underway ( see section 1 . 3 )  . It will require the help of sustainability 
practitioners , frameworks and tools to allow its emergence and success over 
the long term . To-date Slow Fashion is a grassroots movement and has been 
written as such in publications , but there is no overarching organization of 
this movement that exists .

2 Methods
2 . 1 Research Design
Our research was guided by the methodology developed by Joseph 
Maxwell in the book ,  “ Qualitative Research Design : An Interactive 
Approach ”  ( 2005 )  . Unlike linear research methods that take a step-by-step 
approach , Maxwell ’ s “ Interactive Model for Research Design ” suggests 
continuous reflection on the research process and results . This thesis is a 
qualitative study , relying on information and data gathering from a wide 
range of methods ( see section 2 . 3 )  . This model allows for the synthesis of 
the data to feed back into the research process to be further assessed for 
validity . As more information is gathered and analyzed , this method has the 
flexibility to adapt the research design as well as the scope , purpose , 
research questions , conceptual framework , and methods as needed . 
Figure 2 . 1 . Interaction Model for Research Design ( Maxwell 2005 )  . 
2 . 2 Conceptual Framework
The following concepts have informed the research teams mental model . 
2 . 2 . 1 Framework for Strategic Sustainable 
Development ( FSSD ) 
The Framework for Strategic Sustainable Development ( FSSD ) 
corresponds to the Generic 5 Level Framework , which can be applied as a 
planning tool in any system ( Figure 2 . 2 )  . Specifically , it is able to bring 
clarity and insight when planning towards sustainability . The key elements 
12
are : 1 ) the establishment of some basic principles of 
sustainability rooted in science , that can provide a 
definition of “ success ”  ( see Success Level )  , and 2 ) the 
development of strategic guidelines that can help 
inform the choice of actions and tools ( Waldron et al .  , 
2008 )  . 
System level . An overarching system perspective is used 
to understand the system we are working within at its 
most basic levels ( Figure 3 . 1 )  . Complexity within the 
system increases as more parts are revealed ; an 
understanding of these parts and their relationships is 
essential for a whole-systems perspective , to 
understand its complexity , connectedness , and to avoid reductionism . An 
understanding of the system is an essential base to understand what success 
is within that system . For the purpose of this thesis , the system is Slow 
Fashion as a subset of the larger fashion industry , which is a subset of 
society , which is a subset of the ecosphere . Each smaller part relies on the 
larger for existence ; hence , everything relies on the ecosphere . 
Success level . In order to plan strategically , one must know to what end one 
is planning towards . It seems that defining where an individual is going 
( having a vision ) is a natural process , however in complex systems this step 
can be overlooked . Having a vision to plan towards , or as the FSSD says ‘ a 
vision to backcast from ’ ensures a step towards a strategic approach . 
Figure 2 . 3 . The Sustainability Principles
As the FSSD is a tool to plan strategically towards sustainability , it utilizes 
4 Sustainability Principles ( see figure 2 . 3 ) to ensure a future vision that is 
sustainable . The principles encourage creativity , as they are not

In In a sustainable society , nature is not subject to systematically increasing :

4 …people are not subject to conditions that systematically undermine their

prescriptive and simply act as boundaries for a future vision to be designed 
within ( Holmberg et al . 2000 )  . These principles were designed to be 
necessary and sufficient to achieve sustainability , they are general so that 
they are widely applicable , they are concrete so as to inspire and guide 
actions and they are non-overlapping to enable a structured analysis of the 
issues ( Holmberg et al . 2000 )  . They have been reached though peer review 
and consensus between scientists worldwide . These principles define 
sustainability by setting restrictions upon the systematic undermining of our 
environmental and social fabric ( Waldron et al . 2008 )  . 
Strategic Guidelines
In the FSSD ,  ‘ backcasting ’ is applied as the overarching strategic approach . 
Backcasting first envisions a desired future ( the vision established at the 
Success level )  , and then plans how to get there from the current situation . 
In order to test if the planned actions are strategic in nature , we can use the 
Three Prioritization Questions : is it a step in the right direction with respect 
to the vision ?  ; is the recommendation a ‘ flexible platform ’ for future 
improvement ?  ; and , is the recommendation likely to produce a sufficient 
return on investment ? The ABCD tool can be used to facilitate this process 
( described at the Tools Level )  . 
Actions Level . At the Actions level we determine tangible actions that move 
us toward our vision . 
Tools Level . At the Tools level we identify tools that can help to better 
understand the system , to facilitate the backcasting process ( i . e . ABCD tool 
and others ) and to support actions . The ABCD is an analytical tool that can 
be particularly useful in the decision making process and planning towards 
sustainability , and can be suitable for tackling problems in complex systems 
( i . e . an organization , society at large )  . In ‘ Step A ’ an awareness of entire 
system is established .  ‘ Step B ’ determines the current reality , which is 
looked at through the lens of ‘ success ’  ( the Sustainability Principles )  , to 
discover what exists unsustainably and needs to be addressed , and also 
those actions that are already working towards sustainability . In ‘ Step C ’ 
brainstorming takes place to determine ‘ success ’ and many possible 
creative actions that can help achieve success .  ‘ Step D ’ prioritizes the 
measures generated in ‘ Step C ’ by utilizing three Prioritization Questions .

2 . 2 . 2 Leverage Points
In addition to the employment of the FSSD as a method to analyze the 
current system and develop recommendations for the future , the authors 
considered the potential of a concept developed by scientist Donella 
Meadows , who developed a set of 12 Leverage Points to intervene in 
complex systems ( figure 2 . 4 )  . Leverage Points are places within the system 
that can be utilized to generate 
system change in a strategic way 
( Meadows 1991 )  . As the Slow 
Fashion movement is a complex 
system that is intrinsically 
connected to our society and the 
ecosphere , this concept acts as an 
organizing factor to the research 
and a lens to look through to help 
identify areas of potential power 
for system change . It identifies 
areas the Slow Fashion movement 
acts upon to contribute towards a 
sustainable society and those that 
have yet to be utilized .

To discover the answer to three secondary research questions in a strategic 
manner , the research was prioritized into three phases . Each phase utilizes a 
different set of research methods to search and synthesize data to answer it . 
2 . 3 . 1 Phase 1
To answer RQ 1 : What does the FSSD reveal about the Slow Fashion 
movement and its move towards sustainability ? Here , FSSD analysis and 
literature review were undertaken . 
FSSD : A thorough review of the Slow Fashion movement through the lens 
of the FSSD was applied to determine how and if it is currently behaving 
strategically . 
Literature review : This literature review helped to determine what the 
current reality of the Slow Fashion movement was in relation to the five 
levels of the FSSD . Information was collected and synthesized from 
academic journals , industry and consumer reports , books , websites , and 
magazine articles . The literature review focused on Internet-based search 
databases , including ELIN ( accessed from the BTH Library website )  , 
LIBRIS ( accessed from the BTH Library website ) and Google 
( www . google . com )  . In addition , the authors searched the Journal of Cleaner 
Production and the Clothing and Textiles Research Journal , as well as the 
websites of Centre for Sustainable Fashion , the Ethical Fashion Forum , Eco 
Textile News , Ecouterre , Eco Fashion World and others . 
Search words : Slow Fashion , Slow Food , sustainable fashion , ethical 
fashion , Leverage Points , Fair Trade , organic cotton , eco-labelling , textile 
regulations , Slow Design , eco-design , sustainable fibres , consumer 
behaviour , new technologies , Slow Fashion networks , human needs , 
community development , consumer behaviour , cradle to cradle , fashion and 
( fair wage , ethical work conditions , culture , heritage , skills , social equity , 
textiles )  . Supporting literature on Strategic Sustainable Development , 
Systems Thinking , FSSD , and Slow movements were utilized . 
2 . 3 . 2 Phase 2 
For an in depth review of RQ2 : How can Leverage Points be used to 
strengthen Slow Fashion ’ s contribution to a sustainable society ? and its 
sub questions : a ) How is each Leverage Point being used by the 
movement ?  , b ) What are the barriers or gaps preventing the success of each 
Leverage Point ?  , many methods were utilized such as literature review , 
16
survey , interviews , Leverage Points , data analysis and online networking . 
Literature review : The sources from the literature review in Phase 1 were 
also used to analyze the Slow Fashion movement through the lens of 
 ‘ twelve points to intervene in a system ’ developed by Donella Meadows . 
Our initial findings for Leverage Points were based on a research conducted 
by Dr . Kate Fletcher in the publication :  “ Sustainable Fashion and Textile : 
Design Journey ’ s ” and from the “ Lifetimes ” project . Additionally , recent 
research reports from the Centre for Sustainable Fashion and Forum for the 
Future ( Fashion Futures 2025 Project ) provided a foundation to determine 
the Leverage Points that are being utilized and the Leverage Points that are 
underutilized . Industry and consumer reports , and retail / brand websites 
also provided information to fill in additional research gaps and to provide 
further information on Leverage Points . 
Industry survey : An online industry survey was developed using Survey 
Monkey ( an online survey tool ) to deepen the knowledge on the Leverage 
Points being used by the fashion industry , beyond what was found in the 
literature review . An analysis of the survey results also provided a 
foundation for determining the strategic recommendations ( RQ3 )  . 
To gain an industry-wide perspective of the survey topics , the survey was 
targeted at fashion designers , brands , buyers , manufacturers , retailers , and 
NGOs . A list of professionals in the Slow Fashion movement was 
generated based on an assessment of business operations and design 
processes from company websites and industry reports , the survey was then 
distributed via email to 120 professionals in the Slow Fashion movement , 
located across Europe , Canada , and the United States . 
To expand the survey reach , it was also widely distributed through various 
online networks ( such as THREADS Gazette , the Ethical Fashion Forum , 
the Centre for Sustainable Fashion blog , the thesis blog 
( www . slowfashionforward . tumblr . com )  , Twitter and Facebook )  . During 
March 28-April 12th , 2010 , Forty-six people submitted the survey , and of 
this , thirty fully completed responses were received . For a summary of the 
survey results see appendix F . 
Interviews : To expand on the topics covered in the industry survey and to 
gather more in depth knowledge into key issues , a number of industry 
professionals were contacted for telephone interviews . These interviews 
contributed a wealth of knowledge and brought forth the emergence of the 
17
most effective Leverage Points that could be used to strengthen the Slow 
Fashion movement and contributed to the development of strategic 
recommendations ( RQ3 )  . The industry interviews were conducted during 
March –April 2010 . For a list of interviewees see appendix D . 
Leverage Points : The concept of Leverage Points was reviewed during the 
literature review for this phase . The 12 Leverage Points acted as a lens to 
organize and analyze the data collected in this phase . 
Online Networking : Through our thesis blog , multiple people looking for 
information on the Slow Fashion movement contacted us and shared their 
thoughts and insights , which filtered into our research scope and provided 
validation . We were also able to share our survey through Twitter and by 
posting it to virtual networks as described above . 
2 . 3 . 3 Phase 3 
RQ3 : Based on the above findings , what strategic recommendations can be 
made to the Slow Fashion movement ? 
Brainstorming : Our research team discussed our results through the lens of 
the FSSD , specifically the Strategic Guidelines level and its 3 Prioritization 
Questions to determine our final recommendations . 
Online Networking : As discussed above , we received feedback on ideas 
posted on our blog : SlowFashionForward . tumblr . com . This feedback was 
from people conducting on-line research for information on Slow Fashion , 
and the interactions influenced the development of the recommendations . 
2 . 3 . 4 Phase 4 
To initiate the co-creation of Slow Fashion Principles
Literature review : Another literature review was undertaken to build on the 
research conducted under the ‘ Success ’ level of the FSSD . Here we begin 
to compile our findings of an initial ‘ vision ’ for the Slow Fashion 
movement . The principles of Slow Food , Slow Design , Slow Theory , 
Biomimicry and Permaculture , between others , were reviewed to contribute 
to the discovery of Slow Fashion Principles , in order to accompany RQ3 . 
Online Networking : Our first and second drafts of the Principles were 
posted to our blog and spread through twitter to generate feedback . 
18
Brainstorming : Our own thoughts contributed to the development of the 
Principles , as we are co-producers , thus have a stake in the industry . We 
also infused our knowledge of systems thinking and complex systems into 
the development to ensure they were robust and in line with the 
sustainability principles in the ‘ Success ’ level of the FSSD . 
Expert Panel : To validate the Slow Fashion Principles , a first draft was 
distributed via email to an expert panel for feedback . The experts were 
chosen based on their professional involvement with the Slow Movement , 
Sustainable Fashion , and Sustainability in general . These professionals 
were from a wide range of disciplines and included representatives from 
Slow Lab , Slow Planet , the World Institute of Slowness , Greener2Green 
( NGO )  , the Centre for Sustainable Fashion , The Natural Step Italy , along 
with sustainable fashion designers , and sustainability practitioners ( see 
appendix A )  . Comments on the Slow Fashion Principles were received via 
email and telephone conversations over a two-week period , which were 
then synthesized into the final version presented in this thesis . 
2 . 3 . 5 Networking
Thesis blog : This acted as informal communication between our advisors , 
expert panel , co-producers , and the general public for feedback . It was an 
experimental research method to establish trust with survey participants and 
interviewees , as they had unrestricted access to our thoughts on Slow 
Fashion topics , our recent discoveries , and research progress . 
Online Networks : LinkedIn , Facebook , the Thread ’ s Gazette online 
newsletter , ecofashionworld . com , organiccotton . org , and 
ethicalfashionforum . com were used to distribute the Slow Fashion 
Principles and the industry survey . This generated dialogue and awareness 
with fashion experts , interested parties , fellow researchers , fellow students 
and co-producers that participate in these on-line communities . 
Twitter : Relevant articles , blog updates , and the survey were shared via 
Twitter to help establish a relationship with the on-line fashion community . 
Expert Review : The thesis was regularly submitted to Slow Fashion 
designers , retailers , design professionals and sustainability practitioners in 
order to receive qualitative insight and feedback that further enriched this 
thesis . Professionals working in fields outside of fashion were included 
maintain a whole system perspective ( appendix D )  .

3 Results 
The results of this research are discussed in the context of the secondary 
research questions . The results are presented under the four research 
phases , as outlined in the Methods section . 
The FSSD has provided this research with a reliable structure to assess 
whether the Slow Fashion movement is moving toward sustainability in a 
strategic manner . 
3 . 1 Phase 1 : FSSD
System Level . At this level of the FSSD , we have taken a bird ’ s eye view to 
determine the structure of the Slow Fashion system , which is identified as 
the Slow Fashion movement existing within the larger fashion industry , 
within society , within the ecosphere ( see figure 3 . 1 )  . Understanding the 
system is a key to understanding the interconnectivity of the Slow Fashion 
movement ’ s success with both society and the ecosphere . The system sets 
boundaries for success , strategic recommendations , as well as specific 
actions and tools undertaken to achieve success . The Slow Fashion system 
includes designers , brands , suppliers , buyers , manufacturers , retailers and 
co-producers , and their collective interactions . However , these players may 
not yet consider themselves part of the 
Slow Fashion movement per se and 
recognize their interconnectivity with 
others in the movement , because it is still 
considered a relatively new development 
and it is not widely known . For the 
purpose of this research , the Slow Fashion 
movement encompasses a number of 
business models and fashion industry 
terms , such as “ sustainable new ”  ,  “ ecofashion ”  ,  “ ethical ” fashion , vintage and 
second-hand , and it gathers these models 
under one movement . 
From our assessment of survey responses , most of the Slow Fashion players 
are aware of the ecological system boundaries that they operate within ( see
appendix F for the survey responses )  . Specifically , 73 % of the survey 
respondents acknowledged that they have a responsibility to practice 
Figure 3 . 1 . The system
20
environmental stewardship by incorporating life-cycle thinking or ecodesign principles when sourcing materials or designing garments . For 
example , making garments from materials that are in closed loop scenarios 
( Julia Roebuck )  ; dye processes that use no water or chemicals ( Orang 
Orang )  ; and , using long-lasting fabrics that can be reused ( Anonymous )  . 
The Slow Fashion system is comprised of fashion designers that rely on 
raw fibres , such as organic cotton and other materials that are derived from 
the natural environment . Specifically , 60% of respondents are sourcing 
sustainable materials such as organic cotton , bamboo , hemp and a variety of 
others . According to the survey results , 25 out of 33 respondents make 
material sourcing decisions based on minimizing environmental impacts . 
This suggests that there is a strong understanding of the connection between 
the designer and the impacts he or she has on the environment . 
Also , the movement recognizes its connectivity to the social system , its 
impacts on people in the supply chain and aims to make a positive 
contribution by paying living wages and supporting the communities that 
they work with . Fifteen of the survey respondents indicated that the retail 
price of their garments reflects the external social costs of producing the 
clothing by paying producers a living wage . For instance , frei designs of 
Chicago revealed that their prices reflect the higher price point of local 
production , living wage , and using organic cotton . This ensures they are 
positively supporting organic farmers / mills and local production . Three of 
the respondents also redistribute their profits into community development 
or local charities . OrangOrang donates 2 % of their profits to the Yayasan 
Kasih Peduli Anak ( YKPA ) orphanage in Bali ( OrangOrang Project 2010 )  . 
Seven survey respondents indicated that they have future plans for 
supporting communities or environmental organizations . 
Sixteen Fashion designers also indicated that their primary business 
purpose was tied to social or environmental objectives demonstrating that 
they are aware of the larger ecological and social system they operate 
within . Here are some examples : 
• To develop a sustainable lifestyle culture ( Anonymous )  ; 
• To reduce textile waste by up cycling on a large scale and 
collaborating with larger companies to reduce their environmental 
impact ( Anonymous )  ; 
• To empower women in rural villages and help keep children off the 
streets of Bali ( Orang Orang )  ; 
• Support artisans by providing them with employment ( blackfly )  . 
21
Success Level . This level guided us to inquire if the movement has a clear 
vision of where they are going that is shared or widely used . Based on the 
literature review , industry survey and interviews , it was concluded that it 
does not . Rather , the Slow Fashion movement is fragmented ; scattered 
initiatives and networks do exist throughout the movement , but they lack an 
overarching vision for the future as well as a common framework for 
addressing sustainability issues . We also considered if the movement has a 
common definition of sustainability . It was discovered in the survey that no 
two respondents provided the same definition of sustainability . However , 
fourteen respondents provided a definition of what sustainability means for 
their business and these definitions incorporated environmental and / or 
social objectives ( see figure 3 . 2 for a sampling of definitions from the 
industry survey and appendix F for the full list )  .

flexible working hours ; this creates a more quality made garment . Being 
environmentally conscious in all aspects of sourcing from fabrics to office 
supplies , etc .  ” 
Figure 3 . 2 . Sustainability Quotes ( survey results )  . 
Strategic Guidelines Level . With no shared vision of a sustainable future , 
the Slow Fashion movement is not able to ‘ backcast ’ from success ( see 
section 2 . 2 . 1 )  . Consequently , Slow Fashion players are not being strategic 
in their individual or collective actions . As well , there is no evidence that 
the movement is using a prioritized approach for determining strategic 
actions or a long-term strategy for attaining sustainability . 
Actions level . The Action level describes what can be tangibly done by one 
organization or company in a way that supports an overall strategy to attain 
success ( Robèrt , et al . 2002 )  . Businesses and individual designers are 
already undertaking numerous sustainability actions ( see section 1 . 3 )  . Here 
are some examples of individual actions from the survey results : 
• Remaking existing vintage garments into individual pieces ( Anja 
Hynynen )  ; 
22
• Promoting organic fibers and vegetable dyes locally by educating the 
suppliers ( Orang Orang )  ; 
• Offering lifetime repair or redesign assistance ( chicadecanela )  ; 
• Engaging the garment wearer in issues around sustainable fashion 
( Julia Roebuck )  ; 
• Using biodegradable packaging ( Anonymous )  ; 
• Offseting carbon emissions by purchasing offsets which get invested 
into alternative energy projects ( Anonymous )  . 
Tools level . Designers and brands are using some sustainability tools in 
their business operations . As mentioned previously , life-cycle thinking and 
eco-design is being used as a tool by a number of designers in the 
movement ( 73 % of respondents )  . As well , eight of the survey respondents 
are using textile and garment labels such as Certified Organic Cotton , Fair 
Trade , OEKO TEX STANDARD 100 , Made-By label , Organic Exchange 
and the Global Organic Textile Standard ( GOTS )  . 
However at the Actions and Tools level , it is recognized that current 
initiatives are not necessarily strategic , based on the lack of the use of the 
Success and Strategic Guidelines level . As well , theyt are not currently 
constrained by the four sustainability principles ( see section 2 . 2 . 1 )  ; 
therefore , they are not strategic in nature . 
3 . 2 Phase 2 : Leverage Points
Leverage Points have been utilized to guide our analysis through the Slow 
Fashion system and have assisted in pinpointing areas that can be addressed 
to determine if the Slow Fashion movement is being strategic . Here we 
discuss each of Donella Meadows ’ 12 Leverage Points in regards to RQ3 : 
How can Leverage Points be used to strengthen Slow Fashion ' s 
contribution to a sustainable society ? By analyzing the sub-questions : A ) 
How is each Leverage Point being used by the movement ? B ) What are the 
barriers or gaps preventing the success of each Leverage Point ? 
3 . 2 . 1 12 . Constants , parameters , and numbers 
This Leverage Point focuses on how changing parameters and numbers in 
the system by using regulations such as standards , taxes and subsidies could 
support Slow Fashion ’ s development . Although this is one of the easiest 
points of intervention , there is not much leverage in these types of standards 
to bring momentum to the Slow Fashion movement because they do not 
23
impact producer or co-producer behavior or alter the structure of the larger 
fashion system . But according to Meadows , when the standard or efficiency 
improvement fuels a balancing or reinforcing loop or feeds into a lower 
point of intervention it can have more leverage ( see Leverage Points 7 and 
8 )  ( Meadows 1991 )  . 
Efficiency standards for textile and garment manufacturing processes are 
quite widely used by the movement and not hard to achieve . As a result , 
water consumption is often being reduced and wastewater is being filtered 
from dyehouses ( Fletcher 2008 , 61 )  . One barrier to using this leverage point 
effectively is that certifications , can be costly , making it often unaccessible 
to small producers / designers in Slow Fashion ( five survey respondents 
indicated this )  . 
3 . 2 . 2 11 . Buffers : size of stabilizing stocks relative 
to their flows
Buffers have the ability to stabilize and protect a system from fluctuations , 
similar to how a lake holds water that goes in and out of it in a flow . Large 
stocks offer stability , however , the larger the stock the more difficult it is to 
change , leading to in-flexibility in the system . In this research garment 
inventories , conventional cotton and other materials are considered as 
stocks . Natural fabric dyes are also considered . We have found the 
following stabilizing stocks and flows in the Slow Fashion movement that 
are currently addressing or could be addressing sustainability initiatives .  
( Meadows 1991 )  . 
To decrease the stock of garments , many sustainable designers release only 
two collections per year or produce only to order , reducing overstock ( 60% 
of survey respondents )  . As Slow Fashion is designed to last many seasons 
( 65% of survey respondents indicate 5 years or longer )  , excess inventory 
can be sold the following season ( Hethorn 2008 , 100 )  . This reduces the 
material throughput in the system . 
More sustainable materials such as organic cotton , bamboo , hemp , and flax 
are being used to address buffers and flows of conventional cotton ( see 
appendix F Q2 )  . Each new material stock can address the size of buffers 
and flows differently . Twenty-one of the survey respondents , for example , 
are using Certified Organic Cotton . Nevertheless , organic cotton and other 
more sustainable materials are expensive on the market because of their 
scarcity so it is difficult for small brands / designer to afford them . 
24
All respondents were interested in sourcing more sustainable materials in 
the future but , apart from the cost factor , there are also other barriers that 
could take time to be overcome . For example , bamboo is a rapidly 
renewable crop and it can grow in a variety of climates and it needs less 
land to produce the same amount of , for example , cotton ( Delano 2007 )  . 
However , even this material , along with others , still has some 
environmental impacts during its processing , and this means that even if 
widely available and affordable , these materials would still not be 
completely sustainable . Some of these environmental impacts could be 
lessened if technology for processing would develop rapidly . Another 
example can be made for hemp : bans on hemp farming still limit cultivation 
in US and technology to process hemp is still under development ( Ducas 
2010 )  . Such barriers need to be overcome but often they cannot be 
addressed directly by Slow Fashion players , being the problems concerning 
the also the larger fashion industry . 
3 . 2 . 3 10 . The structure of material stocks and flows
This Leverage Point refers to the structure of the material stocks and flows 
throughout the fashion industry , such as textiles and garments – from raw 
fibers to textile processing , and material selection through to garment 
design and end-use . The material flows from co-producers back into the 
fashion system for re-use , recycling and re-design are also considered as 
part of the Slow Fashion movement . 
Seventeen survey respondents indicated that their fabric and textile 
sourcing decisions were based on it being locally accessible . Consequently , 
this may decrease the use of energy for transportation and the purchase 
supports local businesses and economic development . New supply chain 
structures have also emerged to support the model of localized production 
and globalized distribution using identical products produced within each 
territory ( i . e . Continental Clothing in the UK )  . 
Take back systems have been implemented by a few major brands ( i . e . 
Patagonia ) to achieve closed-loop garment production ( Hethorn 2008 , 121-
122 )  . But overall , brand take-back programs are in their infancy , as 93% of 
the survey respondents do not have this type of initiative in place . 
Instead of up-cycling clothing for reuse , two survey respondents 
emphasized that they wanted the co-producer to keep their garments for 
many years , instead of taking them back through this type of program . One 
brand encourages a ' share policy ’ as their garments are designed as 
25
heirloom pieces that they hope will be handed down and shared through the 
generations . 
Smaller designers are up-cycling materials by remaking garments from 
reclaimed fabrics and used clothing found in one area / country ( 3 survey 
respondents ; see figure 3 . 3 ) and then reselling them using existing retail 
structures ( Davidson 2008 )  . For example , Vancouver designer Sans Soucie
uses recycled nylon hosiery to innovate new garments . Customers are 
offered a discount on a new purchase for returning older items for redesign 
and restyling . As well , 45 % of survey respondents are restyling or codesign any garments with their customers , adding to the localized supply 
chain structure .

Sixty-four designers , artisans , and volunteers have come together in Hyde 
Park , UK to use locally-sourced recycled clothing materials to innovate new 
garments . The final product is a playful 8-piece fashion collection , under the 
label ‘ Antiform ’  , but the process generates a ripple of positive effects . 
Sewing , embroidery , and knitting skills are shared amongst the community and 
re-learned . Materials that would have ended up in landfills are reused and 
remade , and the local community and economy are supported . This project has 
taken three years to launch , but Lizzie Harrison hopes that one day the lessons 
she learned throughout the process can be shared with others and used as a 
model for sustainable , local fashion production . 
Figure 3 . 3 . Case Study : Remade in Leeds ,  ( Harrison 2010 )  . 
For the most part , changing the physical structure of material flows is 
difficult and expensive , due to the complex nature of the fashion industry ’ s 
supply chain . If new supply chain structures would be properly designed in 
the first place , it would allow for leverage in the Slow Fashion system 
( Meadows 1991 )  . 
In order to build localized supply chain structures that include fiber and 
textile production and up-cycling , a number of barriers and gaps need to be 
addressed : 
• In most cases , it is still more cost-effective to source materials from 
developing countries . Nineteen designers surveyed in the UK , 
Canada and the United States stressed that sustainable fabrics and 
textiles were not available locally and that the capacity to produce 
them was limited . When available , six survey respondents indicated 
that they are expensive and five small designers could not meet the 
minimum order ( Chenoweth 2010 ; survey results )  . 
26
• It is very challenging to establish new , localized supply chain 
structures due to the time and energy required to build relationships 
with new suppliers and the limited availability in sustainable fibre 
choices ( Kibbey 2010 )  . 
• Textile recycling “ banks ” and residential textile recycling programs 
are not widespread in most countries . Also , some implemented take 
back programs gather garments for distribution in developing 
countries such as Italian brand Elena Mirò ( Elena Mirò 2010 )  . 
• Consumers tend to donate garments that are considered “ high 
quality ”  ( a brand name ) to local charities . The rest of the unwanted 
clothing is destined to landfill ( Morgan and Birtwistle 2009 )  , downcycled to other industries such as the furniture , automotive and 
buildings or resold on the market in developing countries ( Defra 
2008 )  . 
• For take-back programs , it was also mentioned that this type of 
program may be too forward thinking for co-producers and that 
there would need to be incentives , along with , a mechanism in the 
supply chain to facilitate this ( Kibbey 2010 )  . Also , four survey 
respondents were interested in starting this type of program in the 
future , but their operations are too small and they do not have a 
facility for storage . 
3 . 2 . 4 9 . Delays
Delays in a system are typical causes of oscillations when trying to adjust 
stocks and flows to a certain goal . When trying to adjust a stock , there is a 
delay in the real information available about that stock , and it is natural to 
overshoot or undershoot a system change to make the stock reach the 
desired level ( Meadows 1991 )  . Slow Fashion is addressing this quite 
strategically as it seems to have found short-term solutions to problems that 
cannot be directly solved by them . 
One example is the scarcity in recycling mills present in most countries . 
This limits textile recycling , forcing brands to source new raw materials . 
Slow Fashion is being strategic here , as while waiting for these new 
facilities to be built , it is remaking clothing from reused materials ( see 
Leverage Point 10 )  . The brand Goodone in UK collaborates with textile 
recycling banks in the London area to rescue unwanted garments and 
remake them in new and one-of-a-kind garments while being supported by 
local authorities that see this initiative as a way to tackle waste problems 
27 
( Davidson 2008 )  . 
Another example is the delay of co-producers shifting purchases from Fast
to Slow Fashion . This delay is mainly due to lack of awareness of the 
environmental and social impacts caused by Fast Fashion , poor availability 
of Slow Fashion in retail stores , and also for the gap in price difference , as 
Fast Fashion is very inexpensive . Slow Fashion brands are strategically 
addressing this by encouraging “ reflective consumption ”  , 12 respondents 
are promoting the purchase of their high quality , functional designs and 
heirloom pieces thus adding extra value to the purchase ( see also Leverage 
Point 7 & 2 )  . 
There is also a delay for establishing natural fabric dyes due to biological 
factors , technology , and skill development . Natural dyes can be sourced 
from plants that take various amount of time to mature ( up to 20 years ) thus 
create a delay in the amount of time that natural dyes can become 
 ‘ mainstream ’  ( Kolander 2007 )  . There is a delay in natural dye technology 
available that hinders this market ’ s development . Ninety-seven per cent of 
survey respondents were interested in using natural dyes in the future . One 
designer interviewed considered them sometimes more difficult to handle , 
in terms of final product quality , than artificial dyes ( Goldsmith 2010 )  . 
Research and testing of natural dyes obtained by fruit and vegetables are 
being carried forward and promoted by the Permacouture Institute in 
California , US ( Permacouture 2010 )  . Overall , time , technology and human 
skills delays for producing and using natural dyes may represent a barrier 
for the industry . 
The above mentioned strategies already in place are contributing to achieve 
some of Slow Fashion ’ s aims , which is to slow down the pace of 
consumption of textiles and manmade materials ( i . e . dyes )  , reducing the 
amount of clothing sent to landfill and increasing environmentally friendly 
practices in the fashion industry . 
3 . 2 . 5 8 . Negative feedback loops 
Negative feedback loops are used to balance the system within safe limits 
by reducing the output of the system ( Haraldsson 2004 , 11 )  . Negative 
feedback loops need a goal , a monitoring device and a response mechanism 
to keep the system in balance . However , they are only effective if they are 
as strong as the impacts they are trying to keep in check ( Meadows 1991 )  . 
With the overall goal to reduce fashion production and consumption , Slow 
Fashion can balance larger Fast Fashion industry by decelerating 
28
consumption . Slow Fashion contributes to this purpose by enacting a 
variety of business models and educational activities that could be able to 
influence and reduce the consumptive behavior in co-producers . 
Another factor that could contribute to the reduction of garment production 
( supply ) is the introduction of regulations ( legislation , voluntary codes of 
conduct , pollution taxes ) that could lead to increased production costs for 
manufacturers thus increasing prices also for end users thus reducing the 
demand and balancing the overall system . Also , future carbon taxes and 
take-back legislations that may emerge could financially impact businesses 
that rely on shipping for all of their operations , making the Slow Fashion 
business model more desirable . 
Some barriers that limit the efficiency of the system ’ s balance : 
• Codes of conduct , such as the Ethical Trading Initiative , SA8000 
or WRAP provide standards for a living wage . However , these 
standards are still voluntary and the living wage is discretionary 
from country to country ( Allwood et al . 2006 . 2 )  . As a result , the 
price of Slow Fashion is still much higher and consumers opt to 
buy from inexpensive Fast Fashion retailers . 
• Environmental regulations are not as strict for garment producers in 
developing countries . In many cases developing countries have 
become “ pollution havens ,  ” to attract more direct foreign 
investment , that brought many corporations in the developed world 
to relocate pollution intensive production from countries with strict 
regulations to others where these are less rigid ( Clark 2000 )  . 
3 . 2 . 6 7 . Positive feedback loops
These are feedback loops within a system where actions are constantly 
reinforced . Positive loops drive the system behavior towards growth . In 
any system , there can be many of these self-reinforcing cycles . The larger 
fashion industry benefits from the presence of a negative feedback loop 
created by Slow Fashion ( see Leverage Point 8 ) that slows down the growth 
of the entire system and acts as a stabilizer . Positive feedback loops , even 
in a system that needs to grow , like Slow Fashion , must be watched because 
they can easily become unstoppable and do more harm than good . 
Slow Fashion requires more media coverage and brand marketing to help 
increase visibility , fuel awareness and demand for Slow Fashion garments . 
However , this positive feedback loop could constantly increase demand , 
and could neutralize the desired effect of slowing down total production . It 
29
is recommended that the presence of consumer awareness campaigns ( see 
appendix A ) be in place to educate co-producers about the values of 
 ‘ reflective consumption ’ to help keep Slow Fashion demand at a reasonable 
rate , rather than spiraling towards overconsumption . 
To increase consumer demand for Slow Fashion . Media coverage triggers a 
positive reinforcing loop by increasing the visibility of Slow Fashion , 
which can be further stabilized by Slow Fashion education and awareness 
campaigns . 
To increase production of Slow Fashion . An increase in demand for Slow 
Fashion from consumers , leads to an increasing the abundance of organic 
fabrics on the market , and growth of organic fibers market , which leads to 
an increased supply of Slow Fashion . 
To reinforce a community-based Slow Fashion brand . Brands provide 
guaranteed , fair , employment to communities ; leads to an increase of the 
local capacity for people to work ; leads to more skill and knowledge 
sharing and community resiliency , leads to more traditional diversity in 
product offerings , leads to more profits being redistributed back into the 
local community and an increase in the local industry , the OrangOrang 
Project in Bali , Indonesia does just this . In this case it can be challenging 
to build trust in the community and cultural differences can make meeting 
Western garment production demands difficult ( Charet and McGrew 2010 )  .  
 “ When you commit to doing a business like ours it is a necessity to emerge 
yourself with the people here . You can ’ t just be there , give training and 
support , you need to feel one with this new community of yours , in an 
anthropologist way ”  ( Catherine Charet , OrangOrang Project )  . 
3 . 2 . 7 6 . The structure of information flows
The structure of information flows can be an effective Leverage Point in the 
Fashion System , if information is delivered where it was not before , 
causing people to change behaviour . However , to trigger action it is 
necessary to couple new information with resources and incentives to 
support the behaviour change ( Meadows 2008 )  . In the fashion industry , 
adding to or changing the flows of information between companies in a 
supply chain or between retailers , designers and consumers can create large 
changes for little effort ( Fletcher 2008 , 67 )  . We will use two examples : 
1 . Flow of information within the Supply Chain . Industry supply chains are 
30
becoming more transparent and players are engaging in dialogue to tackle 
complex sustainability challenges ( Kibbey 2010 )  . Eco-labelling schemes , 
and the recent creation of online hubs , magazines , tradeshows and summits 
are also contributing to these efforts ( see appendix B )  . Dialogue between 
designers and suppliers for certification and education on organic fibres is 
also increasing . Government bodies , research centres , such as the Centre for 
Sustainable Fashion , and NGO are also releasing reports to spread 
sustainability awareness among stakeholders in the larger fashion industry 
( see appendix A )  . 
However , there is a lack of consensus within the industry on the life cycle 
impacts of most textiles ( Baldwin et al . 2009 , 33 )  . There is no widelyavailable scientific / third party study comparing fibers and processes , so it is 
not possible to say one fiber is superior to another ( Gagnon 2007 , 40 )  . 
According to the survey , only 15% of respondents use an online or 
published resource to compare the environmental impacts of material 
selections . 
For example , natural dyes are commonly perceived as inferior to synthetics , 
which causes natural dyes to be underutilized . However , if a professional 
natural dyer is knowledgeable and skillful , the quality can outlast many 
common synthetic dyes ( Kolander 2010 )  . There is currently one 
benchmark for natural dyes called Tyria . This type of certification can 
increase the use of natural dye techniques and reaffirm its quality product 
( Kolander 2007 )  . Based on interviews and survey results , this benchmark 
is not widely used and needs to be further developed . 
Also , there is no unique platform for the Slow Fashion movement to 
communicate and share information throughout the supply chain . Overall , 
only 37% of industry respondents collaborate with their suppliers on 
sustainability issues . One challenge faced in this process was revealed :  “ I 
find getting information from the mills very difficult . It may be because I 
am still a small operation .  ”  ( Green Bean Baby )  . 
As well , current garment labelling schemes ( i . e . Fair Trade , GOTS etc ) can 
be costly and time intensive for gaining certification thus small brands are 
unable access them . Three respondents indicated that they were too 
expensive to gain certification . Also , eco-labels can be better marketed , so 
that people know what the certification means ( Flora and Fauna )  . One 
respondent mentioned :  “ We could probably qualify for some of eco-labels
31
but haven ' t applied as they don ' t seem that relevant . We know everything 
we do is eco and ethical ”  ( Anonymous )  . 
In terms of education for the future generation of designers , courses on 
sustainable fashion are scarce in general , although many universities in UK 
have recently launched new specific programs around this topic ( Baldwin 
2008 )  . 
2 . Flow of information to co-producers . There has been an increase in 
public awareness campaigns , resources , tradeshows open to the public and 
designer awards for sustainable fashion . However , the awareness 
campaigns and initiatives are occurring only in a few countries and there is 
insufficient media coverage on the benefits of Slow Fashion . Also , there are 
over 70 private labels used for ecological textile and garment production 
causing inconsistency and confusion for co-producers and within the 
industry ( Staemanns 2009 )  ( see appendix E )  . As well , an increase in 
sustainability information provided at point of sale could be encouraged 
and ‘ choice architecture ’ needs to be further developed and studied 
( Soderquist 2010 )  . 
Overall , 88% of industry respondents communicate sustainability 
information to co-producers through dialogue , company websites and 
garment labels . When communicating sustainability information to coproducers , the survey respondents indicated a number of challenges : 
• People ’ s lack of understanding regarding the general environmental
impact of the fashion industry ; 
• People don ' t feel it has anything to do with them / they can ' t 
change / they don ' t have enough money / don ' t want to be seen in the 
 ' same ' clothes all the time / they follow ' fashion ' and want a different 
look every week to keep up with trends ; 
• Communicating is either made too easy with marketing " green wash " 
or too complicated with metrics and technical terms that the average 
consumer doesn ' t understand . The trick is finding a balance ; 
• I believe many consumers do not think about the origins of the 
products they consumer , I feel like we have lost touch with the 
process of creation , it is an important yet difficult task to try and 
educate people without being preachy or judgmental ; 
• Discussing the true price . 
As well , the survey respondents provided insight into their successes : 
32
• People are usually inspired to make a difference after our 
conversation ; 
• Showing people how to work with clothes is a great way to encourage 
them not to throw them away ; 
• It ' s vital to make it totally clear what the clothes are made from and 
how , having it on the garment labels is probably the most successful ; 
• We have been successful in encouraging and increasing awareness on 
sustainability as customers have purchased items from our ethical 
labels . 
3 . 2 . 8 5 . Rules : punishments , constraints , incentives
Rules of a system define its scope , boundaries and degrees of freedom . By 
changing these rules , the playing field that the system must act within can 
change . Some rules of the fashion system , such as regulatory punishments 
and incentives , are in favor of Slow Fashion . For example , the EU initiated 
a program in the 1990s that provides hemp farmers with subsidies to 
encourage hemp fiber production ( Karus 2005 )  . Also , government 
legislation has been enacted to extend the producer responsibility for 
environmental impacts . For example , the EU REACH legislation , regulates 
chemical use in the supply chain , which slightly levels the rules of the 
playing field for Slow Fashion producers ( Fletcher 2008 , 45 )  . Forty-seven 
per cent of survey respondents indicated that their business or their 
suppliers are impacted by environmental or social regulations . For example : 
• If we can meet standards and regulations they will benefit us and 
qualify us as an ethical business with publicity opportunities ; 
• More regulation and talk about the environment is good for our 
business . But the regulations are more like recommendations and are 
not enforced ; 
• There are no restrictions in Indonesia . This impacts us negatively 
because people locally and internationally neither expect nor demand 
the regulations ; 
• Impacted by tighter EPA restrictions because we use domestic 
companies . 
As well , 53% of respondents will be impacted by future regulations ( for 
example EU REACH , extended producer responsibility regulations , carbon 
taxes , environmental regulations )  . For example survey respondents 
revealed : 
• Increased cost of production and sourcing ; 
33
• Hopefully carbon taxes will give us an advantage , as we are now so 
low on carbon usage throughout our production ; 
• I assume carbon tax will affect ocean-shipping costs ; more regulation 
in China will make prices rise too , even in good factories ; 
• If future regulations cost money , we might not survive , as we are a 
small business on a tight budget . 
Overall , many ‘ rules ’ in the fashion system are still hindering the 
development of Slow Fashion . These are : 
Punishments . Overall , there are not enough punishments to limit pollution 
in the fashion supply chain . Effluents such as bleach water from dying 
cotton t-shirts , or chromium and other heavy metals from leather tanneries , 
are released in wastewater streams ( Richards et al . 2007 )  . In Slow Fashion , 
organic t-shirt printers , cellulosic manufacturers , and organic leather 
manufacturers , for example , ensure that clean water is discharged from 
their facilities . It is indicated that this takes time and money making it 
difficult for some companies to follow suit ( Fox 2007 )  . As it currently 
exists , Slow Fashion companies voluntarily internalize these externalities 
because it is the just thing to do . If all companies were required to do this 
with their environmental impacts many companies would change 
procedures drastically , giving the Slow Fashion movement a competitive 
advantage because they are already abiding by stricter standards . 
Social and environmental regulations : Many multinational companies 
operate overseas due to inexpensive labor and relaxed environmental 
regulations . For example , DDT is still used in India to produce cotton and 
this impacts global estuaries and human health . Sally Fox of Vreseis , an 
organic cotton supplier , writes " If ( US ) laws required any imported textile 
to be grown and processed under US Textile Standards we would see 
immediate improvement "  ( Fox 2007 )  . Legislation and regulations can act 
as a constraint , by removing incentives for overseas production . Moreover , 
environmental standards will improve environmental conditions in 
developing nations and provide a competitive advantage for Slow Fashion 
producers that already go above and beyond regulatory requirements . 
Labelling schemes : Textile and garment labelling also provides a constraint 
for the industry by enforcing the use of some terms such as ‘ organic ’  , 
however many industry buzzwords do not require certification (  ' ethical , 
eco , natural , sustainable '  )  ( Gagnon 2007 )  . Also , one survey respondent 
indicated that labelling can often be mandated to the point of trivial 
34
information at the cost of the business . Some labelling incentives work 
against Slow Fashion . In the case of bamboo , this can be either chemically 
or mechanically manipulated to extract the fiber . Chemical manipulation 
has many environmental impacts while mechanical manipulation is energy 
intensive and costs 5 times more , but is considered to be the more 
environmentally sound option . Both of these processes cause bamboo to be 
labeled ' man-made ' and there is currently no organic labelling protocol 
specific to educate the industry and co-producers on bamboo ' s situation that 
would allow them to choose the more environmentally friendly 
process ( this also feeds into Leverage Point 6 , Flow of Information )  . 
Bank loans : Rainfed cotton farmers have no legislative nets to be assured 
by if they have a dry season ; growing rainfed organic cotton is seen as risky 
and these farmers get high interest rates on their loans , in effect they are 
being penalized for acting sustainably ( Fox 2007 )  . Most banks view 
conventional cotton farming as a secure form of raising a cotton crop . This 
is because their use of pesticides , herbicides and fertilizers typically secures 
a return on cotton crops year after year . However due to effects they have 
on soil degradation this will most likely not be the case going forward ( Fox 
2007 )  . 
Conventional Cotton Subsidies With the goal to create an equitable cotton 
market , nations like China and US have signed the Millennium Declaration 
( 2000 ) and pledged to increase subsidies to growers in developing countries 
( Herfkens 2010 )  . With the Millennium Declaration , subsidies for cotton 
have been increased in African countries , but they have not been reduced in 
other developed countries , leading to an excess of production on the 
market , and the fall of the price of cotton . To keep up with production , 
African countries have been forced to use unsustainable practices on their 
cotton plantations . The difficulty in selling even conventional cotton due to 
such high competition and low prices , results in a lower demand and slow 
increase in organic cotton production ( Amponsah 2005 )  . 
3 . 2 . 9 4 . The power to change or self-organize 
system structure
Self-organization or evolution in any system is a strong form of resilience . 
It involves changing other aspects of the system completely , such as new 
material structures , feedback loops and rules ( Meadows 2008 )  . Selforganization occurs internally through cooperation of all of system parts , 
for the greater functioning of the whole and it requires a diversity of 
35
knowledge and choice . In the fashion industry , it involves “ generating the 
biggest stock possible of sustainability related ideas , materials , behaviors 
and culture from which to seed the building of new , or more effective , 
versions of existing systems .  ”  ( Fletcher 2008 , 71 )  . 
In the Fast Fashion industry , players ’ work with standardized business 
models based on only a few abundant materials , centralized production and 
globalized distribution . This structure does not make Fast Fashion very 
suited for change because as discussed in other Leverage Points often the 
most established physical structure and the rules of the system are hard to 
modify . Instead , the Slow Fashion movement relies on a diversity of 
business models , and , as a result , it can become very resilient . For example : 
• The idea of sustainable fashion is not new to the fashion industry . 
Only recently though , the movement is starting to self-organize and 
emerge from forward-thinking , innovative designers and brands , 
becoming more visible ( see appendix C ) especially in those 
countries where governments seem to take the sustainability 
challenge into greater consideration and spread awareness through
co-producers accordingly ( i . e . UK , Canada , Scandinavian 
countries )  ; 
• The Slow approach and Slow Movements in general are already 
trying to give rise to a vision of a “ multi-local society ” and a 
distributed economy ( Slow + Design 2006 )  ; 
• Countries where sustainable fashion is more common are 
developing online networks that aim to put the movement ’ s players 
in contact mainly on a national level ( see appendix B )  ; 
• Recently formed research centres , universities and ethical entities 
are organizing regular events , such as meetings , workshops ( Social 
Alterations 2010 ) summits , improving relationships in the supply 
chain and transparency with the co-producers ( i . e . Centre for 
Sustainable Fashion and Fashioning an Ethical Industry in UK , 
MADE By , Green2Greener in Hong Kong and Social Alterations
in the US )  . 
There are also barriers and gaps preventing the self- organization of the 
Slow Fashion movement : 
• The phenomenon of Slow Fashion is still circumscribed to the 
above-mentioned countries . Online networks / events ( see appendix 
B ) do not include all the relevant players in the supply chain , 
involving mainly academic researchers , designers and NGOs but 
fail to involve other players such as farmers and dyers . Still it can be 
36
seen as a step in the right direction . 
3 . 2 . 10 3 . System goals
Defining or changing the overarching goals of the system , ultimately 
changes how the system makes decisions , acts and organizes itself . In fact , 
the goal sets the direction of the system , defining discrepancies that need 
action and indicating if the system is behaving in compliance or if it is 
failing the goals ( Meadows 2008 )  . 
Overall , the goal of Slow Fashion is to meet fundamental human needs ( see 
section 1 . 1 . 2 ) through fashion while lessening its impact on the 
environment . In contrast , the goal of Fast Fashion is to maximize profits . 
According to the survey ’ s results , Slow Fashion brands have a wide variety 
of business goals , that involve directly or indirectly the desire to achieve 
either ecological or social sustainability or both ( see responses in appendix 
F )  . Profit is also a goal that been mentioned by a survey respondent to 
guarantee the survival of the individual businesses within the movement . 
This is exemplary of the diversity of goals within the Slow Fashion 
movement that are creative , unique and together they address an expansive 
area of needs that will help the movement move towards sustainability . 
This also leads to a more resilient movement , by having many groups 
working toward the same end : sustainability , from a multitude of angles . 
However , as per the result of RQ1 , the Slow Fashion movement does not 
have a shared definition of sustainability or shared vision of future success 
for the movement that can be interpreted as the goal or purpose of the 
system . Until the movement increases its interconnectivity it will be 
difficult to develop a shared vision . 
3 . 2 . 11 2 . The mindset the system arises from 
Society ’ s mindset is a deeper set of believes , deeply rooted in people , about 
how the world works ( Meadows 2001 )  . If the underlying values of Slow 
Fashion become the mindset of the system , then the system could arise or 
comply with the mindset . The mindset of an individual – a co-producer , a 
fashion producer , a designer - could change very rapidly , but changing the 
mindset of society at large is quite difficult and time consuming . 
In 2000 , Serbin noticed that people began to recognize hemp not as 
marijuana but as another textile fibre . This change in perception made a 
37
huge difference in his business as a hemp trader . In 2006 , hemp became 
 ' popular ' because its benefits became more widespread thus more accepted 
by the larger fashion community . He notices this change in perception as a 
huge shift for the industry in pursuing sustainability ( Serbin 2007 , 51 )  . The 
Uniform Project is another example of creating a shift in the mindset of 
the system . Here , the founder uses her creativity to demonstrate to society 
that people could ideally survive with only four dresses in the wardrobe 
( The Uniform Project 2010 )  . 
Slow fashion acts to establish a new mindset by shifting co-producers 
attitude from being a passive consumer in society to playing an active , 
participatory role in the fashion production process as a co-producer . Here , 
the human experience is heightened by being more engaged in the creative 
process by co-creating with designers or by finding innovative ways to 
consume fashion . The Slow Fashion mindset is based on “ reflective 
consumption ”  , while the Fast Fashion mindset is based on consumerism . 
In western society especially , success is linked to the level of ownership 
and status achieved in a lifetime . Consuming and owning fashion goods 
that act as a status symbol , is one of the ‘ rules ’ to be considered successful 
and it is essentially an act of passive consumption that does not satisfy 
human needs . These established mental models within society are difficult 
to alter and this acts as a barrier to shifting towards the Slow Fashion 
mindset . 
3 . 2 . 12 1 . Transcending paradigms 
A paradigm is a set of assumptions , concepts , values or practices that make 
up a way of viewing reality for a specific community that shares them . In 
all cases , this Leverage Point is the highest , as it means that no one is 
unattached to a paradigm , as there are no true paradigms consistent from 
community to community . If no paradigm is precisely accurate , then you 
can choose whichever one will help to achieve your purpose , or choose 
none at all and stay unattached to constantly develop . 
38
3 . 3 Phase 3 : Strategic recommendations
Based on the above findings , a number of short , medium and long-term2
strategic recommendations have been generated to strengthen the Slow 
Fashion movement and to move it towards sustainability ( see table 3 . 1 )  . 
Each recommendation is targeted at a specific group of Slow Fashion 
players and taps into one or more Leverage Points . Of these , three key 
recommendations have been identified as bringing the most leverage the 
Slow Fashion movement : 1 ) Co-create a vision of success using Slow 
Fashion Principles 2 ) Establish an overarching Slow Fashion network 3 ) 
Harmonize global labelling initiatives under a Slow Fashion label . These 
three recommendations also demonstrate how the three Prioritization 
Questions can be used in practice for strategic planning ( see section 3 . 3 . 4 )  .

Table 3 . 1 . Recommendations . 
41
3 . 3 . 1 Recommendation 1 : Co-create Slow Fashion 
Principles
Slow Fashion Principles should be co-created from within the movement to 
provide inspiration and guidance to individual players . In order to become 
the predominant fashion model in a sustainable society , the movement can 
co-create Slow Fashion Principles to establish a shared mental model that 
represents collective goals and aspirations , and to provide a focal point for 
self-organization ( Leverage Points 3 & 4 )  . 
Is it a step in the right direction ? Yes . Slow Fashion Principles can 
represent shared values and a vision of success , provide guidance and form 
the basis for future actions . It will be understood that a ‘ sustainable 
society ’ is defined by the four Sustainability Principles ( see section 4 . 3 )  . 
Is it a flexible platform ? Yes . A shared mental model will create a common 
language for a strategic dialogue to take place . By co-creating the 
principles , they are meant to evolve over time with more participation and 
input . Individual designers / brands can further customize the Slow Fashion 
Principles for their business . 
Will it provide adequate ROI ? 3 Yes . This can help the Slow Fashion 
movement be strategic in their actions , resulting in collective action and 
internal support , which will lead to more co-producers , a return on financial 
investment , and cost savings . By contributing to a sustainable society , the 
movement will also be encouraging a return on ecological investment by 
investing in and preserving natural capital such as water resources , 
agricultural land , and air . 
3 . 3 . 2 Recommendation 2 : Slow Fashion Network
This recommendation is intended for any player in the Slow Fashion 
movement that wishes to facilitate the growth of the movement . It is based 
on the analysis of the opportunities raised by Leverage Point 4 and 
Leverage Point 6 , relative to the Flow of Information , in this case , within 
the supply chain .  

3 Return on investment can be financial , political , social or environmental . 
42
Focus on local relationships and global interconnectedness . To encourage 
the development of collaboration , and to spur the mobilization between the 
players of the existing Slow Fashion supply chain , the authors propose the 
creation of a unique , global organization under the name of Slow Fashion , 
whose term includes “ eco ’  ,  “ sustainable ”  ,  “ green ”  , and “ ethical ” fashion . 
The organization should act as an overarching global hub and it is 
encouraged to have the following functions : 
• Represent the Slow Fashion movement worldwide ; 
• Educate and promote the Slow Fashion Principles ; 
• Create and manage a global online platform gathering all local 
chapters in the Slow Fashion movement , encouraging collaboration 
and transparency ; 
• Offer scientific information of best and most up-to-date sustainable 
practices in textile and garment production , in collaboration with 
well-established third party entities , universities and research 
centres . 
• Organize annual events to encourage and consolidate personal 
relationships between the members of the organization and the 
general public ; 
• Promote Slow Fashion and ‘ reflective consumption ’ by different 
media to reinforce visibility and values ; 
• Promote a Slow Fashion label ( see section 3 . 3 . 3 )  ; and , 
• Create opportunities for members to meet locally and increase their 
collaboration . 
Is it a step in the right direction ? Yes . It works to build a stronger industry , 
facilitating collaboration , the sharing of information , transparency and 
improving producer relationships with regards to sustainability . 
Is it a flexible platform ? Yes . Becoming recognized worldwide , the Slow 
Fashion movement can increase visibility , spread the idea of sustainable 
development and the values of Slow Fashion within the larger fashion 
industry , thus influencing more people . This will result in an increased 
demand of Slow Fashion , leading to growth . Decentralized local hubs are a 
key aspect to ensure future flexibility as the movement grows . 
Will it provide adequate ROI ? Yes . Start-ups and small brands will be able 
to benefit from the visibility that the whole organization has on a global and 
local level . This includes having access to educational , research & 
consultancy services as well as media coverage , enhancing the 
43
marketability of the whole industry . 
3 . 3 . 3 Recommendation 3 : Slow Fashion label
A garment-labelling scheme , unique to Slow Fashion should be developed 
to distinguish this movement within the larger fashion market and to add 
credibility to the movement . This labelling scheme would build off and 
incorporate current fibre and production process standards , such as organic 
cotton , Fair Trade and the Global Organic Textile Standard ( GOTS )  . The 
Slow Fashion label would be certified by an independent third-party , would 
be globally accessible , and easily recognized by co-producers . Moreover , it 
would need to be financially affordable for small brands and designers ( i . e . 
fee structure would reflect company profits / market share )  . According to the 
survey , 98 % of respondents would support this type of initiative . 
Is it a step in the right direction ? Yes , this recommendation would build off 
of the previous two , as it would unify Slow Fashion under consistent 
standards and language . The label would gather together producers with 
shared values and a common vision of sustainability , thus further 
organizing and strengthening the movement . It would also create positive 
awareness with co-producers and increase global recognition and exposure , 
supporting further development . 
Is it a flexible platform ? Yes . It would begin to provide a common 
understanding of what ‘ Slow Fashion ’ consists of . One label , which adheres 
to the most up-to-date environmental and social standards along with the 
most relevant practices within the movement , will also evolve over time . 
Environmental and social standards and voluntary codes of conduct will 
change and adapt in the future , as more up to date scientific and social data 
is made available . The label would reflect these changes , and would also 
change over time . 
Will it provide adequate ROI ? Yes , it would increase visibility of smaller 
brands and designers that would be part of a network and could use shared 
communication channels , cutting down individual advertising costs . It 
would lead to a greater co-producer awareness of the industry and allow for 
a starting point to build more trusting and long-lasting relationships with 
co-producers . By identifying the label with a credible and globally 
recognized organization , co-producers will trust the label and will want to 
support designers and brands through purchases . Overall , it will help to 
secure profits to sustain Slow Fashion businesses over time .

3 . 4 Phase 4 : Slow Fashion Principles
Based on recommendation 1 and the importance of a vision , the authors 
undertook research to discover and draft principles for the Slow Fashion 
movement ( see section 3 . 3 . 1 )  . These encompass the concepts of “ Slow ” 
and “ Sustainability ” in the context of fashion . They were uncovered 
through the literature review , survey and interviews . The authors felt 
strongly about what they discovered about the core purpose of the 
movement , so the findings were synthesized to form a first draft of ‘ Slow 
Fashion Principles ’  . These principles are not meant to be a prescriptive 
solution but to encourage Slow Fashion player ’ s creativity and adaptation 
of them for their needs . The Principles are interconnected , work in unison 
and are meant to inspire and inform the movement towards a common 
purpose of ‘ contributing to a sustainable society ’  . 
1 . Seeing the big picture Slow Fashion players recognize that they are all 
interconnected to the larger environmental and social system and make 
decisions accordingly . Slow Fashion encourages a systems thinking 
approach because it recognizes that the impacts of our collective choices 
can affect the environment and people . This response from our survey is 
typical of how the Slow Fashion mindset supports a Systems Thinking 
approach ,  “ The money the garments make goes directly back into 
supporting the organic farmers / mills / local production- it is an ecosystem 
that supports ethical production from start to finish .  ” See section 3 . 1 for 
more examples of how Slow Fashion recognizes it ’ s interconnected to the 
larger system . 
2 . Slowing down consumption to allow earth ’ s natural regeneration . Kate 
Fletcher ’ s 2008 book , Design Journeys , describes how slowing down the 
use of raw materials by slowing down fashion production could allow the 
earth ’ s regenerative capabilities to take place . This will alleviate pressure 
on the earth ’ s natural production cycles so the Slow Fashion movement can 
be in a healthy rhythm with what the earth can naturally provide . As 
discovered in the survey , Slow Fashion players agree with Fletcher ’ s works 
and already address issues surrounding consumption :  “ I have been 
producing ‘ slow ’ clothes since the late nineties and I am not about to 
change that . I am passionate about making a change in our consumption 
habits and educating the public forum… ” Also , Make Do and Mend is a 
movement that promotes making do with what you have rather than buying 
new to combat unnecessary overconsumption ( MakeDoMend 2010 )  . 
45
Slow Lab , a prominent Slow movement organization , writes about how 
slowing the pace can foster reflective consumption , which could also result 
in decelerating global consumption ( Fuad-Luke 2010 )  . Slow Food has 
parallel goals , as it strives for organic and local production that celebrates 
what the land can provide rather than mass-produced foodstuffs we attempt 
to squeeze out of it ( Slow Food International 2010 )  . 
3 . Diversity - Strength , resilience and beauty lie in diversity . Biodiversity : 
Preserving and supporting the variety of life and of habitats on Earth is vital 
to human welfare , and its loss can lead to important economic , 
environmental and social consequences ( OECD 2005 )  . The earth , over 
millions of years , has given humankind abundance and diversity . Slow 
Fashion encourages the recognition of this abundance on earth that is a 
strong and resilient system offering solutions to the threats of climate 
change . Rain-fed cotton can help our water consumption exist within the 
earth ’ s hydration cycles . Recycled fabrics can decelerate the consumption 
of raw materials provided by the earth . Hemp and bamboo can help limit 
natural resource consumption by producing more per SF , being less 
resource intensive and improving soil quality ( Fletcher 2008 , 25 )  . 
Business diversity : Slow Fashion wants “ not one answer , but a mass of 
answers ” to join together in answering the call for sustainability ; secondhand , vintage , recycled , fashion leasing , independent designers , larger 
fashion houses and even your local knitting club , clothing swaps and 
swishing etc . are all recognized as models that contribute to the Slow 
Fashion movement ( Fletcher 2008 )  . Everyone in the movement is in this 
together and discovering creative new solutions is encouraged . 
Cultural diversity : Slow Fashion encourages traditional methods of garment 
making , textile making and dyeing techniques . Keeping these methods 
alive gives creativity , vibrancy and meaning to what we wear , why we wear 
it , and how it was made . There is extensive knowledge throughout regions 
of the world on best utilization of local resources ; this can be used today to 
address climate change concerns . Similarly , family traditions are important , 
as it encourages heirlooms and hand-me-downs pieces that span the 
generations and offer rewarding emotional experiences ( Self Passage 2010 )  . 
4 . Respecting People – Treating others as they would like to be treated . 
Slow Fashion players ’ worldwide support and participate in campaigns that 
help to educate and inspire the fair treatment of people across borders . The 
Asian Floor Wage Alliance seeks fair compensation for all workers . From 
46
the survey results : 3 support the Ethical Trading Initiative , 2 support the 
Fair Wear Foundation , 2 support the Fair Labour Association , and 2 
support the Business Social Compliance Initiative . Many independent 
designers work with local communities to help the community become 
more resilient by giving them the learning curve to help them trade such as 
OrangOrang project , Toms Shoe , and Banuk . 
5 . Acknowledging human needs through co-creation . Slow Fashion 
encourages people to meet fundamental human needs by 
offering fashion with emotional significance . Human needs that can be met 
by fashion are creativity , identity , understanding and participation ( see 
section 1 . 1 . 2 )  . 
Fashion allows people to communicate a message to the world , to be 
perceived in a certain way , to feel part of a social group and at the same 
time to be original , creative and free ( Self Passage 2010 )  . The Slow 
Fashion designer has the opportunity to create relationships with coproducers , telling the story behind a garment and inviting the customer to 
be part of the creative process . In this process , the co-producer and the 
designer lend each other help in satisfying their fundamental needs for 
participation and creativity ( Self Passage 2010 )  . 
From our survey results , we have identified many Slow Fashion designers 
that co-create garments with their co-producers , in hopes to create longlasting and personal garments . Here is a sampling of quotes .  
 “ Most garments are a collaboration between me and the client .  ”  
 “ I ' ve had customers with old clothes that want re vamping , and we work 
together on the style and look they want to achieve . I ' ve also made items 
from the collection out of their own donated items too .  ”  
 “ We work with individuals to restyle their clothing to a specific theme . If 
they are willing to engage with the manufacture process then this can also 
be used , but normally they are happy to hand it over , give a specification 
and get back an altered garment .  ” 
6 . Building relationships to collaborate and co-create . Trusting and 
lasting relationships create a stronger movement . 
In the supply chain : the OrangOrang project is an excellent example of a 
Slow Fashion business that builds strong relationships with a local 
community , while they are founded in Canada they work in Bali , Indonesia . 
47
Here they work with the local community to re-learn traditional 
craftsmanship and natural dyes . When they make new relationships they 
make long-term commitments , and they also provide fair wages and 
training to workers . This happens through building trust with the 
community through dialogue and communication ( Charet and McGrew 
2010 )  . The creation of new relationships leads to the possibility of finding 
more strategic solutions to shared problems ( Slow + Design 2006 )  . 
Laura Chenoweth , a Canadian Slow Fashion designer has built a trusting 
relationship with her organic cotton supplier in India and has ensured a 
long-term commitment , in order to secure good pricing and consistent 
fabric supply . She also promotes her supplier by word-of-mouth to nurture 
this relationship ( Chenoweth 2010 )  . 
Between producers and co-producers : As seen in Principle 5 , many Slow 
Fashion designers co-create garments or educate co-producers about their 
businesses ( such as what standards they follow and where materials come 
from )  , which creates trust within those relationships . 
7 . Resourcefulness – Relying on local resources and skills . Many Slow 
Fashion designers focus on using locally abundant materials when possible 
and try to support the development of local businesses and skills . 
Local Labour : frei designs uses local labour found in her Chicago area to 
create her clothing lines . Burdastyle gives a new meaning to ‘ local labour ’ 
by sharing clothing patterns online you download and make at home . 
Local Knowledge : Clothing swaps and knitting parties are happening all 
over the world , where neighbours encourage , develop and trade traditional 
skills . The 4H club in the United States , along with Home Economics 
courses teaches younger generations sewing and repair skills ( 4H 2010 )  . 
This simple understanding of how a garment is made creates awareness in 
regards to the time spent in making it and the ability needed in doing so . 
These two factors alone could represent a valid justification in the eyes of 
the customer for the premium price of the garment and an early start to 
valuing quality and craftsmanship . Make Do Mend supports human capital 
by encouraging skills development and educating co-producers to remake , 
repair and restyle garments so they will last longer . 
Local Materials : Local materials is something the movement is interested 
in , but due to the fact that many designers practice in urban areas and far 
from where fibres grow , Slow Fashion players try to make the best 
48
decisions when sourcing materials . Although , some groups do work with 
communities where fibre ’ s for fashion items are grown and work to support 
these local communities and help them grow , for example Fair Trade 
organic cotton , and Slow Fashion designers would purchase this type of 
materials . Pact , an underwear brand , ensures that the organic cotton crop , 
its processing , spinning , knitting , weaving , dying , printing and sewing 
happen within the same 100 mile radius in Turkey , although it is sold 
online worldwide ( Pact 2010 )  . 
Some schemes have emerged that are at the true essence of 
 ‘ resourcefulness ’  . The Sew–Op is a non-profit organization that teaches 
local communities ( in the developed world ) how to be sustainable by using
the resources available . Sweat Shop is a café in Paris with sewing 
machines for rent , making repairing a seam easy . And Remade in Leeds
teaches locals sewing skills by making new clothes from castoffs . 
8 . Maintaining quality and beauty – Quality leads to longevity . 
Encouraging classic design over today ’ s trends will contribute to the 
longevity of garments , thus contributing to a sustainable society through 
decelerating consumption ( Fletcher 2008 )  . Through our survey we have 
found that Slow Fashion designers are ensuring the longevity of the 
clothing they produce :  
 “ We strive for longevity by making the design of dresses quite classical . 
The fabrics we source and quality of stitching are the best we can access 
locally .  ”  
 “ Not so trend oriented but more classic period pieces , big statement pieces 
that are timeless and well made and durable .  
 “ Well made garments with good quality natural materials and traditional 
cuts .  .  . something that you can wear now and in 10 years time .  ” 
9 . Profitability – Contributing to the economic strength of the industry . 
Slow Fashion producers need to make profits , and increase their visibility 
in the market to stay in the game and be competitive . Slow Fashion prices 
are often higher due to the incorporation of sustainable natural resources , 
safe working conditions and fair wages . Slow Fashion acts as a steward by 
keepings its prices fair and reflecting the true materials and craftsmanship 
in each garment . We can see this type of thinking through responses 
gathered in our industry survey :  
 “ Everything is made by me to keep cost down because you can ' t change the 
49
world if it ' s not accessible .  ”  
 “ The cost of the garments reflect the higher prices of local production 
( living wages ) and the higher price point of purchasing organic cotton… ” 
Through our conversations and interviews , we recognize that price can 
undermine the competitiveness of this movement and it is a true concern . 
10 . Practicing Consciousness – Giving your heart and brain a chance . 
Slow Fashion players make many decisions based on their personal 
passions , an awareness of their connection to others and the environment 
and their responsibility and willingness to act accordingly . It has been 
discovered that they genuinely care about satisfying human needs rather 
than simply the bottom line . Within the Slow Fashion movement , many 
people love what they do , and have a desire to make a difference in the 
world in a creative and innovative way . Generally , well-informed 
decisions , based on quality information , are made to ensure sustainability is 
considered and integrated . Throughout the research process , we have 
uncovered many thoughtful people and brands working towards a 
sustainable fashion industry and we wanted to applaud their efforts . 
50
4 Discussion 
Here we discuss the results of our research to answer our main question : 
How can a Strategic Sustainable Development approach be used to bring 
momentum to the Slow Fashion movement and ensure that it is moving 
towards sustainability ? 
As researchers , we wanted to come into the process acknowledging the 
progress the fashion industry has already made to move towards 
sustainability . Therefore , we decided to strengthen the Slow Fashion 
movement ’ s existing endeavours and strategically empower its players 
rather than try to completely change the larger fashion industry as a whole , 
which is operating under business as usual . 
We have started this research from the assumption that the Slow Fashion 
movement is not collectively recognized as such , either by the fashion 
industry or by society at large . Rather , it has begun to operate as a 
grassroots movement and is identifiable on a small scale with local 
designers and retailers . As the Slow Fashion movement does not yet 
officially exist as such , it has great potential for future development . 
4 . 1 The goal of the Slow Fashion system
From the literature review and survey , we deduced that through the many 
ideals of Slow Fashion , its overarching goal is to contribute to a 
sustainable society ; this is the unstated commonality that holds Slow 
Fashion together . Goals are the driving force of a system , responsible for 
inspiring , setting the direction , indicating compliance , and failure or 
success to the members that share a common understanding of it . This goal 
has the capacity to bind the people within the movement together by their 
common aspirations , providing focus and energy for continual learning 
( Senge 1990 )  . Slow Fashion , if strengthened , will function as a balancing 
system , to slow down the effects of overconsumption thus contributing to 
the making of a more sustainable society . As the goal of the system 
determines the behaviour of all of its parts , there is a need to communicate 
and share a whole-system purpose throughout the system so that every 
action will work in concert towards the common goal ( Meadows 2008 , 
141 )  . 
51
This goal is also very general , allowing people to meet it in a variety of 
ways and creative approaches . It is equally important for this unique and 
innovative movement to have a shared goal where individuals can still 
keep their own personal purposes and business goals as they can only 
add vitality to the shared vision ( Senge 1990 )  . Whether individuals in the 
movement are looking to ‘ empower women in developing countries ’  ,  ‘ to 
reduce textile waste ’  ,  ‘ to make corporate social responsibility sexy ’ or to 
 ‘ spread awareness about ethical fashion ’  ( from survey results )  , they can still 
keep these goals that are true to their business , as these are all ways in 
which they can contribute to the shaping of a sustainable society . One of 
the greatest strengths of the Slow Fashion movement lies in the diversity of 
business size and models that needs to be enhanced if society wants to 
address environmental and social problems in a creative way . 
4 . 2 Co-creating a vision
The Slow Fashion Principles that were unearthed during this research could 
be used to encourage all levels of the supply chain – from individual 
designers , through to retailers and co-producers to make a positive 
contribution to a sustainable society . Slow Fashion Principles , similarly to 
Slow Food , Slow Design , and Permaculture principles , can represent a set 
of shared values amongst the movement . Ultimately , the Slow Fashion 
Principles would spark a dialogue around sustainability issues and will 
establish a collective purpose for the movement centred on satisfying 
fundamental human needs ( see section 1 . 1 . 2 ) through fashion design , 
creation and use . 
Through the FSSD assessment , it was determined that the movement lacks 
a common vision of success , which is essential for strategic planning in 
complex systems ( see section 3 . 1 )  . While this process needs to be initiated , 
ultimately a successful future vision needs to emerge internally from the 
movement and co-created amongst movement members in order for it to be 
effective . 
As the Slow Fashion movement has not established a central network yet , 
and due to the short time frame for our research , this thesis did not have the 
opportunity to co-create a shared vision with the movement . Instead , values 
were discovered throughout the research period and these were discussed 
with an expert panel to further tap into the mental model of the movement 
rather than imposing new ideals . It is recognized that the principles will be 
52
further developed and will need to be widely distributed amongst Slow 
Fashion designers , suppliers and retailers for them to be co-created . 
During the co-creation process , Slow Fashion players will deepen their 
understanding of the definition of sustainability and their interconnections 
with others in the movement - supporting the System and Success level of 
the FSSD . The Slow Fashion Principles can be continually co-developed 
within the movement to create general acceptance and build enthusiasm 
around them . A common vision for the future is only strategic and valid if 
the entire community accepts it . Slow Fashion players ’ acceptance would 
lead to reinforcing the vision through creating clarity , commitment and 
creative tension around it . 
Spreading a vision to create a shared meaning and purpose is the first 
strategic step for Slow Fashion to begin moving toward sustainability . 
Shared visions have a way of spreading through personal contact , linking 
communities together . While the Slow Fashion Principles could be shared 
on-line encouraging participation , it would be best for them to be discussed 
at informal fashion community events and gatherings , fostering sharing and 
dialogue around them . This setting allows people to get to the heart of their 
own purpose and establish a further connection to the larger movement , 
encouraging their peers along with them . 
Visions can also fade if people become discouraged by the difficulties of 
bringing the vision into reality . This can also happen if people forget how 
they are connected to the larger system , forgetting that the collective 
response is key to contributing to goal . 
4 . 3Backcasting from Sustainability Principles
As more people become involved with co-creating the shared vision , the 
diversity of intentions can dissipate the focus and generate conflicts 
towards the common goal . This is a key reason why it is strategic to 
backcast from a vision that is constrained by the 4 Sustainability Principles . 
In order to coordinate all of its sustainability efforts , and ensure that that all 
aspects of sustainability are being addressed backcasting from the general , 
non-overlapping , sustainability principles can lead to a more desirable 
future . Specifically , backcasting can be applied as a planning method to 
allow for step-by-step strategic actions to carry the movement forward into 
53
a new , more sustainable future where new goals and new ways of doing 
business are realized ( Holmberg et al . 2000 )  . 
As outlined in the Methods there are different ways of defining ‘ success ’  
( see section 2 . 2 . 1 )  : for one individual this could be done by envisioning a 
desired future scenario and then taking the most strategic steps in order to 
attain it . For a large group of individuals though this process can be more 
difficult to do collectively as each person has a personal vision of the 
future . To ease the ‘ visioning ’ process for large groups of individuals it is 
suggested to envision success made up by general and concrete principles 
that can be agreed upon by a large group . Each member of the group then is 
able to create a personal scenario within the constraints of these principles 
( Holmberg et al . 2006 )  . 
In the previous section , 10 Slow Fashion Principles are outlined , which are 
based on what is already occurring in the movement towards contributing to 
a sustainable society . These principles are not meant to be prescriptive , but 
work as an inspiring and empowering tool for current Slow Fashion players 
and new potential members . The Slow Fashion Principles then , in order to 
represent a sustainable vision for Slow Fashion , should be constrained by 
the 4 Sustainability Principles , found at the ‘ Success ’ level of the FSSD , as 
they are rooted in science . By utilizing the principles in this way , the Slow 
Fashion movement will be strategic in its contribution to a sustainable 
society . 
The Sustainability Principles . The language of the Sustainability Principles 
is rather vague to ensure they are applicable to a wide variety of industries 
and businesses ; below we have added language to provide the Slow Fashion 
movement with a deeper understanding of them . 
The Slow Fashion movement will work to contribute to a sustainable 
society by ensuring that it will not subject nature to the systematic increase 
in :  
.  .  . Concentrations of substances extracted from the earth ’ s crust - These 
are materials such as fossil fuels for energy production or heavy metals for 
dyeing fabric . Their accumulation in the ecosphere contributes to global 
scale issues such as climate change and air , water and soil pollution .  
.  .  . Concentrations of substances produced by society - These are manmade materials such as synthetic fibres ( polyester , nylon etc ) or toxic 
chemicals used in textile processing and manufacturing and not kept in 
54
cradle to cradle loops . At their end of life they do not fully decompose 
leading to an accumulation in the soil and landfills , leaching into waterways 
and compromising human , wildlife and overall ecological well-being .  
.  .  . Degradation of nature - Many human activities undermines the health of 
the earth . They include relying on monoculture conventional cotton crops 
causing biodiversity loss , removing forests to harvest wool and agricultural 
crops for fibres , or polluting waterways with factory effluents . 
and in this society…People are not subject to conditions that 
systematically undermine their ability to meet their needs - There are 
currently many issues in the fashion industry that do not support an equal 
quality of life for all workers in the supply chain by failing to address fair 
wages and work place health and safety issues properly . Also , by neglecting 
the above three principles , the industry is undermining the ability of future 
generations to meet their own needs as they will not have enough resources 
to sustain themselves . 
Combined , these two sets of principles can be used to achieve 
sustainability , they are general so that they are widely applicable , and 
concrete so as to inspire and guide actions . The principles are meant to 
focus on what the movement can agree on as a goal , which is ‘ contributing 
to a sustainable society ’ rather than the smaller details of ‘ how to do it ’ 
4 . 4 Leverage Points
In this research we utilized the concept of Leverage Points to help us focus 
our attention on specific areas of the industry . This concept helped us 
remain focused rather than getting lost in the complex fashion system that 
is interconnected and vast . Although the term ‘ leverage point ’ is intuitive , 
the concept is complex . Donella Meadows herself declares that Leverage 
Points are easy to identify , but too often are used in a way which annul their 
strategic potential . 
Through the use of this concept , we identified many Leverage Points 
working to help the Slow Fashion movement achieve a variety of goals . We 
have also identified barriers that are preventing the movement achieving 
their full potential . Each Leverage Point has provided us a snapshot of 
action helping to uncover a foundation from which to build 
recommendations ; as now we are aware of where the movement is headed 
55
and its purpose , we can ensure our recommendations are within the 
movement ’ s desired direction as well as held steer it towards sustainability . 
4 . 5 Moving the recommendations forward
We developed a list of 30 recommendations for players in the movement . 
The three Prioritization Questions ( found at the Strategic Guidelines level 
of the FSSD ) were used to determine if the recommendations were strategic 
or not ( see section 3 . 3 ) and these questions allowed us to suggest strategic 
actions for players in the movement to take . Different players within the 
movement gave insight into what an individual within the system could 
actually ‘ do ’ to make these recommendations possible . Through interviews , 
it was acknowledged that one ’ s actions are limited by the structure of the 
system currently in place , not by their desire or creativity , but by the reality 
of the system they work within . This viewpoint informed our research and 
our recommendations and also fell within Leverage Point 10 . 
As described in section 3 . 3 , the three focus recommendations will require 
the utmost collaboration between a wide-array of stakeholders , from 
individual designers , global supply chain networks as well as cooperation 
between certification bodies and governments . As such , there are a number 
of challenges that need to be overcome to bring these recommendations to 
life . 
First , co-creating the Slow Fashion Principles and educating Slow Fashion 
players about sustainability to create a shared mental will involve time , 
energy and patience to ensure that the Slow Fashion Principles are widely 
distributed and discussed . We have begun an initial dialogue around the 
Slow Fashion Principles with our expert panel and a hand-full of designers ; 
however , we will be continuing this dialogue by engaging with more 
designers , along with NGOs and sustainable fashion networks to initiate 
this process . Due to time limitations , further engagement is beyond the 
scope of this thesis , however , we will continue to spread awareness of the 
Slow Fashion Principles and Strategic Sustainable Development well into 
the future . 
Secondly , collaboration between existing sustainable fashion networks and 
local Slow Fashion initiatives will need to occur to determine what role the 
Slow Fashion network will play and what gap it will fill . As mentioned in 
section 1 . 3 , there are already many sustainable fashion networks with the 
aim to provide a platform to share ideas and resources ( see appendix B )  . 
56
However , the Slow Fashion network will be specific to this movement and 
will focus on building local capacity and relationships , in addition to 
drawing on the existing resources provided by these global and national 
organizations . 
Currently there is a strong Slow Fashion presence in the UK where many of 
the active players are located . The UK is leading the way as a hub for the 
Slow Fashion movement , however , there still is no official network to join 
local communities and knowledge throughout the world with the strategic 
direction of the Slow Food movement . Informal community networks are 
what give the Slow Food movement substance , strength , and shared 
meaning and its website acts as a hub for knowledge and information 
exchange . 
By establishing a global network , Slow Fashion can become a competitive 
alternative to the current Fast Fashion industry and it will aim to promote 
an alternative model to help the movement collectively grow and become a 
contributor to a sustainable society . 
Lastly , it has been recognized that a consistent , widely known , third-party 
verified labelling scheme should be developed for the benefit of the Slow 
Fashion movement . This recommendation addresses Leverage Point 6 by 
providing a point of reference to communicate sustainability information 
from producers to co-producers . It would increase visibility and awareness 
around the sustainability impacts of fashion and would also provide an easy 
reference for retailers to discuss the garment with co-producers . It also 
supports Leverage Point 5 by removing the constraints caused by 
inconsistent labelling and buzzwords across the industry and by providing 
an incentive to source more sustainable materials and support sustainable 
supply chains . 
Most Slow Fashion producers are already sourcing certified organic textiles 
as well as other sustainable fibres , and are supporting fair wages and 
employment throughout the supply chain . In addition to this , some brands 
are going above and beyond most by supporting local economies and 
preserving local culture . By creating a one label that is comprehensive of 
ecological and social criteria , throughout the entire life cycle of the 
garment , it would allow for more consistency and provide an effective 
communication channel to co-producers . 
This recommendation will also involve extensive collaboration between
many stakeholders , specifically , existing labelling schemes , government 
57
agencies , the media and most importantly , those directly working in the 
movement . The Slow Fashion label could build off of current labelling 
initiatives , such as GOTS and Fair Trade , however , the most crucial factor 
to its success is ensuring that it is affordable and accessible for the industry , 
and visible to co-producers . Most Slow Fashion players recognize the value 
that a Slow Fashion label will bring to their business . However , those that 
already believe that they are ‘ doing the right thing ’ without being certified 
may not see the benefit to their business beyond added co-producer 
exposure . It is assumed that a simple , unified label will be one of the most 
effective ways to communicate to co-producers that their purchase supports 
the all-encompassing definition of sustainability ( throughout the entire 
supply chain )  . However , some fashion designers rely foremost on the 
garment design as the primary selling point and abide by sustainability 
criteria to satisfy their individual and business goals . Consequently , before 
this endeavour is undertaken , further research will need to be conducted , 
along with dialogue , to secure buy-in . 
4 . 6 Limitations and Validity
Time and experience were the largest limitations of this research project . 
Our field research needed to be completed and analyzed within one month 
leaving limited time to assess our progress and re-work direction as needed . 
Our team had different levels of experience within the fashion industry 
giving us different views of the fashion world . This encouraged exploratory 
discussions on ‘ what is fashion ’  . Each author of this report has a different 
personal meaning of fashion , which we believe is true to the essence of 
what fashion ‘ is ’  . What we could all agree on , which is one thing we feel is 
present in the industry and can make the move toward sustainability 
stronger , is that fashion today contributes to un-sustainability and it needs a 
strategic approach to change this . Whether fashion exists in buying second 
hand clothing , repurposing what you have , or buying a luxury brand , it all 
needs to contribute to a sustainable society by being conceived , produced , 
consumed and ‘ disposed ’ of in a responsible and reflective manner . Our 
report was developed on the grounds of what we all agreed on , which is 
regardless of the definition of ‘ fashion ’  , our human need to clothe and 
express ourselves must be met in a sustainable way ; and we believe the 
Slow Fashion movement is answering this call . 
Our method to discovering the industries ’ progress on each Leverage Point 
was through our literature review , survey and interviews . Each of these 
presented a separate limitation . In the literature review we had come across 
58
a large amount of documents that we could not review fully in the time 
allotted to complete the project . Materials chosen to review were the most 
up to date and relevant , and they answered a specific question pertaining to 
the research . Most of the contributors of the survey were from North 
America and Europe and the majority of participants were from the design 
and retail side of the industry rather than farmers , producers and 
manufacturers . A co-producer survey would have also been ideal , however 
with the time allowed we chose to focus on the back-end of the industry , as 
numerous consumer reports in our literature review provided us with 
sufficient information to complete this report . Our interviewees were also 
insightful but it is understood that each has a bias toward their area of 
expertise and we acknowledged that as we used the results from the 
interviews and survey ’ s in the report . 
4 . 7 Suggestions for further research
The authors have focused only on one side of the Slow Fashion movement , 
leaving out , for time constraints , the consumer / co-producer and its 
engagement . As well , the profitability and business case for designers to 
move towards sustainability ; the economic challenges presented by 
transitioning to a Slow Fashion model ; and , the specific developments for a 
new Slow Fashion label , were outside the scope of this research . For future 
research the following questions are suggested : 
What is an effective strategy for communicating the benefits of Slow 
Fashion to shift individuals from a ‘ consumer ’ to a ‘ co-producer ’ mind set ? 
As Leverage Point 2 suggests , changing a persons ’ mindset from a 
consumer to a co-producer can be challenging . At the ‘ system ’ level , the 
FSSD could be used for communicators to express the sustainability 
challenge and alter an individual ’ s perception of their connection to the 
system ( within society , within the biosphere ) to spark behaviour change . 
The FSSD can also assist to structure the complexity and volume of 
information used in the coordination and development of strategic 
communications . Future research could investigate how potential 
partnerships ( between non-profit , business , and education ) could strengthen 
individual efforts to lead to broader behavior change with fashion 
consumers . This could compliment the REAL Change programme , 
providing opportunity for various groups to partner with universities and 
implement research findings into practice . 
59
What is the business case for sustainability for small Slow Fashion 
designers ? Currently , the Slow Fashion business model presents both 
opportunities and challenges for designers . As we move towards a future 
with increasing resource and population pressures , adopting a Slow Fashion 
model will become increasingly strategic and beneficial . Exploring how 
strategic sustainable development and its supporting tools can be used to 
build a convincing business case for fashion designers to adopt 
sustainability , and the Slow approach , by outlining its benefits and 
challenges , is another area for further research . 
Using a strategic sustainable development approach , how can the 
transition from a fast to slow fashion industry be developed to ensure 
minimum impact of the developing world ? The author ’ s recognize that 
transitioning from a globalized fashion industry dominated by fast fashion 
to a new model aimed at slowing down fashion consumption and localizing 
production will have social consequences for the millions of garment 
workers in developing nations such as China and India ( Allwood et al . 
2006 , 34 )  . Studying the economic and social impacts of this transition is out 
of the scope of this thesis , however , this aspect could form the basis for 
future research . An emphasis could be placed on safeguarding garment 
employment in developing nations such that these workers are still able to 
meet their fundamental human needs . 
How can a Slow Fashion label be strategically developed and marketed 
using existing textile and garment labelling schemes , certification bodies 
and other stakeholders ? Through this research it is identified that labelling 
schemes to-date are difficult to sort through when at a retailer and making a 
purchase . If Slow Fashion could combine existing labelling schemes into a 
 ‘ master label ’ that is marketed to co-producers and easily identifiable it 
would give them the proper information to make informed purchasing 
decisions based on the entire life-cycle impacts of that piece of clothing . 
We propose to combine existing labelling schemes because there are many 
good ones out there for specific elements of garment making . However , an 
SSD approach can be applied to ensure that a proposed combination of 
labelling schemes for the ‘ master label ’ is strategic in nature . The Real 
Change program is currently researching ‘ Sustainability Based Product 
Labelling and Procurement ’  . A partnership between the Slow Fashion 
movement and this initiative could help eco-fashion labelling move toward 
sustainability .

5 Conclusion 
 " You never change things by fighting the existing reality . To change 
something , build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete .  " 
Richard Buckminster Fuller
The authors have shifted their attention from the predominating unsustainable Fashion Industry to a new model with a sustainable future : Slow 
Fashion . A number of initiatives have cropped up that , if strategically 
organized , may represent a concrete alternative to the mainstream fashion 
model . Brands and initiatives working with sustainability in mind , NGOs 
dedicated to safeguarding workers ’ rights or to spreading organic textiles , 
and even one-off creative projects , give life to this grassroots movement . 
The analysis of the literature review and industry survey through the lens of 
the FSSD , indicates that the Slow Fashion movement exists and is quickly 
flourishing , but at the same time its initiatives are highly unorganized and 
scattered around the globe , concentrating in only a few countries . This 
knowledge indicates that the movement currently does not have a common 
vision for the future or a shared definition of sustainability . Therefore , it is 
unable to operate strategically using a backcasting strategy . 
With the aid of the FSSD and a strategic tool to operate in complex systems 
called Leverage Points , many small points of intervention where a strategic 
move in the right direction could produce a big change in the whole system , 
were identified to strengthen the Slow Fashion movement and guide it 
towards future success . 
Finally , a number of short , medium and long-term strategic 
recommendations directed to different players in the movement were 
suggested as first steps in creating a stronger Slow Fashion movement . 
Three recommendations were identified to bring the most leverage to the 
movement : co-creating a shared vision of success for the future , that 
includes sustainability ( a first attempt was made by the authors who have 
unearthed 10 Principles for Slow Fashion )  ; establish a global network that 
would represent the movement as a whole , hold the Slow Fashion 
Principles , and provide guidance for all members ; and , create a unique 
Slow Fashion label that would unify the main eco-labels that currently exist 
but that are not being strategically utilized , to increase the overall visibility 
of the Slow Fashion movement .

84
4 . Do you have any plans to use any other sustainable alternative materials 
in the future ? Please provide details :  ( 30 answered , 16 skipped )

• Price and certification : Price is high and not regionally sourced . 
• Fibres are certified , but ‘ certification ’ is unclear at times .

• No network of material sourcing knowledge . 
• It is hard for designers to meet minimum orders from mills for better pricing . 
Lower minimums are needed ( 30-50 metres ) 
85

is done online and via mail ordering of samples . 
• Education is needed to increased demand and increase economic viability 
for materials .

• Fair trade certification is expensive . 
• Sharing material in a community can help designers ‘ practice with it ’  , 
however , it needs to be ensured that it all doesn ’ t look the same . 
• Get creative with local materials , they might not be traditional textiles . 
• Would like a direct link to Chinese producers instead of going through 
suppliers . 
• Lack of exposure to materials listed above needs to be addressed . 
• An intensive online material database / resource is needed for suppliers , 
recommendations , feedback , and fabric available by region…etc . 
• Many grey areas , such as ‘ organic ’ …it is hard to know if something is truly 
organic . 
• More selection is needed . 
• More transparency showing environmental impacts over entire life cycle . 
• Tax credits for organic and local materials should be implemented . 
• It is hard to communicate with foreign companies .

• Manufacturers could provide more information about the dye for garments . 
• We use low impact dyes due to large quantities . 
• There is misconception within the industry that all synthetics are bad , 
however , some do not use heavy metals . More awareness is needed 
around this issue . 
• Sometimes these dyes run on the 1 , 2 , 3 wash . 
12 . Are you interested in using natural dyes in the future ?  ( 31 answered , 15 
skipped ) 
Yes = 97% , No = 3%

27 . Does the retail price reflect the external social and environmental costs 
of producing the clothing ? For example , are clothing producers paid a 
living wage for their skills ? Do any profits go back into environmental 
preservation ? Please provide details on your price structure :  ( 25 
answered , 22 skipped ) 
• I am particular about the whole process from seed to finished garment to be 
ethically and organically produced . The price of our clothes reflects the true 
cost . 
• Our price reflects the cost of manufacturing domestically ; paying living 
wages and purchasing textiles that are much higher priced that 
conventional . 
91
• A percent of our profit goes to yayaan ( YKPA ) an orphanage in Bali . 
• Our profits go back into the business
• Yes . That is why I like to work with fabric from North America and have the 
sewing done locally .  ( I can not afford to check out conditions in third world 
places , but I ’ m open to working with co-ops in the future ) 
• We pay over minimum wage . We are not making profit and cannot afford to 
give to charity . However , we run workshops and give lectures / seminars to 
encourage people to think abut recycling and we educate the next 
generation of designers . Our price structure varies greatly due to the nature 
of the product . Some pieces costs a lot due to handwork . 
• Pay workers a living wage . 
• Produced locally
• Unfortunately the cost to produce keeps going up while the buyer wants to 
pay less . 
• We manufacture fair trade . 
• My dress line is priced slightly higher than average because of the 
 ‘ handmade in USA ’ stamp and the cost of production . 
• $2 from sales of most of our pieces go to local animal welfare / nature 
conservation charities . 
• Price depends on how long it takes to make . 
• 20% of what you pay for our garments goes directly to the development of 
the communities we work with . So far we are only working with the social 
aspect of fair trade . The environmental aspect is always in our mind and we 
will start investing on it shortly . 
• Our prices reflect the higher price point of local production , living wage , 
organic cotton etc . This ensures we are supporting organic farmers / mills 
and local production . It is an ecosystem that supports ethical production 
from start to finish .

• In 3 years but I do attend environmental seminars to learn what materials to 
use to safe the environment . 
• I do , but I am still a new company and have not really made a profit yet ! Will 
probably support a local child support group and one environmental group in 
the future
• We will be looking for charity work in the coming months , may not be directly 
related to the business
• When we make enough money , yes ! 
• We have supplied garments to charity events to generate profit for their 
charity . 
• I would like to work with local youth organizations , offering training . 
Industry Collaboration & Communication

issues ?  
( 26 answered , 21 skipped ) 
Yes = 39% , No = 61%
32 . If yes , what are some of the successes / challenges you have faced in this 
process ?  
( 11 answered , 36 skipped ) 
• We try to promote organic fibers and vegetable dyes locally by educating the 
suppliers . 
93
• I find getting information from the mills very difficult . It may be because I am 
still a small operation . 
• Discussions on certifications between my main supplier and I . More 
discussion overall , try to improve transparencies on fabric suppliers . 
• Success : really nice bright colors . 
• Challenge : Availability of organic cotton . 
• Challenge : price fluctuations
• We partner each year with St . Vincent de Paul ' s Discarded to Divine project 
where we raise the subject with the public while utilizing discarded garments 
to make new ones to auction for the benefit of the poor . 
• Hand woven and hand dyed fabrics are not perfect
• The supplier I was collaborating with went bankrupt and closed down . 
• Organic cotton is expensive and there are only a few suppliers who do not 
have a lot of stake . Therefore it is tempting to settle on other fabrics .

social / ethical ) of your operations to your consumers ?  ( 27 answered , 20

• People ’ s lack of understanding regarding the general environmental impact 
of the fashion industry . 
• Everyone talks the talk but no one walks the walk . 
• People don ' t feel it has anything to do with them / they can ' t change / they 
don ' t have enough money / don ' t want to be seen in the ' same ' clothes all the 
time / they follow ' fashion ' and want a different look every week to keep up 
with trends . 
• People are surprised at the fact that recycled materials look good . 
• Building a reputation locally . 
• Showing people how to work with clothes is a great way to encourage them 
not to throw them away . The website is in constant use by students and we 
are always happy to offer them one on one interviews to help with their 
studies etc . 
• Challenges on discussing the true price . 
• Success : loyal customers
• People are usually inspired to make a difference after our conversation
• I always enjoy being asked a question I don ' t know the exact answer to . It 
pushes me to look into things further and I ' m always learning about 
sustainability issues and better ways to do things . 
• It ' s not the ' selling factor ' - most customers don ' t care . But if someone is 
already purchasing something , and we tell them about sustainability and our 
work with the charity groups , they feel good about their purchase . 
• I have clients who will say point blank " I don ' t care about that stuff "  . 
• It ' s vital to make it totally clear what the clothes are made from and how , 
having it on the garment labels is probably the most successful
• Generally , people have very little knowledge & are very confused so they 
are impressed to hear my impressions about it all . 
• Communicating is either made too easy with marketing " green wash " or too 
complicated with metrics and technical terms that the average consumer 
doesn ' t understand . The trick is finding a balance . 
• No challenges , only advantages . 
• We have been successful in encouraging and increasing awareness on 
sustainability as customers have purchased items from our ethical labels . 
• I believe many consumers do not think about the origins of the products they 
consumer , I feel like we have lost touch with the process of creation , it is an 
important yet difficult task to try and educate people without being preachy 
or judgmental .

37 . Is your business or your suppliers impacted by environmental or social 
regulations ( Labour and ethical standards , Pollution control )  ?  ( 17 
answered , 30 skipped ) 
Yes = 47% , No = 53%
38 . If yes , please list these and describe how these impacts your business :  
( 11 answered , 36 skipped ) 
• Tighter EPA restrictions because we use domestic companies
• There are no restrictions in Indonesia . This impacts us negatively because 
people locally and internationally neither expect nor demand the regulations . 
We are trying to pioneer this demand and expectation on the local level . 
• Many of our fabric suppliers have developed production with lower impact 
on the environment and are still working towards these goals . 
• Suppliers are regulated , prices are not as sharp and quality is good . 
• Season affects the quality of silk and we are constantly waiting for the 
supplier to get his shipment from India . 
• Canadian labour laws ensure workers at the manufacturing facilities we 
work with are paid fairly , entitled to vacation pay , etc . 
• They are all members of WFTO . 
• Labeling can often be mandated to the point of trivial information at the cost 
of the business
• I only work with companies that can supply certified goods .

39 . Will future regulations impact your business or your suppliers ( for 
example EU REACH , extended producer responsibility regulations , 
carbon taxes , environmental regulations )  ?  ( 19 answered , 28 skipped ) 
Yes = 53% , No = 47%
40 . If yes , please comment on how they will impact your business :  
( 12 answered , 35 skipped ) 
• Increased cost of production and sourcing . 
• For us to be certified under the ‘ Fair Trade ’ label it will cost us thousands of 
US dollars . It is unaffordable . It is is meant to support sustainability , why is 
the price so unattainable ? 
• Hopefully carbon taxes will give us an advantage as we are now so low on 
carbon usage throughout our production . 
• I assume carbon tax will effect ocean shipping costs , more regulation in 
China will make prices rise too , even in good factories . 
• I guess so , and have no idea how . 
• If future regulations cost money , we might not survive , as we are a small 
business on a tight budget .  . 
• Taxes are currently too high . 
41 . How do you keep updated on changing regulations and standards ?  
( 15 answered , 32 skipped ) 
• Online research
• I rely on Canadian labour laws for my local manufacturing . 
• We are involved with EFF and have regular contact with lots of other key 
brands in our sector . We do not meet the criteria for most standards , as we 
are making recycled and most regulations effect virgin fabrics . 
• Word of mouth
• Talking with other designers on the internet . 
• Read the news . 
• Industry newsletters ( from different sectors as well . 
• Through the CFIB
• I do not
97
42 . Please provide any general comments on how regulations , standards 
codes of conduct provide opportunities or present challenges :  ( 10 
answered , 37 skipped ) 
• I personally contact subcontractors and fabric suppliers to know the process . 
• I have not had to deal with this yet . 
• If we can meet standards and regulations they will benefit us and quality us 
as an ethical business with publicity opportunities . 
• We will tell the story behind the garment
• More regulation and talk about the environment is good for our business . 
But the regulations are more like recommendations and are not enforced . 
• The USA is not regulated , it is self-imposed rules .

44 . If you use eco-labels , do you see how can be improved ? Please offer 
suggestions :  
 ( 8 answered , 39 skipped ) 
• I do not know where to get them . No supplier I can find has these listed . All 
of my clothes are made in the USA
• It can be better marketed so people know what the certification means . 
• The money from these goes to the West and not poor communities in the 
East . 
• Transparency and pricing could help as they all cost a fortune and it is hard 
for a small company . 
• We need clear labeling . 
• I use my own version of these labels when in production with my goods- i 
have not received any labels from outside agencies . 
45 . If you do not use eco-labels , can you tell us why not and what are the 
biggest barriers for a company to be awarded an eco-label ? Please 
provide details :  
 ( 12 answered , 35 skipped ) 
• Very expensive to have individual designs certified . Instead I choose 
transparency ( where is the garment made and with what ) and I show the 
organic certification of the fabric . 
• Control of supply chain
• Start up issues 
• Time , no time to seek it out . 
• Money required to attain label makes it not worth it to us . We know we are 
fair trade and act socially and ethically responsible . 
• Existing eco labels are to weak in their marketing . We need ONE strong 
system that is well known by consumers and there is confidence in it . 
Maybe three levels . 
• I was not aware of eco labels before this survey . 
• Our small size gives us control of the product . 
• We are investigating the other eco-labels to see if we can qualify for them . 
46 . Would you support a globally recognized , third party , eco-label to certify 
social and environmental impacts for the entire life-cycle of the 
garment ?

Slow Fashion
47 . In general , what does ‘ sustainability ’ mean to your business ?  ( 14 
answered , 33 skipped ) 
• The direction everything in on our earth needs to go .  .  .  . consuming only 
what you must , buying only what you need , and creating with an awareness 
that everything we eat , wear , buy has an impact . 
• That our lifestyle is in harmony with the nature so the environment we know 
today with humans , animals and plants can also exist in 7 generations from 
now . 
• Providing a framework and network between people in which fashion is 
valued and enjoyed and the stories behind the production of manufacture 
are shared and transparent . That there is no such thing as waste and a 
culture of passed on clothing exists amongst the majority of people who can 
easily access and be taught techniques or skills to restyle / alter / repair their 
garments
• Using eco friendly materials that natural fibers and help the green economy . 
• Trying to make the smallest impact on the environment while still running a 
business and making money . 
• Keeping cash flow
• Keeping creative
• Repeat intelligent customers
• Everything , it is not just a practice but a lifestyle
• Utilizing materials that can be recycled . 
• Sustainability is not just confined to our product ; it is everything on the 
business side as well . We want healthy relationships and employees so that 
they provide the best they can do and everyone is happy ! 
• Not over producing any collection , we only produce to order and never 
destroy our garments . Raw materials are all used up and never wasted . This 
is natural with a small business as everything is very tight and well used . In 
ensuring that very little is wasted we then in return hope that the customer 
will respect and care for their item , prolonging the life of the garment . 
• We want to be able to run a business that supports artists , supports us and 
does as little harm as possible to the environment . 
• Quality made , long lasting versatile and classic lined garments are 
sustainable .  .  . instead of the one season , trendy designs that don ' t last . 
Having garments made in a production house that pays fair wages , has 
flexible working hours . This creates for a more quality made garment and 
being environmentally conscientious in all aspects of sourcing , from fabrics 
to office supplies , etc . 
• At present the most important meaning of the word sustainable is in 
reference to our financial set up and as we are growing and incurring 
increasing costs , we need to make sure we can secure enough business per 
season to cover them . Also we have now employed a full time member of 
staff and our price point has gone up so sales are the key to sustaining our 
business at present . We will aim to continually improve the environmental 
100
sustainability in future by investing in new fabrics , processes and techniques 
whist making discerning choices about which ones we invest in . 
48 . What would be the benefits for your business of joining the Slow 
Fashion movement ?  
( 23 answered , 24 skipped ) 
• Learning more about what other companies in the industry are doing and 
cross-educating both other manufacturers and consumers with new or 
exciting ways of doing things in a more sustainable way . 
• Strong focus and cooperation for a sustainable fashion industry . 
• To link with others who are passionate about the same values and to learn 
the ways in which they inspire others
• This will allow my products to be sold with the new green movement . 
• It aligns with my company mission
• We are not interested in joining a movement or labeling ourselves . 
• We aim to offer a constant / trans-seasonal range , moving closer to ' slow 
fashion '  . 
• I ' ve thought about switching to an ' open ' line and moving away from the 2 
seasons per year production . It ' s a hard switch though because the retailers 
are so used to booking their orders twice a year . 
• Our work would be appreciated on another level , access to a market that 
values handmade , locally made , and thoughtfully sourced materials . 
• Communicating to the customer the benefits of sustainable fashion . 
Educating and encouraging the consumer . 
• Benefits would be great for the workforce in Vancouver and organic cotton 
grown in USA
• The benefit is to the planet . 
• I have been producing slow clothes since the late nineties and I am not 
about to change that . I am passionate about making a change in our 
consumption habits and educating the public forum on the practices that 
continue to exist in the industry . It is equally important to me that I educate 
people on the work I do and why it is so important culturally , socially and 
economically in today ’ s society . 
• We joined before you had a label ! 
• It ' s my personal value and beliefs . 
• Meeting and possibly collaborating with like minded people , information 
exchange
• We are all about Slow Fashion , I come from over 11 years working as a 
designer for high street and I hated it so much that I started my own 
business to prove to people that slow fashion is possible and that is the 
future . 
• Further driving the industry forward on tackling ethical issues rather being a 
hindrance on sustainability . 
• Not sure
• I am happy to do what I believe in 
101
• Power in groups and educating without carrying all the weight
• Brand awareness
• I believe I am already a part of that movement . 
49 . Would you be interested in connecting to others in the movement ?  
( 27 answered , 20 skipped ) 
Yes = 100% , No = 0%
50 . In general , what do you think it ' s missing and required for the Slow 
Fashion movement to be stronger and to reach a wider consumer base ? 
Please provide your comments :  
 ( 22 answered , 25 skipped ) 
• Grass roots activism . It is all fine and good for us all in the industry to talk to 
one another . But we already know all the problems and we are already 
working towards solutions . But what about the workers in the textile 
industries in developing countries ? What about other manufacturers for 
large multinationals in areas where there are no regulations ? We need to 
get out and be speaking with and educating those who know nothing about 
global warming ; it ' s impacts , and their options . It is silly to bring sand to the 
beach . 
• I don ' t really know enough about it to know what is missing . 
• There are not any seminars focused on the sewer , buyer , designer in using 
there materials to help our environment . 
• Simplify terminology , labels , and accreditation so consumers don ' t have to 
do so much research to learn about what they are buying . 
• PR , if we want to work as part of the fashion industry and compete with 
people who work without strong ethical codes we have to as good as them 
at PR , advertising , branding , etc . 
• A friendly network to share information . On the business side it is all very 
secretive , no one wants to give away suppliers etc . To have a neutral 
platform to go for information would be great . Interestingly the UKFT . org and 
launched a ' lets make it here ' program linking UK business and 
manufactures together . 
• Visibility . 
• More internet presence : websites devoted to slow fashion . Bringing the 
consciousness out to the public more . Changing the way people think about 
buying clothing . Changing the idea that lines need to be booked twice a year 
at the same times each year . 
• People have to care about production chain , people are becoming more 
apathetic about fashion chain , grown ups think it is acceptable to shop at 
forever21 and throw shirts away after 2 or 3 washes ( because they fall apart 
102
and look gross ) but still , this is unacceptable for working people and should 
be left to high school kid ’ s . People should be more aware about how much 
they buy and throw away . 
• Education
• Promotion
• More media coverage and education not to mention the industry recognizing 
its importance . 
• Press , global awareness - a " whole foods for clothing " 
• When bigger labels start becoming more eco-friendly is when the consumer 
will have a different approach to these issues . We need more media 
attention as well . 
• Attraction rather than promotion
• The fear to be lifted , it has to be attractive , luxurious and affordable for 
people to join . 
• To be further promoted within the industry . 
• Product , product & product . Also deal with the politicians and the high street 
retailers to band fast fashion as they have put higher taxes in alcohol .  .  . fast 
fashion is causing big problems all over the world and we need the power of 
politicians and the greediness of high street retailers to change this
• Consumers have been demanding eco-fashion for a long time . Everyone 
says they are willing to pay more for something made ethically and 
sustainably by local designers . However , people still spend more at H & M 
and other retail giants for the cheap fast fashion . I think the culture and 
attitude towards spending needs to change before we all get buried in a 
mountain of garbage .  .  . but how ? 
• When Joe 6Pack gets it , then it ’ ll work . Throwaway clothing needs to stop 
being the norm in the US .
