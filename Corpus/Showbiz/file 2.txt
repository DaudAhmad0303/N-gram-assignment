Express Your Creativity 
with Clothing You Design
Yourself ! 
Think you don ’ t have what it takes to design your 
own clothing ? 
Nonsense ! 
Clothing design is little more than taking a variety 
of style elements and putting them together in 
creative new ways . Change a sleeve , a collar , the 
shape of a skirt – and you ’ ve just designed a new 
style ! 
5
When paging through a magazine or watching TV 
or a movie , do you notice what people are 
wearing and think ,  “ That looks fabulous !  ” Or – 
 “ Wow , that ’ s not a good style for her shape .  ” 
One of the first steps to designing your own 
clothes is recognizing good design and what 
appeals to you when you see it on someone else . 
Do you often look at a garment and think ,  “ I love
that neckline ”  , or “ What a beautiful sleeve ”  , or “ I 
love the way that skirt flows ”  . 
If you do , then you are a designer ! Being able to 
pick out styling details – and identify why you like 
a particular garment – allows you to get 
inspiration from those details and use them in 
your own designs . 
If you sew your 
own clothes from 
commercial 
patterns you buy at 
the fabric store , 
you already make 
design decisions 
regarding style , 
color , and fabric . 
And when you shop 
for clothes , don ’ t 
you often think ,  “ I 
don ’ t like… .  ( the 
color , the collar , 
the sleeves… )  ”  ? 
You ’ re making 
design decisions 
then , too ! 
If you ’ re ready to step up to the next level and 
create your own fashions , I ’ ll walk you 
through the process of putting together your 
own styles . 
Fashion is little more than taking simple 
design elements and putting them together in 
your own unique way . 
It ’ s kind of like a jig-saw puzzle , or playing with 
paper dolls . You mix and match sleeves , 
collars , skirts , and so on until you get a 
pleasing arrangement – voila ! You ’ ve 
designed something !

Planning Your Design
There are certain aspects of design , both 
practical and aesthetic , to take into 
consideration when you plan a garment . 
For example , if you want to design a dress , you 
may ask yourself : 
• Where do you plan to wear this dress ? For 
what kinds of events or activities ? Is it 
 “ dressy ”  , business-like , casual ? 
• Keeping the purpose of the dress in mind , 
do you want it long ? Short ? Somewhere in 
between ? 
• Where do you want the waist to sit – at , 
above , or below your natural waistline ?  
( this will affect the type of skirt and bodice 
you choose ) 
• Do you want the bodice close-fitting or 
loose-fitting ? 
• Do you want the skirt slim , A-line , gored , 
full , pleated ? 
9
• Or do you want a dress without a waistline 
– a sheath or a full , flowing style ? 
• Do you want sleeves ? If so , are they long , 
short , ¾ length ? Full or fitted ? With or 
without a cuff ? 
• If you don ’ t want sleeves , how about 
straps ? Or strapless ? Or just a sleeveless 
bodice ? 
Once you ’ ve decided the basic form and 
function on your dress , you can choose almost 
any combination of design elements and come 
up with a great-looking garment .  

10
Elements of Design 

The design details you ’ d use to distinguish 
your style include the shape of the neck 
and / or collar , the length , shape and fullness 
of sleeves ( with or without cuffs )  , the shape , 
length , and fullness of a skirt , or the length , 
shape and fullness of a top or blouse . 
These style details - like bell sleeves , full 
sleeves , shawl collars , V-necklines – can be 
added to a basic bodice or blouse in any 
number of combinations , each creating a new 
and different style . 
The examples on the next page are all basic 
blouses – but each has different styling details . 
One has a Peter Pan collar and full sleeves , 
another has a shawl collar and short sleeves , 
and another has bell sleeves and a V-neckline . 
Each as a different look – but all are based on 
the same basic body . 
11
Re-arrange these basic design elements , and 
you can create any number of different 
blouses ! Put the shawl collar on the fullsleeved blouse , or the Peter Pan collar on the 
12
short sleeve blouse – or any other combination 
of details you choose . 
If you love the neckline you see on a blouse , 
imagine it on a dress , in a different color and 
fabric , or on a casual top . 
Design is all about trying different 
combinations of elements until you find one 
that appeals to you . 
It ’ s the details that make a great design , but 
don ’ t overdo it . 
Don ’ t put too many details into one garment . 
They will compete with each other and you ’ ll 
lose the impact of each one individually . 
Each detail speaks volumes – too many 
and you ’ ll have a shouting match ! 
13
Designing with Darts and Seams
Darts and shaping seams 
can also be used as design 
elements . 
Princess seams are 
commonly used to give the 
garment shape and fit . But 
they also add style to a 
plain sheath . 

The yoke on a skirt is a shaping seam which 
also functions as a design detail . The yoke 
allows the skirt to fit closely through the hips , 
and adds detail to an otherwise simple skirt . 
14
Your Basic Block or Fitting 
Pattern 

Before you design your 
first garment , you ’ ll 
need a pattern block –
one that fits you like a 
glove . 
A pattern block , or basic 
block , is a simple 
garment , with 
absolutely no styling 
details . 
It is , frankly , a very 
boring fitting dress !  ! 
But that boring dress is 
like a blank slate to 
which you will apply 
your design magic . 
You ’ ll make fit adjustments to this basic dress 
until the fit is perfect – then you can add 
whatever details you like , to design fashions 
that fit and flatter you . 
15
Simple Variations on the 
Basic Block 

Dress with 2-piece look 

This dress is a simple 
variation on the basic
block . The 2-piece look
with contrast skirt keeps 
the waist seam , adds a 
belt , and moves the 
bodice darts to the neck . 
Starting with your 
basic block , you ’ ll add 
 “ style lines ” and 
details to create your 
masterpiece . 
Style lines are 
changes to the 
pattern used 
primarily to achieve 
the look you want , 
not for fit . 
You can get some very 
nice looking dresses , 
blouses , and tops with 
just a few style lines 
added to the block , 
and details like belts , 
sleeves , or collars . 
16 

High Waist Dress with 
Full Skirt
This simple dress
keeps the fitted 
bodice with 
flattering princess 
seams replacing the 
darts for fit . 
The skirt has soft 
pleats that swing 
nicely – using a very 
simple adjustment
called “ slashing and 
spreading ” to add 
shape and fullness 
to the skirt .  




17
The “ Illusion ” dress has 
shaped panels at the 
sides to give the 
appearance of a 
smaller waist . 
Like princess seams , 
the side panels not only 
add color and shape , 
the seams function as 
darts or shaping seams 
to customize the fit 
without the use of 
waist or hip darts .  
 
 “ Illusion ” Dress with 
Contrast Side Panels 

18
Tunic with shaped yoke
There are almost 
unlimited options 
when it comes to 
sleeves , necklines , 
skirt shape , blouse 
or top length and 
overall fit . 
Use the bodice of 
the basic block to 
make a top or 
blouse – the yoke , 
bell sleeves , and 
slight flare at the 
hem are all style 
lines that create this 
easy-fitting style . 
The yoke effectively 
 “ hides ” the bust 
darts , too , giving 
the top a nice fit 
over the bust 
without noticeable 
darts . 

19
Or , turn it into an 
unstructured jacket 
with curved overlap –
it ’ s really just a minor 
variation on the bodice 
block ! 
Design is , to a great 
extent , just a matter of 
 “ mixing and matching ” 
those elements until 
you have a style that 
you like .

with Curved Opening 
and Bell Sleeves
20
Or keep the casual 
sleeveless look , but 
make the skirt full 
and swing-y – a very 
different look ! 
For example , add 
bracelet-length
sleeves to the 2-
piece look dress and 
the dress looks a bit 
more elegant . 

Just switch the details around , and you have a 
new style . 
21
All of these styles – and many , many more -
can be made using the simple dress block 
described at the beginning of this chapter . 
Learn how to do a variety of sleeves , 
necklines , yokes , and other design elements –
and you can design anything !  


22
Maintaining Balance and 
Proportion 

As you ’ re choosing the individual parts that 
make up you dress , keep in mind proportion –
both yours and that of the dress itself . Some 
shapes will look better on you than others and 
I ’ m sure that by now you have a pretty good 
idea what works on you and what doesn ’ t . 
In general , the parts 
of your garment 
should give a sense of 
balance . A long tunicstyle top over a 
below-the-knee skirt 
seldom looks 
balanced . 

23 


Long over short or short over long looks better ! 
In a similar way , full and fitted balance each 
other . 
A full top over a full 
skirt is too much ; it 
adds pounds 

24
The same full top over a slim skirt is much 
better , more balanced . Or , a more fitted top 
with the full skirt works well . 

Finally , keep your own proportions and body 
shape in mind . 
Many larger women ( like myself ) gravitate to 
oversized clothing to hide their size . But in 
reality , excess fullness just makes us look 
bigger ! 
25
Tight-fitting clothing , on the other hand , often
looks like we ’ ve outgrown the item ( and 
sometimes , that ’ s exactly what ’ s happened !  ) –
and it ’ s also not flattering . 
But a natural fit , relatively close but not 
binding , with well balanced design , looks 
great on everyone . 
26
Design with Fabric and 
Color
The final selections for your design are fabric 
and color . These are often the most important 
considerations , and a change of fabric , print , 
and / or color can make the same dress look like 
an entirely new style . 
The softness , stiffness , drape , or “ hand ” of 
the fabric is a very important consideration 
when choosing a fabric for your dress or 
garment . 
A circle skirt , for example , can be soft and 
flowy , or it can stand out like a poodle skirt . 
Dior ’ s New Look of the 1950 ’ s used full , circle 
skirts ( worn with a crinoline ) for a shape that 
emphasized the waist by flaring the skirt . 
27
A circle skirt in a soft 
fabric drapes nicely
The same circle skirt , in 
a firmer fabric holds its 
flared shape . 
For a full skirt that hangs and moves 
beautifully , use a fluid fabric like crepe or 
challis . For a flared skirt , use a firmer fabric 
like taffeta or poplin . 
In another example , a very soft , flowing fabric 
will not work for crisp-looking pleats . The 
pleats won ’ t hang properly and won ’ t have a 
nice , neat edge . For crisp pleats , use a firmer 
fabric like wool or linen . 
28
Some styles can be made in both soft and 
firmer fabrics ; you ’ ll just get a different look 
with each . 
A gored skirt , for 
example , is not too full 
and tends to fit fairly 
closely through the hips . 
In a soft , loose weave 
or knit fabric , the skirt 
will swing and flow 
easily .  



In a firmer fabric , 
like a light-weight 
denim , it will have 
more structure and 
shape . 
Notice how the 
addition of a 
pointed yoke and 
contrast 
topstitching
29
gives this skirt a very Western feel – just 
changing a few simple elements gives you an 
entirely different look . 
Get to know your fabrics and how they react 
to the construction of the garment you want 
to make . 
Feel the fabric you ’ re considering and lift it 
from the bolt . Does it hold it ’ s shape or drape 
loosely ? Both are good features ; you just need 
to be aware of when and how to use them . 
30
Changing the color or print of the fabric can
also make a garment look entirely new . 
A basic dress with waist wrap may be 
sophisticated and dressy in a nice black crepe , 
or light and casual in a bold graphic print . 

It ’ s the combination of silhouette , fabric 
and color ( or print ) that determines the 
 “ look ” and feel of a garment . 
31
Where to Find Inspiration for 
Your Designs
Where do you go to get ideas for your designs ? 
Almost anywhere ! If you want to stay current 
with the latest trends , you can find inspiration 
from other designers . 
By “ inspiration ”  , I do NOT mean that you 
should copy other designers . You ’ ll want to 
create your own look and reflect your own 
personality , not that of someone else . 
Look for specific details that you can 
incorporate – the neckline , the hemline , the 
fabrics or embellishments used - and use it in 
a new and different way . 
For example , a peplum is a nice detail that 
defines the waist – you can add it to the 
bottom of a blouse or the top of a skirt . 
32 

The peplum top is a fresh 
take on a simple blouse –
it ’ s a great shape for 
almost every body type . 

The uneven hemline 
and turtle-shell print 
of the simple 
sleeveless top update 
a straight black skirt . 
Uneven or asymmetrical hems make a top , 
blouse , or dress more interesting and can be 
used on almost any style . 
33
Follow fashion magazines on Facebook or 
Pinterest , and read print issues . 
If you love celebrity fashion , watch the red 
carpet entrances of award shows . While you 
might not need an evening gown , some of the 
details can be translated into a cocktail dress 
or more casual wear . Look for trends , like the 
height and shape of hemlines , symmetry , the 
shape of sleeves ( or the lack of sleeves )  , and 
the shape of necklines and skirts . 
Many catalogs and retailers also have current 
fashions , designed for everyday wear . Follow 
your favorites and you ’ ll find lots of details you 
can put together into your own interesting 
style .

Color-blocked Mondrian 
Dress with a ‘ 60 ’ s Feel Navy Sheath with a 
Van Gogh inspired 
print
You ’ ll also get inspiration from the art world 
( the art-inspired , color-blocked Mondrian 
sheath , above , is an example )  , from historic 
fashions , or from ethnic costume . 
Pinterest is a fabulous resource for vintage 
fashions and ethnic designs as well as current 
trends . 
35
Explore the World and Find 
Inspiration in Ethnic Fashions 

The classic Chinese Cheongsam ( or “ Susie 
Wong ”  ) dress was very popular in the early 
 ‘ 60 ’ s in the US . 
The detail I love about 
it is the curved 
opening on the 
wearer ’ s right side . In 
the dress ( which is a 
very fitted sheath )  , 
this opening hides a 
zipper that continues 
along the side seam , 
to the waist . 
36
I ’ ve used it in a 
side-buttoned 
top
and a sleeveless 
summer dress –
the gentle curve 
adds interest to 
each garment , and 
retains an Eastern 
feel .  


How Would YOU Use this opening in a 
design ? 
37
Look to the Past for Historic 
Inspiration 

I love historic clothing . 
The late 1910 ’ s and early 1920 ’ s is a favorite 
period of mine .  ( If you ’ re a fan of Downton 
Abbey , you know what I mean )  . It ’ s a period 
when the big , Victorian full skirts gave way to a 
very long and slim profile . 
Women were just beginning to show their 
ankles , so dresses and skirts were still 
relatively long . The silhouette is long and lean , 
and you see the beginnings of the boyish figure 
so popular in the ‘ 20 ’ s . 
38
This 2-piece dress was 
found in a pattern 
book from the early 
20 ’ s ; it consists of a 
very long tunic worn 
over a skirt that stops 
just above the ankle . 
The original dress has 
a pegged skirt ( with a 
vent at the hem so 
you can walk ) and a 
belt that sits below 
the hips ( upper to 
mid-thigh )  .  

The belt has to be set that low to maintain a 
nice proportion for the overall style –
remember that this dress is almost ankle 
length and if the belt were higher , the overall 
length would be off-balance . 
39 

The belt is raised again 
when it ’ s shortened to 
a tunic ( here it sits on 
the high hip )  . The 
tunic version is very 
modern , but retains 
some of the look and 
feel of the original . 
When you remove 
the pegged 
underskirt and wear 
the upper part as a 
dress in itself , the 
belt needs to go up a 
bit to maintain 
proportion .  

40
Get inspiration from books , TV shows , movies , 
magazines , and online . There are tons of ideas 
out there – put your own spin on them ! 
Also remember to keep it simple – you might 
find literally hundreds of interesting details 
that you ’ ll want to incorporate into your 
designs . Don ’ t use them all at once ! One or 
two terrific details on a single garment is 
plenty .  ( A nice neckline and sleeve on a very 
simple dress or top , for example )  . 
If you pile on more details , they all get lost in a 
sea of “ stuff ”  . Highlight a terrific detail by 
focusing on it – don ’ t distract the eye with too 
many things to look at . 
You don ’ t need pattern books – you
can come up with terrific fashions , with 
the right inspiration ! 
41
Putting the Pieces Together
Designing is a lot like putting together a jig-saw 
puzzle . With a selection of collars , cuffs , 
sleeves , bodices or tops , and skirt or dress 
shapes , you can mix and match to your heart ’ s 
content – until you create a style you like . 
One of the tools a designer uses is a croqui 
( pronounced “ croak – y ”  )  . A croqui is like a 
paper doll , in that it is a basic body shape
without clothing . 
You use tracing paper to draw the design over 
the croqui ; the body allows you to maintain 
proper proportion for your garment . All of the 
styles in this book were drawn using the same 
croqui . 
The croqui also allows you to draw your 
garment with a little bit of style and the 
suggestion of movement . The better your 
artistic ability , the more stylized your drawings 
can be – as you can see , I ’ m not a great artist , 
but I can represent styling details in a simple , 
technical fashion . 
42
The following page has a croqui you can use 
for tracing , and to help you get started 
designing your own clothing . 
You can find many croquis online ( just google 
 “ croqui ”  )  , but most are designed for fashion 
illustration and the body proportion is totally 
unrealistic . If you ’ re designing for yourself – or 
your clients if you ’ re a dressmaker – you ’ ll 
probably want a more realistic body as your 
croqui . 
The croqui on the next page represents a 
female body with approximately 36 bust , 26 
waist , and 37 – 38 hips – not fashion model 
thin , and not plus-sized . Just “ real ”  . 
43 

44
So – you ’ re ready to get started on designing 
your own clothes !  !  ! 
Print the croqui , get some tracing paper ( or 
plain paper – just make sure you can see the 
croqui when it ’ s behind the paper ) – and start 
drawing !  ! 
Then use the patternmaking instructions at 
Clothing Patterns 101 to help you bring your 
designs to life . You ’ ll learn how to create your 
perfect-fitting block , and how to use that block 
to make bell sleeves , bateau necklines , wrap 
fronts , gored skirts – just about any design 
detail you can imagine . 
Have fun !  !
