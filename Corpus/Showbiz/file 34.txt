ado join me in welcoming Hollywood Brad
Pitt and India ' s Shahrukh Khan 
[ Applause ] 
thank you everyone thank you all right
thank you
you know I ' m just going to say it
because I ' m pretty sure everyone in this
room is saying it in their head this is
a pretty incredible moment bad faith and
Shahrukh Khan to the biggest global
superstars then one this is a very
special moment all right
good on you but this is not your first
time doing it no no we actually shot a
Mighty Heart here so we were here for a
few months got to explore a lot of
countries of fantastic experience
you know better they ' re locals in Pune
who got used to seeing you on the bike
and waving out to them yeah it ' s good I
got to scoot around on an old world and
field and put a helmet on and just get
out amongst the masses it was really
nice it was interesting both of you
actually started your movie careers
around the same time Brad Pellman Lewis
your big breakout hit released in 1991
and that led to this exciting long
career Shahrukh davana which was your
first film big runaway success released
in 1992 what ' s the secret to staying
relevant successful and influential for
25 years who you want to take that long
you know you obviously look I see a
little bit of luck but I also trying to
reinvent you know constantly trying to
look for something new something
different and and I you know fortunately
I guess we were able to survive our
mistakes along the way and I I think
just staying relative Yamini that I
think you know to be able to survive
your mistakes and mistakes were normally
things which are very close to your
heart you know and and if they went
wrong somewhere down the line the only
thing that keeps you going is the fact
that you are still surviving and you try
and do it as often as you can as much as
possible and I think he more than me
will tell you that you know to be such a
successful star around the world there
are a lot of lot more expectations from
you and you need to keep it very simple
then
you don ' t need to be trying to work for
those expectations or keep on doing the
stuff that people expect of you you keep
on doing what started you off which is
being relevant being novel trying to you
know kind of reinvent yourself and the
simple things which made you want to be
an actor in the first place
you know you both have enormous success
but also enormous pressure how do you
balance or how do you really combine
artistic integrity with commercial
success because that ' s a huge pressure
on both of you would imagine I say you
just have to make sure you get time for
yourself time for your friends time for
your family and let the next idea purply
and it ' s not it ' s not so difficult to
achieve a balance I ' m I ' m able to
compartmentalize pretty well the private
life and the public life how about you I
do that too completely I mean I as far
as work has come so I think what he says
is the actually the crux of it you know
if you can be leading your public life
which is on sets also yeah invariably I
think if you can protect it in terms of
that from your private life and your
private life from the public life I
think when you go back home and you ' re
leading the regular stuff that you ' re
supposed to do and in whatever form with
family friends I think it just keeps you
kind of grounded you know like like my
kids I mean more often than not don ' t
like my thumbs
yes and that ' s not really rewarded oh
this one was so boring copper said you
know it ' s like it ' s not the biggest
thing in the house pop arts film to do
well it is not a special thing it should
not be a special thing with family and
friends and invariably you know we make
friends even in the film industry and
then everybody kind of stops pushing you
along and saying no this was the best
thing you did the act was different I
think the real friends in the film
industry also tell you oh keep it simple
and keep it normal I think that ' s what
actually it really helps you and take
the pressure off that at home you are
nobody and as long as you ' re a nobody
with your friends and
whom I think you can be a big star like
that without a you know I would imagine
that it ' s not just me everyone in this
room I would imagine wants to know how
do you pick the films that you do how do
you decide what you want to do next as
an actor well for me it depends a lot
about you know who ' s telling the story
you know you usually starts with script
a good piece of writing and and the
decision to go investigate that and then
you want I want to surround myself with
filmmakers I respect because we are
ultimately putting ourselves in the
directors hands and and there and you
have a real freedom to go explore to to
to go out as far as you can go and you
know you ' re in really good hands so and
at the end of the day after I don ' t know
about you but after doing it so long I
want to I want to do it with with
friends and people I like and and that
seems to be more important than people I
surround myself with than me than
anything else
absolute when it ' s exactly the same
thing I even said it before that I
sometimes don ' t even want to know the
story as long as the people who are
telling the story of people I enjoy
working with as a matter of fact because
now in India there ' s so many new
filmmakers I don ' t know them I haven ' t
gotten to know them personally
and and it ' s not just doing it for a
friend but I try to spend a couple of
years with them before I start the
project sure you know just to be
comfortable I think you know after 10 to
25 years of work what matters to you
most is the people who are making the
film for you and the people that you are
trusting with whatever little bit of
talent you have and you say okay this is
in your hands now try and make me look
the best you can and I will completely
trust you and you can only do it with
people that you are you know kind of
easy with or friends like you said I ' ve
done that for large 15 years I ' ve really
never really worked out of what a lot of
people call the comfort zone well it ' s
not the comfort zone or maybe you
require that comfort to be able to tell
about this but you have talented friends
right
each bher that ' s insurance how long is a
how long is a shoot on a Bollywood film
it
dancing film about 120 days and 40 days
sometimes longer if things go wrong and
if it ' s a simpler firm than about 70
days its obscene with us when we don ' t
have dance yeah I would never make it in
Bollywood psyche and damn no I I can ' t I
can ' t make you dance in Bollywood really
make everyone dance and I think I think
it ' d be the first film in the last do
your role see into your life did it
change you do you do they stay with you
would you discard them I guess I guess
they kind of feed each other your your
individual life and what you ' re
investigating in the film it has to in
some way but I quickly discard them and
move on to the next and move on to the
next project I use a tongue which I
described a lot of film work and I call
it emotional I ' m extremely emotional
when I ' m doing it and then I ' m
completely detached wanted so I need to
I need to just move on to I can ' t stick
on to something and I ' ve been asked many
times playing this character rule has
changed your life no it hasn ' t you know
because like he said it it feeds off
your experiences and then you try to put
them into a character or a rule and then
you just once your experiences finding
of course the quirks that you put in or
any mannerism that needs to be put in or
research into a biopic kind of space all
that yes those I think you know just
technicalities as an actor that you
learn and work and prep for but beyond
that no I do one and I take a two hour
long bar on the Friday the movie
releases try it it works two hours and
then by Monday I ' m through with it I
don ' t want to be a part of it in yeah
with my one character that was just hard
to wrap your head around one character
more than other that was difficult to
get into I don ' t ask him about Benjamin
Button so I ' d ask him about a film I
forget the food like 12 monkeys yes yeah
I find amazing in that book a fantastic
I don ' t know how many of you seen that
true
was blank doing it that ' s where I became
a big fan of bread as an actor Burn
After Reading right and there ' s some
lots of thing
hundreds of them but I would I would ask
you just continue with that one the
Benjamin Button or any of these films
those were those were all difficult
especially 12 monkeys
yeah a lot about a insanity locking
myself in a room for a couple of weeks
and just seeing how crazy we could get
but now I know it ' s just part of the I
wouldn ' t call them all challenging but
it ' s what we do i wouldn ' t say any were
difficult some you know landed better
than others but but it just seems part
of the process part of the craft you
know I ' m going to speak for for most of
the fans and I ' m audacity but Fight Club
Tyler Durden
now that is fun that ' s just wonderful
yeah any time you you know something too
reverent and and and there ' s great piece
of writing and a real dear friend of
mine David Fincher directing and Edward
Norton no we mainly just laugh much like
this one actually
sorry for you putting in a character
that was hard to wrap your head around
you know because we have singing and
dancing in the films more of a kissing
you you can I also don ' t I ' m inability
is on the back because they have singing
and dancing I it does become and as you
know the commercial films the singing
and dancing does come in a set piece and
it ' s just part of no storytelling you
just have to do it because you have to
do it maybe in some films in the
background so you really can ' t a lot of
people say this and maybe I ' m going to
be speaking against them when I say this
but you can ' t really get into a
character if you have opinion dance
every 20 minutes in a song you know it ' s
not a musical it ' s not been laid out
like that
you ' re not playing I don ' t know how you
pronounce his name Bob Fosse you ' re not
you know if it ' s not all that jazz it
somewhere down the line it ' s just a song
and dance right I don ' t know I ' m sorry
to say how to dance in character
you know how would a expert in dance
industry be always do a regular dancing
sir it becomes difficult mainly when I ' m
playing a more realistic role like say
my name is Han
but then again those are the
technicalities it ' s not something that
you can ' t do it ' s challenging maybe you
spend some time prep it as well as you
can and hope it lands well like you said
but know it I can never say it as an
actor that oh this was so difficult it
took the life out of me no I don ' t think
there ' s been a rule like that all of
them are nice I find the ones which are
regular rules those more difficult to
play right especially in the Indian
commercial scenario that you just a
regular guy I ' m playing it you know if
they have crutches and stuff then it ' s
easier to create it how long do you have
to rehearse for the dancing set-piece
yeah I started out there ' s a movie many
years ago when I start what in 94 95 was
released a film called Baz eager and
that was the first time they had a
dancing them before me like a set piece
with a lot of dancers and I went for a
hustle I went for four days of lessons
and days day and night I used to go to
in the afternoon for the 4 : 00 a . m . in
the morning and I thought I ' m killing
and because the song that I ' ve done
before I was miserable at on the sets
was pathetic and then I came back after
four days and night and did the shot and
I was exactly the same decision and I
did it as badly and so about 20 years 15
years back I decided never to with us
because I can ' t get better so I just you
know as soon as I come on the bed I just
request the choreographer I start
touching the feet and also you
understand well just do it this much
only take one shot so they normally
shoot with me hello and the previews
actually made modify convert on this
invented this our punk style haven ' t you
haven ' t is you know there ' s a bit of
style that is kind of famous now where I
put my arms out yeah and I do nothing I
just put my arms up very similarly
so whenever anything goes wrong and
dancing with a this complicated steps
way you have to do all that so when when
they do that but hip-hop Big Bob what
rock and pop so when they do that stuff
I do you know what my character would
just stand like this
I ' m going to try that I hope he ' s just
happy I ' ll tell you sir one day one time
in a film I had to be an organist
playing organ an organ you ' re playing
with all four limbs hands and feet I
couldn ' t I couldn ' t even get the piano
part
unfortunately that you know they ' ve
shoot the hands and they cut down and
shoot someone else ' s feet but I couldn ' t
even get the piano part I couldn ' t get
both ends so what we did was I I had the
I had the bass line with the left hand
and what we did was we got another guy
who to play an organ whose hand looked
close enough and we cut a hole in the
back of my jacket and he slid his hand
through and I just did this he any he
made this thing work it looks great
walking up with movies we can go back
and Luria blood tree of last year when
you said to Associated Press recently
that as you ' re getting older you ' re
gravitating more to the producing side
than in front of the camera because
shooting a film is a big commitment is
that a hard balance to strike and shadow
can you release that well I was saying
you know it anymore as I as I get older
that you know it ' s a big commitment you
know it ' s there long days I don ' t know
about you but we ' re definitely 12-hour
days if not sometimes 14 even 16 if it
goes along yeah yeah and because you got
to get the shot and it ' s a big
commitment it ' s a big time away from
from family and more and more I find
myself doing less and less and
concentrating more on or these you know
on the on the production side and that ' s
been growing and and and I just I just
find it really rewarding to be able to
with my partners be able to open up
doorways for other filmmakers filmmakers
we really respect to make films and tell
their stories I just been putting those
out in the world I find that a special I
find that a real gift to be able to do
well I think like if you start from the
concept of wanting to tell story
and if you can last as long as they
bladders done and if you have partners
like the Jeremy and didi I have some
friends in my company and partners I
think that that ' s a natural way to go
that you will want to keep telling
stories and they only has so many
stories you can tell as an actor and as
age goes I mean you can ' t honestly be
doing the roles that you would love to
now but you can ' t it ' s nicer if you ' re
able to give that opportunity chance
platform and relive those things as a
storyteller and why being a producer
both of us had incredible success as
producers that your company Plan B was
behind two recent Oscar winning titles
moonlight and 12 years a slave among
others Charles you delivered the
blockbusters and ohm shanthi ohm and
Chennai Express but you ' ve also stuck
your neck out and taking risks with
songs like ahsoka and pas Haley and
Robin how do you pick what you want to
produce is there is that is there a
formula to it and is there a different
approach oh there ' s not a formula I mean
you know one you pick really good people
to work with people who are smarter than
you in in many areas and in my partner
is sitting right over here DB Gardner
and Jeremy kleiner we started probably
about 12 years ago roughly a little more
and and just one I mean we ' re figuring
out as we go along but you know we we ' re
all lovers of film and and and wanted to
you know just tell stories that were
relevant to our time and and again you
know promote filmmakers that that we
really believed in and and was a joy to
work with and to you know help clear the
way so they can bring their vision and
it that it ' s that mandate that has
worked really well for us has been
really rewarding for us as an experience
and and I think will will stay on the
you know that same kind of trajectory
again like you said you get people
around you who are smarter or at least
have a different vision or filmmaking
than just you and you know and you get
along with them and you kind of sit
together and work out initially when I
started I you know I ' m not from here to
become a producer was a big
for work but the bottom line was they
were a couple of films I was part of
initially and nobody wanted to produce
it and I won ' t name some of them which
got produced because I was not just part
of it but kind of helped them with other
producers because there ' s some really
wonderful films but my choice was that
whichever film nobody wants to produce
let ' s produce it and I was sitting with
my partner ' s Aziz and Joey once and
you ' re making a film and we were
thinking of partnering with someone we ' d
gone and pitched it a lot of people and
everybody can I said not this why don ' t
you do the lawn like the last one you
know that was successful when we went on
and there was a gentleman who always
taken those meetings with nothing to do
with films he was a construction company
owner had nothing to do with cinema and
he used to come and sit in the meetings
he was either his friend and he turned
out I said I liked to produce it and we
said but we big buildings he said but
you guys are so good I love what you do
and I ' d like to produce it so you lose
money he says all right to lose money on
you and I think it just came across to
us if there is someone who can lose
money on us let ' s try losing ourselves
and you know let ' s just go and make the
films nobody else wants to make so it
kind of started off like that but lately
yes I think my production company takes
care of Clyde to make a writer so we
keep it very simple trying on some money
and then actually make the films that
nobody else wants to make but you want
to tell the story but I think you will
appreciate and I ' m hoping Shahrukh will
back me up here that the Indian film
industry is really a different kind of
beast in that it ' s one of the few
cinemas that has succeeded in resisting
the massive influence in the onslaught
if you like Hollywood American movies do
very well in India but we have a very
vibrant film industry and and the
predominant film industry is the Indian
movie industry Shahrukh is there any
fear of that changing I said for the
last 10 years if we don ' t hone up in a
few areas and I would sail again
especially in script writing screenplay
marketing and professionalism and
technology if these five areas we don ' t
quickly adapt ourselves to the way
it ' s not only the studios but indecent
makers small producers make films in
Hollywood we would get taken over by
Hollywood because there ' s no denying the
fact they make some wonderful films
they ' re wonderful international stars
the language is becoming less and less
of a barrier with even more digital
platforms the access to them the
comparison is now right out there I mean
you just have to have a telephone to be
able to see any film that you wanted to
see it ' s not like going down to the
embassy to see the French film or
American film anyway young so I think if
we do not take on some of the wonderful
things that Hollywood has done before
and learn from them adapt them here
especially the professionalism part and
technology there is a big fear that ' s
interesting to hear because from a from
afar it ' s I mean we have great respect
because you do have your your own film
language you have your own Gestalt that
is that that ' s created it ' s homegrown
and and it just enjoyed over there so
it ' s really interesting really
interesting interesting to hear about
the least even the technology side and
it makes sense it just would have never
occurred to me yeah because we have such
wonderful stories here to tell but we ' re
not telling them in the way that I think
we get really happy just being sad
sometimes they do Indians film you know
singing dancing and everybody enjoys it
all over the world but if we are able to
understand the language Hollywood and
the Western cinema speaks and not change
our own way of presenting a programming
singing and dancing has to stay so that
we keep bad away from Bollywood yeah but
I think if you are able to somehow get
that writing part and technology and
it ' s important I think it ' s extremely
important it ' s a I find it really
interesting you know different different
cultures now cross pollinating ideas and
and styles and we just had a great
experience producing a film and another
Netflix film called ogia with long
joon-ho the South Korean director and
and it it just became something we would
never be able to create
from his mind and and I we ' re definitely
shaking out more of those experiences
and I think we ' re going to see that more
in the global community of filmmaking
that ' s going to be you ' ll be interesting
to see what comes out of it we ' re going
to at this point take a look at another
clip from war machine and then I ' m going
to bring out another guest
we tagged along for a couple days thanks
for having me sir it ' s a real privilege
rolling stone yes sir
speak sir I ' m on the cover well it ' s a
between you and Lady Gaga sir well I ' m
in the parks a bathtub with rose petals
hybrid Sheriff heads
stop donkey jelly seriously put me on
the cover
okay we ' re very lucky to have with us
today the director of war machine gave
admission and writer thanks happy I ' m a
surprise to the society the potential
for a scandal this year it ' s all
downhill from yeah Brad David why wasn ' t
it flicks
the right partner for for war machine
Brad you ' ve said that without the
delivery system like Netflix this movie
wouldn ' t have got made or if it did get
made it would have been at 1 / 6 the
budget only so why was that pick the
right partner yeah I may have
exaggerated maybe one-third but it
wouldn ' t been to the scope and scale
it ' d be you know it ' s because the the
way the studio system is the business
model of the studio system now in
Hollywood it just can ' t support
I ' m risky films like this films at this
budget certainly because of prints and
advertising being so high and the cost
the the ancillary costs being so high
they just they ' re just not getting made
right now so for me the beauty of
Netflix or delivery system like Netflix
for the for the film viewer is now more
films are getting made more interesting
filmmakers are getting to the plate
telling their stories which means a
greater variety of films for us to view
and so it for me it ' s this kind of
renegade new resurgence in in filmmaking
that I that I grew up on from the you
know mainly the 70s even the early 60s
and and it ' s really exciting time for us
yeah I mean it ' s exciting to me because
you know I made my first film Animal
Kingdom came out in 2010 I went to film
school back in the mid 90s and it was
right at that time as I was after
Quentin Tarantino ' s first couple of
movies it was a whole bunch of guys like
him and Paul Thomas Anderson and
Russell and where ' s Anderson and David
Fincher and they were all making what
looked like really bold unusual original
movies inside the studio system then my
first movie came out in 2010 and and it
had all done away you know the studio ' s
weren ' t making those kind the kinds of
movies that I thought I wanted to make
and I wasn ' t sure how I was ever going
to get to make them and then suddenly
this Netflix this mr . Netflix window
opens to me that was kind of
extraordinary I mean Warmachine is
exactly that kind of movie that you know
it ' s bold it ' s like it ' s it ' s it ' s it ' s
it ' s a it ' s it ' s complex but it ' s it ' s
wild I mean it doesn ' t feel to me like
how the movies feel it ' s exactly the
kind of movie that the traditional
Hollywood studios aren ' t really making
anymore you know it ' s a war film so it ' s
never going to be cheap to make and so I
just feel lucky that I ' m that you know I
didn ' t like my time going to film school
those years ago shut up in a market like
India how do you feel has Netflix
impacted or will perhaps energize the
existing landscapes exactly you know
this way that we ' re always going to be
tied down by this you know cinema
release films which have to be of a
certain set up for them to get back the
audience that you want and we can
collections the weekly collection the
monthly collections I think Netflix will
offer you an opportunity that this story
needs to be told it will be successful
successful also in China but some way it
doesn ' t have the pegs that are expected
or facile that should come in a theater
and you know take over the weekend
that ' s how art will grow and and Huggett
present the business will follow so I
think Netflix in the next coming years
five years giving opportunities to so
many directors and I think you like in
India I find every every household has a
single yeah I think every household has
a filmmaker making films for so long
everybody wants to make a film and I
think this is just the right time for
all of them to come on board
you have opportunities with companies
like Netflix and say okay I don ' t need
anybody else
I just mean this platform have the
freedom and get a little bit of money to
make a film everybody ' s not going to be
wanting to make that big so but you know
just have the freedom I think the most
important thing a market is the
filmmaking process absolutely like I
said it ' s not a film by committee it ' s
not a set of people telling you what to
do
just come and make your film and and the
best of films I think in the world were
initially made like that the sequels are
made by the committee ' s I guess yeah
there ' s also something else about
releasing the film through Netflix you
know so much and so many of our films
are often categorized by opening weekend
by performance of opening weekend and
it ' s it ' s a really unfair jury of of a
film longevity is the true test of a
film is it still playing there ' s still
speak to an audience ten years down the
road 20 years down the road and and and
I ' ve seen many good films be dubbed
failures that that and some have been
found later in time and some some
haven ' t some go away and I I think this
is taking removing I ' m interesting to
see removing that aspect what that does
to Lisa films reputation in the early
days what was she is based on michael
hastings book the operators about
General Stanley McChrystal short and
controversial stints during the US
invasion of Afghanistan Brad you said
that you could identify with the
character of the general because he got
caught in the trap of hubris just like a
movie star where you start to believe
and I ' m quoting you your own stink
Michelle you joked about being a
self-absorbed movie star at the recent
TED talk that you gave um do you see
self-absorption as a plastic movie stars
often colander and how then do you keep
a drill well first I ' ll say you know the
hubris conversation I was trying to
correlate that to to the film in the
sense that any mistakes I ' ve made is
when
is when you know I think I haven ' t
figured out and it seems that any
mistakes we ' ve made as a country is when
we we think we have all the answers and
it was that hubris that that that one
has to question for oneself for any kind
of personal evolution but also in what I
think we need to constantly be be
looking at in ourselves as a country to
come up with another solution and what
we ' ve been doing I mean I think yeah I a
certain amount of self absorption is
necessary for any creative person you
know you ' re not you ' re not a machine
water otherwise where you ' re going to
just be following or people think should
be done you have to have a free-thinking
head you have to have you know frames of
your own in your head I ' ll be telling
stories that you want whichever
paintings whatever so I think a bit of
set absorption it seems like it mainly
because you know you ' d like to say your
idea or your throat or your belief will
live by it it can seem a self-absorbed
rad Shahrukh both of you have been at
the forefront of major technological
changes and advancements in the movie
business I suppose it ' s only fitting to
ask all three of you as we wrap this up
what are the big foreseeable changes you
predict over the next 10 years in the
entertainment business who I don ' t
pretend to know yeah I don ' t you know I
think it is a very very interesting time
and things are moving very very fast
we ' re getting more connected with
reviewing or certainly our entertainment
in much different ways I I don ' t know I
usually I live by calling the audible as
we say well you know we we make those
calls you know at the moment but I
couldn ' t I couldn ' t say I I couldn ' t say
you I would say in an Indian context
more because I think the industry is
still kind of newer compared to the West
yeah so yeah technology is going to make
a huge play
and if you see a wonderful film like
bubbly those are that cinema you know
the event films so to say our own
superheroes I think we still haven ' t
made them enough so they will make a big
foray into it and with the platforms
like Netflix and suddenly in the last 10
years like I said so many new directors
and storytellers sprouting all over the
country you know you know we have a very
big regional cinema also south and east
and west
apart from Hindi speaking cinema and
it ' s really huge
and all those directors would get an
opportunity to come and tell a story
without having to be dependent on you
know just a few major players so to say
in Hindi cinema I think that ' s extremely
exciting you know I I read things now
and suddenly there ' s a new director
making a small certainly a set of boys
and girls have gotten together and you
know I think the next thing is the way
the kids are watching focus there
watching them differently they have
comparisons internationally now it ' s not
just your own school so I think that all
is going to change the way stories told
in India so I think our next five seven
years positively speaking very exciting
it ' s nice to say that but I think I
think it ' s going to change the balance
of power as far as filmmakers and film
like let ' s go David I mean some
advantages be I ' ll be interested to say
you know in which wise things kind of
stay the same you know it ' s very visible
obviously there ' s a lot of talk going on
at the moment about you know should
chills being theaters viral stuff that ' s
been going on it can obviously what
we ' re in is a kind of transitional
period you know you can feel these kind
of tectonic things kind of these
tectonic plates kind of crashing into
each other and stuff will change and one
of the things you hear especially with
streaming services and our bar is that
you know it ' s like the shape may change
and there ' s limited series and directors
can make six-hour movies and always and
I have you know I ' m less concerned about
where my movies play or what kind of
screen above what I love more anything
else is the shape of the feature film
you know it ' s that a movie that is about
two hours long
I just love that I love being able to
tell a story in that length of time I
love being able to devote a lot of time
to the making of it the crafting of it I
my great hope is just that whatever it
whatever shape the distribution and the
exhibition takes that that just the
shape of the the movie survived because
I just I love them I love the recessed
well is we ' re something to get there we
love it if you at 120 days shoot I ' d
kill for Navarre you feel like the world
will become a smaller place in that
there will be an exchange and you know
crossover will will we see Brad in a
hindi movie selves you in a Chinese film
you feel like that is the future as well
not so I learned a dancing string I mean
I don ' t hire kiya as long as wrinkle I
think yes most certainly I think in the
last 10 years itself you know you ' ll
have a lot of Indian actors going and
being except even if it ' s part of
diversity yeah angle that America has
but I think it ' s opening those these
from Australia he ' s gone made from there
I ' m sure if he likes India is visited
here he went for a long walk today if
you like that walk house a good one it
was a good walking they come and make a
film here it ' ll start off like that glad
shot a film here you know some other
filmmakers will come to shoot filming in
the airport I think they will understand
we ' ll see like we watch all their films
and understand the kind of language they
use yes I think I mean true I hate using
this word but this globalization yeah
yeah would happen more certainly thank
you gentlemen
