RODUCTION
1 . 1 INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY
The majority of psychology research in the past has focused on psychoanalysis and 
behaviourism in studying mental illness , maladaptive behaviours , and therapeutic treatments for 
these issues , while in contrast , the humanistic approach seeks a holistic view on individuals that 
focuses on self-awareness and mindfulness to motivate an individual ’ s inherent drive for selfactualization , or the realization or fulfillment of one ’ s full potential . The aim of positive 
psychology is flourishing , feelings of authentic happiness , fulfillment , and functioning effectively 
at a high level of mental well-being and it focuses on building and nurturing the most positive 
qualities of an individual ( Huppert , 2009a , b ; Keyes , 2002 ; Ryff & Singer 1998 ; Seligman , 2011 )  . 
The clothing we wear and the experiences we have wearing our clothing implicitly interacts with 
our moods , emotions , thoughts , attitudes , behaviours , and self-concept . There is only one empirical 
study conducted in the U . K . that has explicitly examined the connection between fashion and 
positive psychology ( Masuch & Hefferon , 2014 ) and the relation of hedonic and eudaimonic wellbeing to how women experience fashion . Through their grounded theory analysis , researchers 
identified clothing strategies women use to negotiate selfhood , accept their body , cope with mood , 
with all of these factors working together to manage their everyday well-being . Hedonic wellbeing , based on the notion of subjective well-being , can briefly be described as the immediate

moments of happiness and avoidance of pain , with high levels of positive affect , low levels of 
negative affect , and high levels of life satisfaction ( Ryan & Deci , 2001 )  . Eudaimonic well-being 
can briefly be described the factors that contribute to personal growth and development , such as 
self-actualization , the concept of becoming a fully functioning person ( Ryan & Deci , 2001 )  . 
Another study that has built on these ideas is an master ’ s thesis also from the UK that researched 
the relationships between clothing choices and well-being to determine how fashion , mediated by 
identity , positively impacts the happiness of the wearer ( Smith , 2017b )  . 
1 . 2 . PROBLEM STATEMENT
I am interested in how clothing can be used to elevate and reinforce an individual ’ s 
understanding of self-concept , boost self-esteem , and enhance their hedonic and eudaimonic wellbeing . I am proposing that individuals who have an understanding of self-concept , know who they 
are and the person they strive to be , have relatively high self-esteem , and are self-aware and 
reflective about the clothing they wear , can realize how wearing certain clothing can have a 
positive impact on their well-being . Clothing can enhance the way they think , see , and feel about 
themselves ; give them the confidence and drive to realize their full potential ; influence a positive 
well-being ; and help them flourish in all aspects of life . The intention for my Major Research 
Project is to explore the interactions and influences between psychology and fashion from a 
positive psychology perspective . I used qualitative interpretative phenomenological analysis ( IPA ) 
to gain a deeper understanding of how women choose the clothing they wear every day and how 
they experience wearing their clothing . The nature of this research required participants to be selfaware and reflective about their thoughts , feelings , and attitudes in order to understand how they 
experience clothing and in turn , how their experiences interact with the perception of self-concept

SELF-CONCEPT , AND WELL-BEING

and evaluation of self-esteem . The findings of this research will illuminate how clothing and an 
individual ’ s intrapsychic and interpersonal experiences impact their thoughts , feelings , and 
behaviour , with the intention of understanding how clothing can be a means to promote positive 
views of self-concept and well-being . 
1 . 3 RESEARCH AIMS AND OBJECTIVES
My research objectives are to determine how women experience the wearing of clothing , 
how they select the clothing they wear every day , and how these experiences are influenced by the 
cognitive and emotional appraisals of how they want to present themselves . By utilizing an indepth qualitative research approach and a small sample of women who are interested in fashion , I 
intend to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the interactions between these relationships 
to confer the findings of Masuch and Hefferon ( 2014 )  ; clothing practices to negotiate selfhood , 
befriend the body , and manage mood , overall to manage well-being ; and Smith ( 2017b )  ; 
intentionally manage identity through dress and the active role dress played in their well-being . 
By exploring this under researched area , I intend to contribute new findings to the field of positive 
psychology and fashion . The results of this study will launch future research that can shed light on 
the positive potential of fashion for well-being and also identify significant areas of study for 
fashion brands and consumer analysts . Fashion psychology can propel innovative market research , 
novel design , and enhanced brand experiences to maximize their influence on target markets . 
Throughout my research , I aim to answer the following questions : 
1 . How do women experience the selection of clothing and wearing of clothing in their everyday 
lives ?

SELF-CONCEPT , AND WELL-BEING

2 . How does one ’ s self-concept , self-esteem , and mood interact with their experiences wearing 
clothing ? 
3 . How can clothing be used as a styling tool to reinforce the self-concept , enhance self-esteem , 
boost mood , and in turn promote well-being ? 
1 . 4 JUSTIFICATION FOR THE RESEARCH STUDY
With hot topics in the media such as self-enhancement , wellness , well-being , and 
mindfulness , there is a huge opportunity to empirically investigate fashion through the lens of 
positive psychology . Although anecdotally we accept that fashion can make us feel good and uplift 
our mood , there is only one empirical positive psychology study that aims to understand the 
everyday experiences women have with their clothing and how clothing can be a positive influence 
on our well-being . Our psychology and the experiences we have wearing clothing everyday are so 
intimately connected to our body and mind ; individuals may not even realize why they select the 
clothing they wear and how that clothing affects their well-being and ability to function optimally 
and effectively in their day-to-day tasks . In psychology , there are many studies that seek to 
understand the factors and influences that can negatively impact our brain , health , relationships , 
and mental health . However , positive psychology is relatively recent area of research ( Seligman , 
1999 ) and through a literature review it was found that research on how clothing can be a positive 
influence on the self and well-being is under researched and outdated . I argue that this area of 
study is important to consider since clothing provides a physical and emotional experience that 
can influence the body and mind . This type of in-depth psychological inquiry can provide insight 
into women ’ s thoughts , feelings , attitudes , and behaviours that will allow for the exploration of 
applying positive psychology to nurture positive views of oneself and promote well-being through 
clothing , design , and branding . As other fields such as anthropology , cultural studies , and art

SELF-CONCEPT , AND WELL-BEING

history expand their inquiry into studying fashion , filling the gap and making the connection 
between psychology and fashion from a positive perspective would be an interesting endeavor that 
would generate new and insightful scholarship . 
1 . 5 BRIEF OUTLINE OF METHODOLOGY 
This study employed qualitative interpretative phenomenological analysis ( IPA )  , an 
approach developed within the field of psychology with an idiographic focus to understand and 
deliver insights into the personal lived experiences , instead of being influenced prior by 
psychological theories or the researcher ’ s own bias ( Smith , 1996 ; Smith , 2017a )  . This research 
project is an active interpretive process as I interpret the research and produce the knowledge that 
seeks to understand how these women experience their clothing ( Smith & Osborn , 2015 : 26 )  . This 
study recruited seven women in Toronto and Guelph , Ontario within the age range of 21-39 and 
employed the following methods similar to the techniques employed by Guy and Banim ( 2000 )  ; a 
personal account , a two week long clothing diary , and a wardrobe interview . The present study 
utilized an online personal account questionnaire asking questions regarding the participant ’ s 
interests and relationship with fashion and clothing , followed by a daily clothing diary for four 
weeks where they recorded their experiences and responses from a guideline as well as 
photographs of their daily outfits , and lastly an in-depth semi-structured wardrobe interview .

CHAPTER 2
LITERATURE REVIEW
2 . 1 INTRODUCTION
Fashion and clothing enthusiasts are too often regarded as frivolous , superficial , paying too 
much attention to the opinions of others and obsessing about how fashionable they look ( González 
& Bovone , 2012 , p . 167 )  . The topic of fashion from a positive psychology perspective has been 
under-researched and has the potential to be an enriching field of academic study . In contemporary 
psychology , the study of fashion has been presented negatively , as argued by Brydon and Niesson , 
some psychologists have deemed fashion as a pathology ( 1998 , p . 10 ) and research that explores 
psychology and fashion mostly focuses on body image , social psychology , more specifically 
person perception ( Lee & Choo , 2015 ; Frith & Gleeson , 2004 )  , or clothing behaviour in the context 
of psychological ill-being . Psychology research on body image and clothing behaviour depict 
clothing practices as one of the signifiers that predicts body-image disturbances and furthermore , 
evidence suggests that clothing practices can be used as a behavioural avoidance strategy to detract 
attention from body image and eating disorders ( Trautmann et . al .  , 2007 ) or to conceal certain 
aspects of the body ( Harden , Butler & Scheetz , 1998 )  . The psychology literature has also linked 
fashion to narcissism ( Larrain & Arrieta , 2007 )  , eating disorders ( Trautmann , Worthy & Lokken , 
2007 )  , over-dependence on others ’ approval ( Freeburg & Workman , 2016 )  , and loss of autonomy 
( Hardy , Merckelbach , Nijman & Zwets , 2007 )  . Studies have also found evidence to argue that 
unkept or eccentric clothing behaviour is associated with depression ( Dubler & Gurel , 1984 )  , 
linked to cognitive disorganization and a predisposition to develop psychotic symptoms ( Campo , 
FASHION AND POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY : INTERACTIONS BETWEEN CLOTHING , MOOD , 
SELF-CONCEPT , AND WELL-BEING
7
Nijman & Merckelbach , 2004 )  , and redundant clothing has been observable in patients with 
schizophrenia ( Andreasen , 1982 ; Arnold et al .  , 1993 )  . 
Despite the negative outlook of fashion in psychology , early psychological writings by Hall 
( 2003 [ 1898 ]  ) and Lotze ( 2003 [ 1887 ]  ) concur that fashion can evoke positivity through the daily 
rituals of choosing clothing and dressing up . They argue that these rituals arouse positive feelings 
of sensual and psychological comfort , and satisfaction that can contribute to enhancing one ’ s self 
concept . Horn ( 1968 ) extends these ideas by theorizing the associations between clothing and 
positive emotions to argue that clothing practices culminate in more positive perceptions of the 
self and higher levels of individual self-worth . In 1890 , William James ( Watson , 2004 ) argued that 
clothing was linked to well-being and presumed that clothing was an extension of the self-concept 
that could bring about psychological happiness . Clothing is regarded as a physical extension of the 
body and the clothing that one wears influences the perception that an individual has of themselves 
and their appearance ; perception of one ’ s appearance is an essential aspect in developing and 
maintaining the self-concept ( Stone , 1962 )  . Conversely , one ’ s understanding of self-concept can 
affect their clothing behaviour and influence their clothing selection and how they decide to project 
and display their appearance to the world ( Dubler & Gurel , 1984 ; Atkins , 1976 ; Ryan , 1952 )  . 
Clothing communicates our identities , influences the opinions of others , affects how we perceive 
ourselves , and shapes our attitudes and behaviours ( Fredrickson , Roberts , Noll , Quinn ,  & Twenge , 
1998 ; Zimbardo , 1969 )  . Raunio ’ s ( 1982 ) research is also in line with the former in observing that 
individuals select clothing to help them cope with daily social interactions and their own feelings , 
suggesting the regulative purposes of clothing to be used to control one ’ s environment and 
emotions . Goffman ( 2002 ) contends that the daily routines of dressing involve the organization 
and meticulous selection of clothing in order to deal with the dynamic and unstable circumstances

SELF-CONCEPT , AND WELL-BEING
8
that one encounters every day , a notion that can be supported by Bandura ’ s ( 1986 ) social cognitive 
theory . Bandura ’ s social cognitive theory argues that human functioning involves cognitive , 
vicarious , self-regulatory , and self-reflective processes in which individuals are self-organizing 
and proactive as opposed to being heavily influenced by their environment . There is a triadic 
reciprocity loop that encompasses personal factors , behaviour , and the environment . All three 
factors interact and influence how people observe and interpret situations and inform their 
decisions and subsequent behaviours . Individuals intentionally manage their identity through 
clothing by tuning in and actively considering their internal and external experiences and 
influences , such as their own emotions and the opinions of others . Through self-reflection and selfregulation , they respond to the triadic feedback loop and alter their behaviour or adjust their 
clothing to meet their internal and external needs , while self-curating their identity ( Bandura , 1986 ; 
Hall , 1996 )  . 
Although there is a small body of research claiming that the wearing of clothing can evoke 
feelings of happiness , these practices have largely been neglected by the field of positive 
psychology until very recently and there is only one published paper by Masuch and Hefferon 
( 2014 )  . These researchers from the UK conducted a pilot study to understand the links between 
positive psychology and fashion and , through a grounded theory analysis , identified clothing 
practices used by individuals to negotiate selfhood , befriend the body , and manage mood . A 
masters research study also conducted in the U . K . analyzed the subjective experience of wearing 
an ‘ outfit that makes you happy ’ and through interviews with men and women of various ages they 
learned how dress was used intentionally to manage identity and the active role dress played in the 
participants ’ well-being ( Smith , 2017b )  . Both of these studies provide the groundwork for how 
women experience clothing and inform the potential for using clothing to promote a positive self-

9
concept , mood , and hedonic and eudaimonic well-being . My research study builds on these ideas 
to gain a deeper understanding of how women interested in fashion experience clothing and how 
those experiences can positively interact and influence mood , self-concept , self-esteem , and wellbeing . With there being so few studies investigating these relationships from a positive psychology 
perspective , inquiry in this area is imperative and certainly justified . 
2 . 2 POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY AND WELL-BEING THEORY
There is a gap in the research on clothing and well-being with only two studies previously 
mentioned that have investigated these areas together ( Smith , 2017b ; Masuch & Hefferon , 2014 )  , 
and although it has received little attention , clothing is something we wear close to our bodies that 
can influence the way we think , feel , and behave , and it has the potential to contribute to our
positive well-being . Martin Seligman , former president of the American Psychological 
Association , recognized that psychology had consumed its research efforts towards understanding 
and finding cures for mental illness and he argued for a new positive psychology approach as one 
of his initiatives with the goal ‘ to utilize quality scientific research and scholarship to reorient 
[ psychological ] science and practice toward human strength ”  ( 1999 , p . 561 )  . Since World War II , 
psychology has focused on researching pathologies such as depression and learning how to repair 
the damage in the context of the disease model of human functioning ; however , positive 
psychology uses a preventative approach that aims to enhance the strengths of individuals and 
communities rather than repair their weaknesses ( Seligman & Csikszentmihalyi , 2000 )  . 
Psychology has prevailed in helping people live with and overcome mental illness ; however , the 
field of positive psychology can illuminate an understanding of how humans thrive and build 
positive qualities ( Seligman & Csikszentmihalyi , 2000 ; Gable & Haidt , 2005 )  . Seligman argues
that the negative aspect of psychology should be complemented by positive research emphasizing 
FASHION AND POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY : INTERACTIONS BETWEEN CLOTHING , MOOD , 
SELF-CONCEPT , AND WELL-BEING
10 
 “ the most positive qualities of an individual : optimism , courage , work ethic , future-mindedness , 
interpersonal skill… growth , mastery , drive , and character building ” and focus on “ what makes 
life most worth living ”  ( 1999 , pp . 560-562 )  . Positive psychology is about positive subjective 
experience and research in this field would determine “ what actions lead to well-being , positive 
individuals , to flourishing communities ” and “ make life better for all people-not just the mentally 
ill ”  ( 1999 , pp . 560-562 )  . Positive psychology is defined as ‘ the scientific study of optimal human 
functioning . It aims to discover and promote the factors that allow individuals and communities to 
thrive ’  ( Sheldon , Frederickson , Rathunde , Csikszentmihalyi ,  & Haidt , 2000 , Section 1 )  . Martin 
Seligman originally proposed three essential components of well-being or ‘ authentic happiness ’  : 
pleasure , engagement , and meaning ( 2002 )  , later he added two more components - relationships 
and accomplishments ( Forgeard et al . 2011 ; Seligman , 2011 )  . Seligman ’ s theory of well-being is 
now comprised of five elements which form the mnemonic PERMA : Positive emotion , 
Engagement , positive Relationships , Meaning , and Accomplishments ( Seligman , 2011 )  . The goal 
of positive psychology is flourishing , a combination of feeling good and functioning effectively 
with a high level of mental well-being ( Huppert , 2009a , b ; Keyes , 2002 ; Ryff & Singer 1998 )  . 
Positive psychology on the individual level focuses on building and enhancing the most positive 
qualities and traits such as capacity for love and vocation , optimism , courage , work-ethic , futuremindedness , interpersonal skills , aesthetic sensibility , originality , capacity for pleasure and insight , 
high talent , and perseverance ( Seligman , 2011 )  . I hypothesize that an individual ’ s mood and the 
cognitive and emotional appraisals of self-concept , interact with their clothing choices , how they 
experience wearing clothing , and can influence their self-esteem and well-being . Therefore , in this 
study I explored these relationships and interactions between clothing , mood , self-concept , selfesteem , and well-being using a sample of women interested in fashion . Due to the qualitative and 
FASHION AND POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY : INTERACTIONS BETWEEN CLOTHING , MOOD , 
SELF-CONCEPT , AND WELL-BEING
11
exploratory nature of this research I will be using the general theories of hedonic and eudaimonic 
well-being and along with my discussion I will explain how my results relate to PERMA . The 
construct of well-being is described as optimal psychological functioning and experience and the 
construct is differentiated between the overlapping paradigms of hedonic and eudaimonic wellbeing ( Ryan & Deci , 2001 )  . Hedonic well-being also referred to as subjective well-being , involves 
the immediate and momentary experiences of happiness or pleasure and avoidance of pain that 
exists across affective and cognitive dimensions . Affect is the experience of feeling or emotion 
and can be divided into positive affect ( PA ) and negative affect ( NA )  . The concept of hedonic 
well-being is focused on the individual ’ s own evaluations of their lives and describes experiences 
yielding high levels of positive affect , low levels of negative affect , and high levels of life 
satisfaction , or in general terms happiness ( Bradburn , 1969 ; Watson et al .  , 1988 ; Diener & Lucas , 
1999 )  . Eudaimonic well-being is distinct from happiness and momentary pleasure , it consists of 
more factors that contribute to personal growth and development , such as self-actualization , the 
realization or fulfillment of one ’ s talents or potential ( Ryff & Singer , 2008 )  , and also includes 
meaning making processes ( King et al .  , 2006 )  , living by one ’ s daimon or true self with experiences 
of authenticity ( Waterman , 2011 )  , and self-expressiveness ( Waterman , 1993 )  . Under the 
paradigms of hedonic and eudaimonic well-being , this research project investigates the 
experiences women have with their clothing and how those experiences interact with their selfconcept and well-being . 
2 . 3 SELF-CONCEPT AND SELF-ESTEEM 
There are many different definitions of self-concept depending on the research perspective . 
Carl Rogers ’ humanistic personality theory comprises the notion of self or self-concept , which he 
believed is formed by three components : self-image or real-self , self-esteem or self-worth , and 
FASHION AND POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY : INTERACTIONS BETWEEN CLOTHING , MOOD , 
SELF-CONCEPT , AND WELL-BEING
12
ideal-self ( 1959 )  . Self-image is how we perceive ourselves , including our body image , it has an 
influential role on our psychological well-being , and a direct impact on how an individual thinks , 
feels , and behaves ( Rogers , 1959 )  . Self-esteem or self-worth is the extent to which we accept or 
approve ourselves , and how much value an individual places on themselves ( Rogers , 1959 )  . When 
Rogers talks about the ideal , he suggests there is a gap between the real self and the ideal-self 
( Boeree , 2006 ) and the ideal-self represents our dynamic ambitions and goals that we strive for 
( Rogers , 1961 )  . Altogether , the ideal-self is all those things that we think we should be and that 
we feel others think we should be ( Rogers , 1961 )  . Rogers also believes that humans have “ one 
basic tendency and striving to actualize , maintain , and enhance the experiencing organism ”  ( 1951 ) 
to fulfill one ’ s potential and become a fully functioning person ( 1961 )  . The notion of the ideal-self 
suggests a connection to eudaimonic well-being and the concept of flourishing in positive 
psychology . George Herbert Mead points out that the term “ self ” is reflexive in its nature as it is 
used to describe oneself when the individual is standing on the outside looking in and describing , 
evaluating , or reflecting on oneself as an object ( Rosenberg , 1979 , p . 6 )  . Morris Rosenberg , author 
of Conceiving the Self and frequently cited in marketing and consumer behaviour research , 
describes the outside perspective of the self :  “ the self-concept is not the ‘ real self ’ but , rather , the 
picture of the self ”  ( Rosenberg , 1979 , p . 7 )  . Rosenberg defines the self-concept as “ the totality of 
the individual ’ s thoughts and feelings having reference to himself as an object ”  ( 1979 , p . 9 )  . More 
recent psychology literature on the self-concept refers to the self as being multidimensional with 
different possible selves that “ represent individuals ’ ideas of what they might become , what they 
would like to become , and what they are afraid of becoming , and thus provide a conceptual link 
between cognition and motivation ”  ( Markus & Nurius , 1986 , p . 1 )  . Possible selves are derived 
from past , present , and future experiences , and they are influenced by the sociocultural and 
FASHION AND POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY : INTERACTIONS BETWEEN CLOTHING , MOOD , 
SELF-CONCEPT , AND WELL-BEING
13
historical context the individual lives in and from the models , images , and symbols they encounter 
in their immediate social experiences and representations in the media ( Markus & Nurius , 1986 )  . 
Although possible selves are created and constructed by the individual , they are still socially 
determined and constrained ( Elder , 1980 ; Meyer , 1985 ; Stryker , 1984 )  . 
Presently , most theorists describe the self-concept as a complex dynamic phenomenon 
composed of different cognitive and emotional elements : 1 . actual-self ( defined as how people see 
themselves )  ; 2 . ideal-self ( defined as how people would like to see themselves )  ; 3 . actual-social 
self ( defined as how people believe they are seen by others )  ; 4 . ideal-social self ( defined as how 
people would like to be seen by others )  ( Swann Jr .  , Chang-Schneider ,  & McLarty , 2007 ; Sirgy , 
1997 ; Sirgy , 2000 )  . When people describe self-concept , they tend to view the self as a social 
exterior or psychological interior , the former being the overt or visible public persona such as the 
physical characteristics , social identity elements , behaviour , or the latter being the more concealed 
self that includes the individual ’ s private emotions , attitudes , and ambitions ( Rosenberg , 1979 , p . 
22 )  . Self-esteem is an attitude that is both a cognitive and emotional judgement an individual has 
towards himself that can be global or specific . These concepts are not identical or interchangeable , 
and they depend on whether the individual is looking at themselves as an object as a whole , or 
looking at the specific “ facets ” of themselves as an object ( Rosenberg , 1979 , p . 20 ; Swann Jr .  , 
Chang-Schneider ,  & McClarty , 2007 ; Marsh , 1990 )  . For example , a woman may have a generally 
positive attitude about herself as a whole but may have a different attitude towards certain parts of 
her body . Attitudes encompass both cognitive and affective components : the cognitive element 
refers to the object and the attitude represents the thought or idea about that particular object ; the 
latter affective element refers to the fact that attitudes can be positive or negative and range in the 
intensity level of the attitude ( Rosenberg , Schooler , Schoenbach , and Rosenberg , 1995 )  . A person

SELF-CONCEPT , AND WELL-BEING
14
with high self-esteem is not characterized as thinking they are superior over others or arrogant , 
rather it means the person has respect for themselves , recognizes their merits , realizes and 
acknowledges their faults , and considers themselves as a person of value and worth ( Rosenberg , 
1979 , p . 54 )  . A person with low self-esteem lacks self-respect , does not recognize their worth as a 
person , and considers themselves as inadequate or deficient as a person ( Rosenberg , 1979 , p . 54 )  . 
The self-esteem motive is a powerful and fundamental motive in human striving that influences 
individuals to act and present themselves in a certain way to the world in order to protect , satisfy , 
or enhance their self-esteem ( Rosenberg , 1979 , p . 57 )  . The self-consistency motive goes hand-inhand with the one of self-esteem as this motive describes how a person acts accordingly with their 
self-concept to maintain the image they have of their self ( Rosenberg , 1979 , p . 57 )  . Self-esteem 
and self-concept encompass the cognitive thoughts and affective feelings we have about ourselves 
and these form by observing and reading the reactions other people have towards us ( Cooley , 1902 ; 
Mead , 1934 )  , our own behaviour ( Bem , 1972 )  , and how others perform relative to us ( Festinger , 
1954 )  . Altogether , the views that we have of ourselves shape our experiences , give them meaning , 
and allow us to understand and form a reaction to such experiences ( Swann Jr .  , Chang-Schneider ,  
& McClarty , 2007 )  . We all seek to present ourselves in a certain way and theorists argue we do 
this to satisfy the self-esteem and self-consistency motives , to fulfill ends , goals or values , social 
approval and conformity to norms ( Rosenberg , 1979 , p . 47 )  . The way we present ourselves to the 
world in our clothing has a major influence on our implicit or explicit impression management 
( Goffman , 1956 )  . Erving Goffman ’ s work on clothing and appearance is mostly derived from his 
famous book The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life ( 1959 ) where he introduces his notion of 
self-presentation as a metaphor for the person being an actor in the theatre in his everyday life . 
When the individual enters a social setting , they are trying to portray a favourable image of 
FASHION AND POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY : INTERACTIONS BETWEEN CLOTHING , MOOD , 
SELF-CONCEPT , AND WELL-BEING
15
themselves to influence the situation by performing aspects of the self by using visual and material 
elements such as body language and clothing ( Tseëlon , 2016 )  . Goffman considers clothing to be 
an element involved in the personal front that impacts our presentation of the self and our social 
interactions ( Goffman , 1959 )  . Our moods and emotions interact with internal and external factors 
in the environment to influence our conception of self and inform the clothing we choose to wear . 
Tseёlon ’ s work explores the paradoxes of a woman ’ s appearance in society and her 
methods rely on Goffman and symbolic interaction to argue that clothing is a crucial part of how 
women present themselves as it gives them agency to create and perform their single or multiple 
identities to the world and their appearance contributes to their self-actualization ( 1995 )  . The 
author also questions the lack of empirical evidence exploring women ’ s relationships with clothing 
( 1995 ) and my research will explore how women experience the wearing of clothing and how it 
interacts with their self-concept and self-esteem . I believe that clothing is a crucial element 
involved in how we perform and represent our self-concept in front of others and behind closed 
doors , manage and enhance our self-esteem , and unify our ideas and beliefs about our own and 
others ’ self-concept . An individual ’ s appearance including grooming , makeup , and clothing , play 
an important role in how they express themselves as a person , it impacts their identity , their selfesteem , their perception of their self-concept , their social interactions , and the way they are feeling 
in the moment and over time . This study will look at the ‘ lived experiences ’ of women to 
understand their thoughts and feelings about how they see themselves and feel about themselves 
in their experience of choosing and wearing clothing in their daily life and will focus on the 
multiple dimensions of self-concept and self-esteem . I will be focusing on the components of the 
actual-self , ideal-self , actual-social self , and ideal-social self as well as the attitude of self-esteem . 
An individual ’ s perception of their self-concept and self-esteem will also interact with their 
FASHION AND POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY : INTERACTIONS BETWEEN CLOTHING , MOOD , 
SELF-CONCEPT , AND WELL-BEING
16
emotions and moods and this is another area that is expected to impact the individual ’ s behaviour 
and clothing practices . Body-image as a specific component of one ’ s self concept is also predicted 
to be a theme that influences women ’ s clothing practices in this study . 
2 . 4 DISTINCTION OF EMOTION AND MOOD 
Emotion and mood are important elements that are expected to influence the clothing 
choices and experiences of women . The terms emotion and mood are frequently used 
interchangeably in the literature , however the two represent distinct but similarly related 
phenomena . Mood refers to a maintained emotional state that can occur by no apparent cause 
( Brehm , 1999 )  , lasts longer than emotions , and as Davidson ( 1994 ) and others have argued , mood 
biases our cognitive and perceptual processes , more than it biases our behaviour ( Clore , 1994 ; 
Ruckmick , 1936 ; Whybrow , 1998 )  . Emotions bias our behaviour ( Davidson , 1994 )  , and tend to 
last for a shorter period of time compared to mood . Oatley and Jenkins ( 1992 ) argue that emotions 
can disrupt our priorities of goals and interfere with the flow of action , however moods maintain 
a ready state that persists even when disrupted . Whereas emotions are understood as highly ‘ objectfocused ’  , Russell and Feldman-Barrett posit that mood refers to “ free-floating affect… subject to 
many causes from specific events , such as the weather to diurnal cycles , some of which are beyond 
the human capacity to detect ”  ( 1999 , p . 806 )  . Emotion generally refers to a psychological state that 
occurs as the result of an external stimulus or a specific event and results in physiological arousal , 
subjective feelings , whose intensity , duration , and experience are dependent on the perception of 
the individual ( e . g . perception of happiness or sadness etc .  ) and the overt expression of emotion 
( e . g . verbal , body language , facial expressions )  ( Ekman , 1994 )  . Emotion has been difficult to 
define , however Scherer ( 1984 ) has found there is a growing consensus among emotion theorists 
that agree to describe emotion as a psychological construct consisting of several components : a )

SELF-CONCEPT , AND WELL-BEING
17
cognitive appraisal or evaluation of stimuli and situations , b ) physiological activation or arousal , 
c ) motor expression ( e . g . facial expression )  , d ) motivation for readiness of behaviour and intention 
of behaviour , e ) subjective feeling state response ( an individual ’ s perception to the situation and 
the subjective feelings they can describe )  ( Averill , 1980 ; Izard , 1977 ; Lazarus , Averill ,  & Opton , 
1970 ; Leventhal , 1979 ; Plutchik , 1980 )  . With the understanding that our mood can alter our 
thought processes and the way we perceive the world , and emotions can bias our actions and 
behaviours , I argue that different emotions and moods can influence what we decide to wear and 
how we experience that clothing . The ways in which emotion and mood influence our clothing 
choices and experiences with fashion and how clothing practices are used for emotional regulation 
have been highlighted as a topic in need of further qualitative inquiry . 
2 . 5 RESEARCH ON THE RELATIONSHIP OF CLOTHING AND THE SELF
Clothing can be a means to express positive emotions , used as a coping mechanism to deal 
with negative self-concepts ( Humphrey , Klaasen ,  & Creekmore , 1971 ; Worrell ; 1977 )  , to enhance 
one ’ s appearance ( Rudd & Lennon , 1994 )  , and in turn lead to higher self-satisfaction in wearing 
that clothing ( Markee , Carey ,  & Pederson , 1990 ) and a higher self-esteem . Raunio ( 1982 ) observes
that expressive features of clothing help to create a bond of togetherness with other people , make 
them stand out from the crowd , create an impression and control the feelings , perceptions , and 
impressions of other people . Other studies find that women who have a close relationship with 
fashion consider clothing as a means to express their creativity , personality , beliefs , enhance their 
attractiveness , and satisfy their social and emotional needs ( Sontag and Lee , 2004 )  . Clothing can 
be viewed as part of the self-concept and reflects the extent to which ‘ clothing was viewed as one 
with the self ’  ( Sontag & Schlater , 1982 , p . 5 ) and observes that individuals who regard clothing to 
be a crucial part of their self-construct strive to use dress in a way that is consistent with their self-
FASHION AND POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY : INTERACTIONS BETWEEN CLOTHING , MOOD , 
SELF-CONCEPT , AND WELL-BEING
18
image ( Sontag & Lee , 2004 )  , an argument which is supported by Rosenberg ’ s ( 1979 ) selfconsistency motive . Clothing in relation to self-construct may also reflect ‘ self-evaluative 
appearance investment ’ or in other words the value an individual places on their perception of how 
important their appearance is to their self-worth ( Tiggemann & Lacey , 2009 )  . It has been observed 
that as women get older , their sense of self-worth becomes more independent from their 
appearance ( Tiggemann and Lacey , 2009 )  . This may be due to other facets of their lives that 
become more important in defining their self-worth ( e . g . occupational identity , motherhood )  
( Tiggemann & Stevens , 1999 ) or contrarily , women develop strategies that help them cognitively 
to accept the process of ageing and their changing bodies ( Webster & Tiggemann , 2003 )  . Guy and 
Banim conducted a grounded theory qualitative study to understand the relationships women have 
with their clothing and found strong connections that affect three coexisting views of the self :  ‘ The 
woman I want to be ’  ,  ‘ The woman I fear I could be ’ and ‘ The woman I am most of the time ’  ( 2000 )  . 
This study revealed the ways in which women attempt to create satisfying images through their 
clothing by managing their identity ( Guy & Banim , 2000 )  . The observations of Guy and Banim 
( 2000 ) are in line with the work of Markus and Nurius and their notion of “ possible selves ” which 
represents individuals ’ ideals of what they might become , what they would like to become , and 
what they are afraid of becoming ”  ( 1986 , p . 954 )  . The representations of the self in the past that 
remain in the mind and continue to exist within the self-concept , along with representations of the 
self in the future , which consist of an individual ’ s hopes , fears , and fantasies , both form “ possible 
selves ”  ( Markus & Nurius , 1986 )  . Most theorists describe the self-concept as a complex dynamic 
phenomenon because the self-knowledge and set of self-conceptions that are present in the 
individual ’ s thoughts and memory are constantly shifting with different experiences , affective 
internal states , and social interactions ( Cantor & Kihlstrom , 1983 ; Epstein , 1973 ; Gergen , 1967 ; 
FASHION AND POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY : INTERACTIONS BETWEEN CLOTHING , MOOD , 
SELF-CONCEPT , AND WELL-BEING
19
Greenwald , 1980 ; Kelly , 1955 ; McGuire , 1984 ; Mead , 1934 ; Rosenberg , 1979 ; Tesser & 
Campbell , 1984 ; Turner , 1968 )  . Markus and Nurius ( 1986 ) argue that emotional affect , positive or 
negative , is produced by discrepancies or conflicts within the self-concept and this view is in line 
with earlier self-theorists ( Cooley , 1902 ; Freud , 1925 ; James , 1890 ; Sullivan , 1953 )  . There are 
clearly interactions between an individual ’ s emotions , moods , and self-concept , and because it has 
been argued that clothing is used as an impression management tool to alter mood , control a 
woman ’ s appearance , body-image , and identity , it is worth exploring how mood and ideas of the 
self interact with clothing practices . 
Clothing worn and experienced on the body can influence a change in one ’ s mood ( Moody , 
Kinderman & Sinha , 2010 ; Tiggermann & Lacey , 2009 ) and body image to make women feel 
good about themselves ( Cash , 1990 )  . The change in mood can be attributed to wearing a 
fashionable garment , one that conceals figure flaws , expresses one ’ s personality or identity , 
provides comfort , or boosts one ’ s confidence ( Kang et al .  , 2012 )  . Individuals that have an intimate 
relationship with clothing may use it to change their mood , for example by wearing a favourite 
garment to make themselves feel better when they wake up in a bad mood . Kwon and Parham 
( 1994 ) explored the clothing practices of women when they ‘ feel fat ’ or ‘ feel thin ’ and noticed 
fluctuations in their body image , confidence , and self-consciousness . When these women ‘ feel fat ’ 
they tend to use clothing for comfort and camouflage and when they ‘ feel thin ’ they are more 
confident to use clothing to express their individual style and dress fashionably ( Kwon & Parham , 
1994 )  . However , this study did not probe further to ask women how they used clothing to manage 
and cope with their emotional feelings or thoughts about their self-concept . Body-image is 
intimately linked to the self-image and self-esteem aspects of the self-concept and Kaiser ( 1990 ) 
argues that one ’ s perception of their body-image can evoke positive or negative emotions that will

SELF-CONCEPT , AND WELL-BEING
20
in turn influence the clothing they decide to wear , as demonstrated by the women in the previous 
study when they used clothing to camouflage certain undesirable aspects of their body . Frith and 
Gleeson ( 2008 ) carried out a qualitative study that exposed the behavioural strategies women 
implement to manage body image anxiety , in addition to the strategies used to ‘ show off ’ aspects 
of their body they are proud of ; being skilled at managing their appearance and knowing what 
 ‘ look ’ complements their body can allow for pride and a sense of mastery and autonomy over the 
body ( McKinley , 2002 ; Skeggs , 1997 )  . Social appearance anxiety ,  ‘ anxiety about being negatively 
evaluated by others because of one ’ s overall appearance ’  ( Hart et al .  , 2008 , p . 48 ) is another 
individual trait that can influence an individual to use their clothing as a means to alter their mood . 
Individuals that experience bad moods as a reaction to negative evaluations by others may use 
clothing to camouflage , conceal , provide comfort , or blend in to deal with or avoid these negative 
experiences ( Kang , Johnson ,  & Kim , 2012 )  . For my research I chose a sample of participants with 
an interest in fashion with the contention that these individuals would be more sensitive and selfreflective on the subject and experience of dress , with clothing having a greater influence on their 
personal appearance and self-concept . My research connects the ideas from these previous studies 
and delves deeper from the perspective of positive psychology to provide a comprehensive 
understanding of the interactions between clothing , mood , self-concept , and their influence on 
behaviour and potential for positive well-being .

21
To achieve a comprehensive understanding of the interactions between clothing , emotions 
and mood , self-concept , self-esteem and how the experience of dress impacts an individual ’ s 
behaviour and well-being , I have utilized a qualitative interpretative phenomenological analysis 
( IPA ) approach for my research project . IPA , developed within psychology , has an idiographic 
focus that will offer insights into the personal lived experiences women have with clothing and 
lends itself well to provide in-depth examinations of positive psychological phenomena ( Smith , 
1996 ; Smith , 2017a )  . This research was an active interpretative endeavor on my behalf as a 
researcher as I interpreted and produced the knowledge that sought to understand how the 
participants try to ‘ make sense of their world ’  ( Smith & Osborn , 2015 , p . 26 )  . This qualitative 
research project required a reflexive rendering of my role as a researcher role within the analytical 
and research process ( Hunter et al .  , 2011 )  . I acknowledge the reflexivity entailed in the IPA 
approach to prevent my interests and any bias that would skew the results of my research . The first 
part of the study involved an online socio-demographic information survey and a personal account 
questionnaire to gather primary data regarding the participants ’ thoughts and attitudes towards 
fashion and clothing . After completing the two surveys , participants then took part in a daily 
clothing diary where they were asked to record the clothing they wore , and the thoughts and 
feelings they had in the selection of that outfit and the experience wearing it . Participants were 
also asked to take photographs of their daily outfits to correspond with their diary responses , so 
they could be used in conversation for the subsequent wardrobe interview . After completing the 
daily diaries , the women took part in an in-depth semi-structured wardrobe interview . 
3 . 2 RESEARCH METHODOLOGY
3 . 2 . 1 Participants
FASHION AND POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY : INTERACTIONS BETWEEN CLOTHING , MOOD , 
SELF-CONCEPT , AND WELL-BEING
22
Seven participants that identify as women between the ages of 21 to 39 years old living in 
the cities of Toronto and Guelph were recruited through social media , email , posters , and in person 
( see Table 1 )  . The study invited women to participate that have an interest and engagement in 
fashion , clothing , and what they wear . Before participants signed up for this study they were asked 
to consider if they have the time , willingness , and commitment to participate in all aspects of this 
study , since the methods were extensive . One participant dropped out of the study after only 
completing the surveys , so the data collected from that participant was not be used in the analysis . 
It was very difficult to recruit participants and because of this , six out of seven women were friends 
or acquaintances of the researcher , so this may have produced some ethical issues . Brewis ( 2014 ) 
offers insights and important issues to consider about the ethics of researching friends for 
qualitative researchers . Similar to the experiences of Brewis ( 2014 ) and McConnell-Henry et al .  
( 2009-2010 , p . 3 )  , the frankness and in-depth responses from friends were a product of the existing 
friendships and this actually produced very rich data . The participants felt comfortable talking 
openly about their experiences with friend-researchers , perhaps more so than with strangerresearchers ( Brewis , 2014 )  . Similar to Haynes ( 2006 , p . 6 )  , one of my participants said the 
interview was like a ‘ therapy session ’ and that talking about her clothing practices gave her a 
different perspective and understanding of herself . In my analysis I ensured that I did not use any 
extant data from our friendships to enhance my research and I focused on the ‘ actual data ’ that I 
gathered throughout this project . There is also a balancing act when presenting research about your 
friends to honour the ‘ relational responsibilities ’ to them and present these respondents ’  ‘ lives in 
a complex and truthful way for readers ’  ( 2009 , p . 678 , citing Ellis , 2007 in part ; also see TillmannHealy , 2003 , p . 741 )  . In addition , due to the small sample size and the diverse array of individual

subjective experiences , this study faces limitations in that the results and conclusions of the 
research may not be generalized beyond the sample .

Table 1 : Participant Socio-demographic Table . 
3 . 2 . 2 Data Collection 
In addition to collecting contact and socio-demographic information in an online survey , 
participants were asked to complete a personal account questionnaire with six open-ended 
questions asking about their relationship with clothing and their thoughts , attitudes , and feelings 
towards fashion and clothing ( see Appendix A )  . The purpose of this questionnaire was to collect 
primary data to assess the relationships each participant has with clothing and to get to know some 
of their experiences with fashion . Next , the women were asked to complete a daily clothing dairy 
over four weeks with the parameters to record digitally written responses for 3-4 outfits per week 
( total of 12-16 entries over 4 weeks )  . Guy and Banim ( 2000 ) conducted their daily diary over two 
weeks ; however , I chose to extend the duration to four weeks to allow more time for recording and 
reflection . The daily diary also asked them to collect photographs of their daily outfits they chose 
FASHION AND POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY : INTERACTIONS BETWEEN CLOTHING , MOOD , 
SELF-CONCEPT , AND WELL-BEING
24
to wear to provide insight into their clothing style and connect their experiences , feelings , and 
thoughts about their self and behaviour , with the actual outfit they wore . All participants provided 
consent to use the photographs they took , and it was optional to include their faces in the photos . 
They were given options to block out their faces from the photos , crop them out , or the photos 
could have been taken of the clothing laid out on the floor or on a hanger . For the diary responses , 
the women were given a guideline of questions to be aware of and think about when they were 
reflecting on their experiences in those outfits . However , this was simply a guideline and 
participants were not forced to answer every single question on the list ( see Appendix C )  . The 
women were also asked to note any situations that occurred throughout their day that may have 
changed the way they felt about themselves in the clothing they were wearing . For example , they 
may have felt confident wearing the outfit they chose when they first put it on , but those feelings 
may have changed when a co-worker made a comment at work . It was very important for the 
women to have self-awareness in order to reflect , realize and note any significant fluctuations in 
their self-concept or self-esteem throughout the day to aid in the understanding of their 
experiences , feelings , and reactions with their clothing . Although the time period to complete the 
diaries and the number of entries recorded varied among participants , the responses they provided 
were sufficient for this research study and provided very valuable and insightful information . The 
purpose of the daily clothing diary was to initiate the women to start thinking more deeply about 
their experiences with clothing and reflect on how those experiences interact with their thoughts , 
feelings , behaviour and ideas about their self-concept . After participants completed and submitted
their diary entries , I conducted wardrobe interviews at their home and recorded and transcribed 
them verbatim . One of the participants moved to Ottawa , so the interview was conducted via 
FaceTime . The in-depth semi-structured wardrobe interviews took 20 to 40 minutes depending on 
FASHION AND POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY : INTERACTIONS BETWEEN CLOTHING , MOOD , 
SELF-CONCEPT , AND WELL-BEING
25
the participant and I drew my questions from a list that I had made prior and other questions flowed 
freely depending on the participant ’ s responses ( see Appendix D )  . The interview began by asking 
questions about their personal relationship with fashion and clothing , followed by questions asking 
them to reflect on how their mood , self-concept , self-esteem , confidence , and behaviour interacted 
with their experiences in the clothes they wore throughout the diary process . 
3 . 2 . 3 Data Analysis 
The socio-demographic survey and personal account questionnaire responses were 
organized in an Excel spreadsheet and participants ’ names were coded to ensure confidentiality . 
The interviews were transcribed and analyzed line-by-line to develop codes through a content 
analysis following the steps of decontextualization , recontextualization , categorization , and 
compilation ( Bengtsson , 2016 )  . Decontextualization involves identifying meaning units and 
labelling them with a code ( Bengtsson , 2016 )  . Recontextualization is the comparison of the 
original text with the meaning units to identify important information that relates to the aim of the 
study and excluding dross sentences ( Bengtsson , 2016 )  . Categorization involves condensing the 
meaning units by reducing the words without compromising the content of the unit and in this 
process categories and themes are identified ( Bengtsson , 2016 )  . The compilation step involves the 
analysis and write up the identified categories and themes and comparing the findings to the 
literature . In this phenomenological-based approach , the analysis focuses on how the participants 
make sense of their experiences with clothing and transforms those experiences into consciousness 
( Bengtsson , 2016 )  . The interview content and questionnaire were analyzed and content coded to 
identify themes and patterns among participants and organized further to isolate the main themes . 
The daily diaries were also analyzed to identify emerging themes regarding women ’ s experience 
with clothing . These analyses were then followed by a comparative analysis of the interviews and

SELF-CONCEPT , AND WELL-BEING
26
daily diary categories and themes to identify patterns in both contexts and summarize the main 
findings . 
CHAPTER 4
ANALYSIS
The content analysis of the interviews and daily diaries and subsequent comparative 
analysis led to the development of the overarching main category ‘ Selection and Experience of 
Clothing to Manage Everyday Well-being ’  . This core category of clothing to manage everyday 
well-being was attained by identification and synergy of the three following themes :  ‘ Manage 
Mood ’  ,  ‘ Clothing Strategies for Appearance Management ’  , and ‘ Reinforce and Validate Selfconcept ’  ( see figure 1 )  .

4 . 1 SELECTION AND EXPERIENCE OF CLOTHING TO MANAGE EVERYDAY 
WELL-BEING
4 . 1 . 1 Relationship with Fashion
Most of the women have a close and positive relationship with fashion and are interested 
in staying informed about what is in fashion and learning about new trends . Most of the women 
follow fashion on social media such as Instagram , Pinterest , magazines , online fashion sites , or in 
stores to feed their curiosity and inspiration for dressing . However , the women do not necessarily 
follow or buy into all of the trends because it is not economical to buy a new wardrobe every 
season and they find some trends weird . While reflecting on their diary entries , many of these 
women realized that they wear a lot of the same clothes and that they go through phases of 
repeatedly wearing the same garments and once they are done , they switch to something new . This 
realization justified the reasons to downsize their wardrobe and buy less . Some of the women enjoy 
experimenting with fashion to explore their identity , but some of the other women who are older 
do not experiment as much did when they were younger : 
I have a close relationship with fashion .  .  . When I ’ m doing nothing , I ’ m on my phone looking 
at pictures of fashion , always all the time . I ’ m always trying to find new trends .  ( P1 ) 
Basically when I was a kid I really liked really weird styles , anything that I would see , not 
just in a magazine , but in music videos and more experimental stuff… Magazines were 
probably my favourite area to follow , but then I also really loved just going to Value Village , 
I think I look up to a lot of rock stars and musicians and music videos and I think that was 
my biggest thing .  ( P2 ) 
FASHION AND POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY : INTERACTIONS BETWEEN CLOTHING , MOOD , 
SELF-CONCEPT , AND WELL-BEING
29
I ’ ve always had a very strong relationship , so there never was a point in my life where I 
didn ’ t know what the current trends were and things like that . So , I do follow trends , but I 
don ’ t necessarily buy what ’ s trendy I guess… And oh yeah , I definitely experiment but at 
37 , I feel like I ’ ve experimented so much that there ’ s no more experimenting left .  .  .  ( P3 ) 
As far as my relationship to what I wear , I find it ’ s very comfort based , like I have to feel 
comfortable , it has to go with my mood for sure… So as far as experimenting goes , that ’ s 
very important to me because I like the freshness , I like the idea of wearing a new outfit that 
I ’ ve never worn before .  ( P4 ) 
So firstly , I would describe my relationship as a lengthy one and an ever changing one . As 
for following trends I definitely keep up to date with them , but do I follow them ? No . I ’ m 
definitely more on the experimental side of exploring my personal identity which doesn ’ t 
necessarily click with what is happening in the mainstream .  ( P5 ) 
I think as I ’ ve gotten older I am less willing to experiment and I ’ m less willing to follow 
trends . I only want to wear what I like and also being a slave to fashion has not gotten me 
to where I want to be .  ( P6 ) 
Interested to a certain degree , I have a Pinterest board where I follow stuff and same with 
Instagram .  .  . I don ’ t necessarily follow the trends , because like I really didn ’ t when people 
were wearing corsets , I was like this is weird . So sometimes no , but I like to at least look at 
them .  ( P7 ) 
One woman ( P6 )  , after studying fashion at graduate level and starting a new business
venture , says she has a difficult relationship with fashion and dressing up is no longer a priority 
for her : 
FASHION AND POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY : INTERACTIONS BETWEEN CLOTHING , MOOD , 
SELF-CONCEPT , AND WELL-BEING
30
Lately , I ’ m only wearing jeans , sneakers , sweaters and sweatshirts . And that ’ s bad because 
I ’ ve been going on dates like that and that ’ s bad , because I have a whole wardrobe of 
clothes that I ’ ve been ignoring . So lately I ’ ve just been dressing like I don ’ t give a f *  *  *  . 
So , it ’ s not good .  .  . It feels like the least important thing to do on my list right now .  .  . It ’ s not 
a priority .  ( P6 ) 
Two of the women ( P4 & P6 ) in their thirties had more negative viewpoints about fashion 
trends and are opposed to being “ slaves to fashion ”  . Instead of following trends and dressing like 
everyone else , they want to wear clothes that they like , feel comfortable in , and look flattering on 
them , without exposing themselves too much : 
I ’ m not that interested in following trends at all , I do think there are certain trends that look 
good , but I find it almost embarrassing to be super trendy or look like you ’ re wearing the 
latest trend . It makes you look like a slave to fashion kind of… ( P4 ) 
I only want to wear what I like and also being a slave to fashion has not gotten me to where 
I want to be . The residual effects of the master ’ s program is that I resent dressing for the 
male gaze and spending my lion share income on makeup , and clothes and my 
appearance… It makes me feel a bit sad that I was such an unwitting participant in this 
patriarchal system of oppression ( P6 )  . 
4 . 1 . 2 Selection of Clothing 
Most of the women agreed that the most important factors influencing what they decide to 
wear on a daily basis are where they are going , what they are doing , and the weather . Many of 
these women will be out of the house most of the day , so they have to plan their outfit accordingly 
FASHION AND POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY : INTERACTIONS BETWEEN CLOTHING , MOOD , 
SELF-CONCEPT , AND WELL-BEING
31
by wearing versatile pieces that can transition from day to night . Another factor is function , 
especially the footwear for women that have to commute or will be on their feet most of the day . 
The practicality of their clothing was also important for the activity because to carry out physical 
activities or exercise for example , they need to wear more comfortable , breathable clothing , and 
the appropriate footwear : 
I think that ’ s a thing that I learned when I ’ m living in downtown Toronto is that generally 
when you leave your house for the day you ’ re going to a bunch of different places and 
you ’ re not going home until really late . So , you have to plan your outfit to go to multiple 
places .  ( P2 ) 
What I wear is something that can get me through the day without looking too fancy but 
can also bring me to the night and still look good or fancy if I end up going out , because 
that ’ s been happening a lot where I just kind of go out and the day just turns to night and I 
don ’ t have time to go home and change .  ( P4 ) 
So , in Toronto , number one is the weather and my winter wardrobe is seriously limited , 
and I don ’ t feel like investing in expensive winter pieces right now . So , I sort of start with 
what I have to wear to keep warm and then try and make it as unrepugnant as I possibly 
can from there .  ( P6 ) 
Some days obviously when I ’ m not feeling that good I don ’ t want to wear a crop top , like 
usually based on how I ’ m feeling comfort wise , because I think that sometimes an outfit 
looks really good , but I don ’ t feel comfortable or I don ’ t know , some days I ’ m not feeling 
it . Yeah usually comfort and where you ’ re going because a lot of the stuff I like to wear 
are not necessarily appropriate for every setting .  ( P7 ) 
FASHION AND POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY : INTERACTIONS BETWEEN CLOTHING , MOOD , 
SELF-CONCEPT , AND WELL-BEING
32
Other factors mentioned were the social setting they were in and the type of people they 
would be interacting with . When they go to work or school , there are social expectations of what 
clothing is appropriate and that also influences their clothing selections . Depending on the social 
situation , some women said they will cater their outfits to who they would be socializing with 
while still trying to dress to please themselves . For example , some women said they would wear 
more interesting or unique pieces with people that would understand what they were wearing and 
why they are wearing it . Oppositely , in other situations they may dress more neutral or conform to 
the style of the majority for people that are more conservative , do not have the same interest in 
fashion , or would not appreciate the outfit : 
Depends on the social situation I guess . If I ’ m out with a fashion savvy person , then I ’ ll 
definitely try to wear something that they would like . I think everyone does that . If I ’ m out 
with a friend that doesn ’ t care about fashion I definitely would choose something else . I ’ d 
probably choose something more neutral I guess . And same thing with my parents I ’ ll 
choose something more neutral , I don ’ t really wear crazy stuff around them because they 
probably won ’ t appreciate it , it ’ s kind of a waste of an outfit .  ( P3 ) 
Mood , positive or negative , and comfort were also deemed influential on style and clothing 
choice and these women describe some of the ways mood influences what they wear :  
.  .  . one is mood , it just depends if I ’ m in a foul mood . Yesterday for example I ’ ll just grab 
an oversized sweater and jeans , that ’ s like my foul mood outfit… Versus a day to day 
working from home , I don ’ t put that much thought into my everyday outfit I guess , and it 
very much depends on mood , like even between sweatpants and jeans , that ’ s like a mood 
scale .  ( P3 )  . 
FASHION AND POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY : INTERACTIONS BETWEEN CLOTHING , MOOD , 
SELF-CONCEPT , AND WELL-BEING
33
Because I had a bad week actually , I was really sad . I tried to make myself look good , not 
too good , because I could see the sadness , but I tried a little harder . Whereas if I ’ m really 
happy , I don ’ t necessarily try as hard and I think your beauty just shines through . When 
I ’ m sad I want to be comfortable , but I also want to look good .  ( P4 ) 
Another factor influencing their experience with clothing is the struggles women encounter 
when they are on their period and the limitations it imposes on their clothing choices because of 
bloating and mood swings : 
And I always have trouble dressing during my period because I ’ m one of those women that 
gains ten pounds of bloat and I definitely do not look forward to that . And recording those 
days , that was really tough because I feel like I can ’ t fit into anything , like everything is 
muffin top .  ( P3 ) 
The women ’ s life stage also played a role in their clothing selection with the time and effort 
they have to invest in their looks and the types of clothing they feel comfortable wearing . As they 
get older they want to dress more modestly and they don ’ t have as much time to experiment with 
their clothing : 
Before I used to experiment a lot . Since I have kids not anymore , because I don ’ t have the 
time . But yeah before I used to spend the whole morning just trying out things just to see 
how they look . But now I don ’ t have the time to do that , as much as I ’ d like to .  ( P1 ) 
I don ’ t really want to be projecting an image where I ’ ve got my boobs out and heels on 
where I feel like I ’ m deliberately trying to lure or get attention from men .  ( P6 )

SELF-CONCEPT , AND WELL-BEING

Altogether , the most important factors influencing what the women choose to wear on a 
daily basis are where they are going , what they are doing , and the weather . Secondary influences 
are the social situations they will encounter , comfort , mood , and style . 
4 . 1 . 3 Hedonic Well-being
Hedonic well-being also referred to as subjective well-being is defined as yielding high 
levels of positive affect , low levels of negative affect , high levels of life satisfaction , and happiness . 
Clothing in this sample provided most of the women with feelings of positive affect and the 
happiness they felt in their outfits was enhanced by compliments from others . Some women get 
dressed up for the day just to please themselves , even if they do not leave the house because it 
makes them feel good ; one women said that wearing heeled boots at home cheers her up and makes 
her feel more important , even though she is not going out to see anybody . Wearing a fresh new 
outfit , a favourite garment , colour , print , or a full character look also provided the women with 
feelings of happiness and change in mood , especially on a dreary day : 
After being just in pajamas I went out and got a little bit dressed up .  .  . it really felt good ! 
Like life was back ! Especially that I was wearing this sparkling parka that I think is very 
cool .  ( P1 ) 
I have pants that take off 10 pounds , they ’ re by Proenza Schouler and they ’ re the most 
perfect cut pants and if I was rich I would buy all of their pants and look skinny everyday . 
And they ’ re also bright blue and fun so I wear these a lot to events with heels , they fall 
really nicely and make the leg really long .  ( P3 ) 
On crappy days , in particular with makeup too , same with fashion , I would think well , 
because I feel crappy today for whatever reason I ’ m just going to over compensate and

SELF-CONCEPT , AND WELL-BEING
35
look amazing . Like I always say ,  “ feeling shitty looking pretty ”  .  .  . Now because people 
can register that I ’ m trying to present my best self , it ’ s starting to translate , so I ’ m kind of 
feeding off their energy from their perception of how I look .  ( P5 ) 
I have some black velvet jeans that I ’ m really loving at the moment . I have some black 
PVC pants that are super old , but I love them , and I always feel really good in them .  ( P6 ) 
The women also reported that they do not like wearing ratty or over worn clothes because 
it makes them feel tired and does not enhance their hedonic well-being . They said that by wearing 
clothing they like or clothes that have more structure , it can make them feel better and more 
motivated to complete their day to day tasks . In the morning before they got dressed , they started 
off feeling sloppy and after they put on their clothes for the day , they feel put together , fresh , and 
motivated to start their day : 
I don ’ t like wearing things that are too ratty or I don ’ t like wearing things that are old or 
tired and I think that really drags me down if I feel like I ’ m stuck wearing that sort of thing .  
( P6 ) 
I think it [ clothing ] has a huge influence in everything I do . Because even at home , I can ’ t 
do work in pajamas , I can ’ t take myself seriously . I need at least sweatpants to function as 
a human being day to day . When I ’ m well put together I ’ m just more confident in what I 
do… what is it , change your look change your life ? It ’ s kind of a cliché and psychiatrists 
would probably disagree but if your well put together and if you look good you ’ ll feel 
better during the day doing menial tasks . I think it ’ s a huge part of everyday dressing .  ( P3 ) 
FASHION AND POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY : INTERACTIONS BETWEEN CLOTHING , MOOD , 
SELF-CONCEPT , AND WELL-BEING

Like definitely mental well-being in the sense that sometimes you ’ re not feeling good and 
you get dressed in the morning and you ’ re like wow I look great… I ’ ll be having a bad 
day and then I go to the washroom and I ’ m like wow I look really good , and you feel 
better . That seems silly , but I really do think that it makes you feel better or happier for 
me… I think clothing enhances your well-being , like feel good , look good , I think that ’ s 
an actual thing .  ( P7 ) 
Although clothing could make them feel better , the women also reported feelings of low 
positive affect in their diaries when they were not feeling good or comfortable in their clothes 
because they did not fit properly , they did not like their clothes , the outfit didn ’ t look right , or suit 
the way they were feeling , what they were doing , or where they were going . During this study , one 
woman in particular was overworked , stressed , and tired and her interview and diary entries 
reflected those feelings and the fact that clothing was not a priority but simply being used to cover 
the body : 
Another terrible , tired-ass outfit . The long black cardigan was my grandmother ’ s and I ’ ve 
been wearing it for years . I ’ m sick of it but it ’ s warm ! I don ’ t think it goes well with blue 
jeans or the white tee shirt… Does it even matter what I look like at this point ? I ’ m so over 
worked and have so little time I don ’ t even really care what I ’ ve got on or what my hair 
and makeup is .  ( P6 ) 
A lot of my mental well-being translates to how stressed I am and therefore if I ’ m more 
stressed I have less mental energy to put into thinking about what I ’ m wearing . That lack 
of effort in my outfit is definitely apparent in my emotional and mental well-being .  ( P5 )  
( See figure 2 in Appendix E )

SELF-CONCEPT , AND WELL-BEING
37
Knowing what pieces of clothing you love and feel good in can increase positive affect , 
lead to positive changes in self-perception , feelings of satisfaction , and confidence that will be 
projected to the social spheres that one enters . 
I think that fashion has the power to greatly enhance it [ well-being ]  , your everything , 
whoever you are . It can elevate it because it is an extension [ of yourself ] and I think fashion 
can say things to other people that you have a hard time articulating yourself with words . 
In particular , how you feel . So , I think it ’ s a very important communicator so therefore if 
you can communicate well with fashion , it enhances your well-being . And then otherwise 
it can detract from your well-being if you don ’ t really know yourself , your style enough to 
express those parts of yourself . So not that it ’ s lowering it directly , but it ’ s not enhancing 
it either , it ’ s just sending these mixed messages of who you are or how you feel . But if you 
can hone in on that language of clothing , then it will definitely be beneficial so that you 
can be read as what you want to be read as by other people .  ( P5 ) 
4 . 1 . 4 Eudaimonic Well-being
Eudaimonic well-being encompasses factors that contribute to personal growth and 
development , self-actualization , meaning-making processes , experiences of authenticity , and selfexpressiveness . The eudaimonic dimension was reflected in the women ’ s clothing that symbolizes 
personal histories and achievements : 
I wore this to every internship job interview and I got every single one when I wore this 
dress . I have honestly rocked every single function I went to in this dress , so this is now 
my new go to and I can ’ t let the original one go because it ’ s my good luck charm , the 
FASHION AND POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY : INTERACTIONS BETWEEN CLOTHING , MOOD , 
SELF-CONCEPT , AND WELL-BEING
38
original dress that has shaped who I am in my career… These dresses really enhance my 
self-esteem because they remind me of my career success .  ( P5 ) 
Many of the women also shared their nostalgic relationships to certain pieces of clothing that 
remind them of their family , childhood , passions , past experiences , and relationships . When they 
wear these sentimental pieces , not only does it make them feel good , it also communicates and 
strengthens aspects of their self-concept such as their identity , values , political attitudes , and 
interests : 
My half-blind grandmother picked these pants out for me , and I love her taste so much , I 
always feel amazing wearing things associated to her . I feel really good in this outfit .  ( P4 )  
( See figure 3 in Appendix E ) 
I really like this look . I am wearing a “ POWERBOMB ” shirt . The band and the tee are 
inspired by their love for wrestling . I think I really like them because I really loved WWE 
growing up and loved female pro wrestlers , so it comes full circle when you ’ re kind of a 
punk girl rocking out to a wrestling inspired power violence band in the back room of a 
record shop as an adult on a Saturday night .  ( P2 )  ( See figure 4 in Appendix E ) 
I like this black jacket with Mexican embroidery a lot and I also like it because my mom 
has the same one . We bought it together .  .  . It was just a plain black jacket before and I 
sewed these Mexican textiles onto the back and when I went to Mexico in December she 
saw it and was like ,  “ Oh my god I love it !  ”  . So now she ’ s doing the same thing .  ( P1 )  ( See 
figure 5 in Appendix E ) 
FASHION AND POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY : INTERACTIONS BETWEEN CLOTHING , MOOD , 
SELF-CONCEPT , AND WELL-BEING
39
These women treasure and hold onto sentimental pieces of clothing that have subjectively 
perceived meanings or memories that remind them of their past experiences , relationships , and 
past selves , which also provides positive feelings that act to strengthen their self-concept . 
4 . 2 MANAGE MOOD
4 . 2 . 1 Clothing Increases Positive Affect
All of the women agreed that clothing can uplift their mood , whether that is through buying
a new dress , wearing a favourite garment , or getting all dressed up to go out . Clothing can make 
them feel empowered , creative , confident , and authentic as it is an extension of themselves and 
their body . Most of the women try to use clothing as a positive means to influence and uplift their 
mood , make themselves feel better emotionally , and feel more confident . They choose to wear 
clothing they like and know will make them feel good and boost their mood . The clothing diaries 
inspired them to enjoy getting dressed up , have fun with clothes , and be creative : 
Altogether , as a look , that ’ s my happiness . When I have the wig , the shoes , the nails , the 
accessories and the clothing , and it all comes together to look like one whole character .  .  . 
it makes me feel a lot better . There ’ s this emotional happiness to it . But generally , I think 
that clothing makes me happy and it ’ s always had this magical aspect to it . It ’ s fun to wear , 
it transforms my whole appearance , and I can basically be anyone I want to be when I put 
on clothing… I think that clothing just becomes this playground where I can be who I want 
to be .  ( P2 )  ( See figure 6 in Appendix E ) 
I feel good , and excited to be alive… I love this outfit… I feel like it suits my mood 
perfectly and it looks awesome . The colours make me feel really good , like a mermaid or 
something and I feel like it ' s a new look for me , so I ' m really stoked about it… I feel more 
FASHION AND POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY : INTERACTIONS BETWEEN CLOTHING , MOOD , 
SELF-CONCEPT , AND WELL-BEING
40
inspired about dressing and thinking about who I am , what I want to be , and what I aspire 
to . I like that question , what would be your ideal self .  .  . I never thought about it .  ( P4 ) 
Furthermore , through these self-reflective diaries the women were able to recognize the 
interactions between their different emotions and moods and their clothing choices . One woman 
says she uses her clothing and accessories as a coping strategy to experiment and deal with the 
different emotions she is feeling and the issues she is facing right now in her life :  
.  .  . I was wearing my ex boyfriend ’ s rings who I have very mixed feelings for with my 
grandmother ’ s jacket who I love so much . I was just thinking about combining all these 
emotions , like a combination of emotions on your body and working through them with 
what I ’ m wearing .  ( P4 ) 
These women also found value in becoming more self-aware and attentive to their feelings 
in their clothing . They became more in tune with how they felt before getting dressed , realized 
why they chose the clothes they wore , and how wearing those clothes impacted the way they felt : 
I think I really liked that I became more in tune with what I was doing when I was wearing 
it . I realized that I really do look dressed up when I go out dressed up . And I guess I kind 
of wondered why that was but then I kind of realized it takes a lot of effort to put a lot of 
those looks together… It would take a lot more decision making and time to pick a wig , 
put on all this makeup , put on the shoes .  .  .  ( P2 ) 
But I find doing this helped me get back into doing it more and have more fun and think 
more about my outfit and be more creative . Whereas before I would just put anything on . I 
FASHION AND POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY : INTERACTIONS BETWEEN CLOTHING , MOOD , 
SELF-CONCEPT , AND WELL-BEING
41
wasn ’ t really dressing for this , but I was thinking oh that would look cool or interesting to 
photograph . So , it ’ s helped me actually enjoy dressing up .  ( P4 ) 
I was reading over the entries and I saw different trends of this is how I felt today and then 
I saw the connection from how I went to bed feeling to what I wore the next day when I 
woke up .  ( P5 ) 
My relationship with fashion is so close and so personal so I always feel like if I wear 
something that ’ s so uncomfortable , it ruins my day . And I ’ m always very self-critical of 
what something looks like on me . When I was taking photos in the mirror I was like I don ’ t 
look too fat , like it ’ s okay . But it ’ s something that I think about everyday whether I ’ m 
recording it or not .  ( P2 ) 
Emotions can also have a negative effect on how much effort they put into dressing and in turn 
affect how these women feel in their clothing : 
So , my emotions impact my choice in clothing in terms of literally how much effort I ’ m 
going to put in . If I ’ m feeling tired or stressed or whatever clothes become the last thing 
I ’ m going to care about . And equally if I feel like I ’ ve got something wrong , even if my 
outfit is very simple and boring , if I feel like my sneakers don ’ t match , my t-shirt or my 
jacket , that ’ ll make me feel really off and awful all-day long .  ( P6 ) 
By keeping a daily clothing diary , the women realized the positive effect clothing can have 
on their emotions and mood , they found value in becoming more cognizant about their clothing 
practices and became aware of how what they wear interacts with their positive and negative 
emotions .

4 . 2 . 2 Cold Weather Increases Negative Affect
This study was conducted over the winter months and the diaries frequently revealed 
mentions of the cold and its influence on their mood , clothing choice , and well-being . These 
women described a negative change in their mood from the summer to winter months . They 
reported foul moods and low positive affect during these colder months due to the lack of daytime 
sunlight , the cold , and the struggle they experienced dressing for the cold weather outside . They 
were limited with the clothing they could wear , and some women reported feeling sad and more 
depressed during the colder months , suggesting the negative effect it has on their mental health . 
More negative emotions were said to hold the women back from dressing up and they noticed that 
when they did dress up to please themselves they felt a lot better , felt like leaving the house , and 
felt more like socializing . They felt that there was an emotional difference between not dressing 
up and dressing up . When they were cold , tired , moody , or sick , looking fabulous was not always 
a priority and clothing was simply used to cover the body and provide comfort : 
I ’ m so stressed out these days , this is about the extent of the creativity I can muster with 
my wardrobe . I just got this sweater , but I don ’ t love it ! I ’ m so tired , my hair looks like 
crap , clothes today are just a way for me to cover my body before I leave the house !  ( P6 )  
( See figure 7 in Appendix E ) 
Keeping a daily clothing diary was a valuable experience for these women as they became more 
aware about their feelings in their clothing and how their mood and the weather influences what 
they decide to wear . They began to realize why they wore the clothing they did wear and how they 
felt wearing it . It was also interesting to hear how one of the women felt much better when she 
went on vacation to a warmer climate in the middle of winter : 
FASHION AND POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY : INTERACTIONS BETWEEN CLOTHING , MOOD ,

43
Well , the last third of the pictures I took in Thailand , I ’ m visibly happier , tangibly happier 
the less I ’ m wearing . When I don ’ t have to think about 14 different elements to put 
together a look , I ’ m much happier .  ( P6 )  ( See figure 8 in Appendix E ) 
4 . 3 CLOTHING STRATEGIES FOR APPEARANCE MANAGEMENT
The interviews and diaries also revealed clothing strategies that the women employed to 
manage their appearances . When the women complained of feeling fat , bloated , or not looking 
their best , they use oversized clothing to camouflage and conceal their body , most commonly they 
tried to hide their stomach , butt , and hair . Some of the women also said they like to dress modestly 
to avoid being sexually objectified by the male gaze . It was interesting to learn that the women 
actually like wearing oversized clothing or accessories that conceal parts of their body : 
I got my period earlier in the day and was in a crazy amount of pain , and I had considerable 
period bloat . I felt fat , so I had to wear something concealing . In general , I love oversized 
clothing . I love when the body is concealed and the way fabric drapes , so it ’ s a good excuse 
to wear that silhouette . Overall , I loved this outfit .  ( P3 ) 
I love oversized clothes because they hide my body , I find the clothes become more about 
the clothes , and less about the body , and I kind of like that .  ( P4 ) 
I was actually having really bad hair day , spent about 25 minutes trying to fix my hair , 
before realizing that this hat worked with my sporty look and actually looked pretty cute .  
( P7 )  ( See figure 9 in Appendix E ) 
FASHION AND POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY : INTERACTIONS BETWEEN CLOTHING , MOOD , 
SELF-CONCEPT , AND WELL-BEING
44
The women also used clothing as a behavioural strategy to show off their best features and parts 
of their body they felt proud of . Wearing clothing that accentuated these features made themselves 
feel good , gave them feelings of pride , and boosted their confidence : 
I had a really bad week , but I ’ m starting to feel a little better… I wanted to dress up a bit 
and it was a warm choice… I love it because I feel good in it and it shows off my slim 
waist… A few people actually told me how stylish and beautiful I was .  ( P4 )  ( See figure 10
in Appendix E ) 
Well if I get it [ outfit ] right , it makes me feel good . I think for me the most important thing 
when I get dressed is how does my body look because that ’ s one of my best assets .  ( P6 ) 
I chose a cropped sweater because I had a really good workout yesterday and was definitely 
feeling my stomach today . I like wearing cropped tops when I ’ m feeling especially good 
about myself because it gives me an extra boost and I feel proud and happy that I ’ m not 
insecure baring my midriff .  ( P7 )  ( See figure 9 in Appendix E ) 
It was also found that one of the women ( P3 ) who works in the fashion industry , places 
great importance in managing her appearance and presenting herself in a certain way as a 
fashionable person on social media and in person when she goes out to fashion events . Posting 
well thought out photos of her fashionable outfits on social media outlets like Instagram reinforces 
her self-concept about who she is as an individual and professional and the comments and 
messages she receives complimenting her looks validates her clothing choices . She uses clothing 
to manage her appearance and the impressions of others by investing time , money , effort , and 
thought into putting together outfits for occasions where her appearance matters : 
FASHION AND POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY : INTERACTIONS BETWEEN CLOTHING , MOOD , 
SELF-CONCEPT , AND WELL-BEING

I was invited to an Hermes holiday cocktail party… It ’ s an important fashion networking 
event so I definitely had to look nice . I opted for a foulard print silk pyjama suit which was 
definitely going to stand out in a sea of black dresses so common at holiday events . I put 
on a blazer to make the outfit a bit more formal . The CEO complimented my suit and told 
me she had the same one . The event photographer took a couple of pics ( again , always a 
good sign !  )  . I posted a casual snap on my Instagram stories and several people messaged 
that they liked the outfit . I felt it was a good , smart choice for the event and I felt very 
confident and comfortable .  ( P3 )  ( See figure 11 in Appendix E ) 
What one wears also impacts their social interactions because clothing can influence one ’ s 
mood and confidence to initiate and sustain social interactions . Therefore , the clothing one wears 
can determine how other people will perceive and react to them . One of the women describes how 
she uses clothing as a strategy to mediate her social interactions : 
If I go out in a t-shirt and jeans and don ’ t put on my makeup or a wig on or anything , no 
one talks to me and it ’ s great . That ’ s the whole plan . Then when I go out with wigs and 
makeup and outfits I ’ m almost excited for people to talk to me . And that generally happens 
a lot too when someone points out a wig or a hat so I think I ’ m more social when I ’ m 
dressed up and less social when I ’ m dressed down . And that ’ s kind of how I mediate people 
talking to me .  ( P2 ) 
When I visit my family , like go home for the holidays , like most recently this past 
Christmas , I have to dress down my appearance , not make it less casual but make it less 
edgy , like less city I guess you could say .  .  . I don ’ t always want to be typecast as the “ weird 
Asian girl ” in the family , which I already have been . But , for my own sake I don ’ t want to 
FASHION AND POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY : INTERACTIONS BETWEEN CLOTHING , MOOD , 
SELF-CONCEPT , AND WELL-BEING
46
have that conversation every time because of what I ’ m wearing . So , I feel I police myself 
very heavily when I dress around my family .  ( P5 ) 
Using clothing to conceal the body or on the contrary to show off features of the body they are 
proud of , are strategies that these women use every day to feel better about themselves and help 
them manage their appearances and social interactions out in the world . 
4 . 4 REINFORCE AND VALIDATE SELF-CONCEPT
4 . 4 . 1 Actual-self , Ideal-self and Social-Self
These women use clothing as a means to project satisfying images of themselves , portray 
their ideal-selves to the different social spheres they occupy , and to explore different possible 
selves . The clothing they wore differed depending on whether they were dressing for their actualself versus their ideal-self and what activity or who they were dressing for . For example , if they 
were in a private place like their home , or running errands on the weekend , or in a comfortable 
social space , they would not go to great efforts to create an outfit , but instead would wear 
something easy and casual , representing their actual-selves . 
… if I ’ m just here working which that happens 2-3 times a week , honestly , I just grab jeans 
and a sweater if it ’ s cold , now that it ’ s winter . If it ’ s cold , I just grab something warm and 
that ’ s it .  ( P1 ) 
I think probably part of the reason I was so dressed down when I was doing the study was 
because I didn ’ t have anything going on where it was particularly important for people to 
see me in a different way . But I know if I wanted to start projecting a more professional 
image at my start up , then yeah , it ’ s probably time .  ( P6 ) 
FASHION AND POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY : INTERACTIONS BETWEEN CLOTHING , MOOD , 
SELF-CONCEPT , AND WELL-BEING
47
In these instances , they did not really care about how people perceived them in their clothing 
because they were dressing for comfort and their actual-self , the way they see their true self , and 
not looking to impress anyone . In other social spaces , such as school , work , or an event , six out of 
the seven women were influenced by their ideal-self and ideal-social self . Therefore , they were 
more likely to dress their best depending on the situation and wear clothing with the intention of 
portraying a desirable image of themselves . They would consider where they were going , what 
they would be doing , the people they would be interacting with , and how they wanted to be 
perceived by those people :  
.  .  . Whenever I go shopping , if I really want to enjoy myself shopping , I have to wear 
something nice , because if I ’ m not , I don ’ t even feel like trying anything on . You ’ re not 
feeling good about yourself , so how are you going to buy something if you aren ’ t feeling 
pretty or whatever .  ( P1 ) 
Well I was always shoot for the ideal self because you try and project that and that ’ s what 
other people see I guess . Like dress for the job you want or the job you have . I don ’ t really 
think about how I actually look like .  ( P3 ) 
Let ’ s say I have a 100% day that feels amazing , I feel happy and confident… I have my 
favourite playlist on , I ’ m walking so passionately to school and I have an image from third 
person of what I look like and think they must be like ,  “ Damn , that girl looks awesome ”  . 
So that ’ s what I think about a lot is how people , just passerby ’ s might perceive me… . Like 
how do strangers so me and how they picture my personality , or what my life would be 
like . Because if they can create a somewhat accurate picture or exaggeration of who I am , 
then I feel I ’ ve done myself justice .  ( P5 )  ( See figure 12 in Appendix E ) 
FASHION AND POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY : INTERACTIONS BETWEEN CLOTHING , MOOD , 
SELF-CONCEPT , AND WELL-BEING
48
These women , if they were not already hyper-aware of what they looked like in their 
clothing , became more cognizant about their appearances over the duration of the study , how they 
would be perceived by others in their clothing , and were motivated to present their ideal-self to 
the world . In their mind they have an ideal image of how they want to see themselves from the 
outside perspective and how they want other people to perceive them . These women use clothing 
to maintain and present their ideal image in public spaces so that others perceive them the way 
they want them to be perceived and as a result they receive feedback and compliments to reinforce 
their self-concept : 
Now because people can register that I ’ m trying to present my best self , it ’ s starting to 
translate , so I ’ m kind of feeding off their energy from their perception of how I look .  ( P5 ) 
Some women said that they dress for themselves , but others were more direct to admit that they 
dress for others and there seems to be an underlying unconscious bias to wear clothing to present 
their ideal-self and ideal-social self to the world : 
Yeah , I guess of course the things I choose to wear depend on how I want people to see me 
I guess . I ’ m going to be wearing whatever depending on where I ’ m going or who I ’ m going 
to see . Like in a couple of my entries I wrote about when go out with my husband and his 
colleagues . I ’ m always very self-aware because they ’ re super straight and sometimes if I 
wear something different , they always have comments sometimes good , sometimes they ’ re 
bad . Yeah , they always look you up and down and look at you weird . And sometimes they 
don ’ t need to say anything it ’ s just the way they look at you… ( P1 )  ( See figure 13 in 
Appendix E ) 
FASHION AND POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY : INTERACTIONS BETWEEN CLOTHING , MOOD , 
SELF-CONCEPT , AND WELL-BEING
49
Yeah , I definitely dress for other people . Like I think about what people expect me to look 
like and I try and not disappoint them , which is probably the wrong way to look at it , 
because you people are like I dress for me . But who really does that ?  ( P3 ) 
One of the woman ( P3 ) frequently mentioned that her image is especially important for her 
career in fashion because what she wears to events can help her with networking and future job 
opportunities , therefore the clothing she selects to wear for different eventsis a meticulous creative 
process because not only does she have to ensure that she projects an ideal-image for the job that 
she wants , but she also has to dress to please her future employers and stand out against the crowd : 
I have been struggling with what to wear for this epic party for days . I wanted something 
that pops in the crowd , so a lot of my black dresses were out of the question . I didn ’ t want 
to wear anything overtly trendy ( like body con or nightgown style dress )  . I loved the look 
on my skin tone , paired with a bright red lipstick . I wanted to add some height since the 
dress silhouette is quite voluminous , so I reached for my highest 5 ” heels by Alaia . The 
designer had passed away recently , so I thought it would be a nice tribute as well… All the 
official event photographers asked me to pose for pictures - which is good for press 
coverage .  ( P3 ) 
Clothing was also used to express different possible versions of the self , including the 
women they are most of the time , the women they want to be , and the woman they fear of 
becoming . Some of the women wear different clothing depending on which version of the self they 
want to present that day : 
I think this is another hat I wear , which is nerdy academic , school loving person . I think 
people who know me , know me for the different characters I play , that people at school 
FASHION AND POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY : INTERACTIONS BETWEEN CLOTHING , MOOD , 
SELF-CONCEPT , AND WELL-BEING
50
know me as an academic student , and kind of queer and weird , while at bars in my punk 
looks , I blend in with a crowd of fans , and while I kind of go back and forth between 
professional and punk I try really hard to take from both sides to inspire my fashion and 
looks .  ( P2 ) 
This same woman also discussed the conflicts she experiences in selecting her clothing , hair and 
makeup . She may want to pursue a career in academia , but her self-concept struggles with what 
she should wear in professional settings , such as an interview or the classroom , because she worries 
how people will judge her individual clothing style , makeup , and wigs and how it would be 
perceived as lacking professionalism . She resolves these discrepancies within her self-concept by 
compartmentalizing her clothing choices to her different possible selves , while still trying to stay 
true to her actual-self in some way , in order to manage the impressions of others . 
Another woman that is working hard on starting her own business has made clothing 
practices less of a priority and her negative and less than optimistic interview and clothing diary 
presented some thought provoking opinions . She was visibly tired , stressed , and overworked and 
her thoughts about her clothing choices reflected those feelings and the dissatisfaction that she felt 
with her clothing choices . Unlike some of the other women , she is not dressing to project her idealself , even though she used to really care about fashion and used to want to be fashionable . She 
grew up very passionate about fashion and there appears to be unresolved issues with herself and 
a disconnect between not prioritizing her dress to reflect the person she wants to become for her 
new entrepreneurial venture : 
Well I find Toronto hard because it ’ s not the most fashionable city , whatever people say , 
it ’ s not , compared to London or New York . I don ’ t walk around and see a lot of fashionable

SELF-CONCEPT , AND WELL-BEING
51
people , therefore I don ’ t feel like I have to keep up . Like in London for example , even 
though it ’ s kind of a dressed down city , people put a lot more effort into their clothes . I 
don ’ t feel like there ’ s any reason to put any effort in… Maybe the fact that I was just 
wearing t-shirts and jeans , maybe that was what made me feel run down and haggard . 
Maybe if I put more effort into what I was wearing , then maybe that would change my selfconcept… Ideal self is definitely the more fashion forward stuff that just , I don ’ t know , I 
just don ’ t feel comfortable in right now .  ( P6 ) 
Most of these women sought to present their ideal-self to the people they interacted with , 
they used clothing to maintain that ideal image of themselves , whether they dressed for themselves 
or others , and they used their clothing to present different aspects of their possible selves to manage 
their image and perceptions of others . There are clearly bi-directional influences between clothing , 
feelings about the self-concept , and attitudes , which in turn impact clothing choices and behaviour . 
4 . 4 . 2 Confidence and Self-Esteem
Throughout the process of reflecting and recording their daily outfits in their diaries , these 
women realized the positive influence clothing had on their confidence and self-esteem . They 
learned that taking time to reflect on the clothing they were wearing , seeing themselves in the 
mirror , and taking a picture of their outfit gave them an ego boost . These reflections made them 
feel more confident on days they were already satisfied with their outfit , but also on days when 
they were feeling unsure about themselves or how they looked : 
That was one of the things about writing what I was wearing , it was kind of like an ego 
boost before I went to school or work . I ’ d be like “ Oh I actually look really good , I like 
FASHION AND POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY : INTERACTIONS BETWEEN CLOTHING , MOOD , 
SELF-CONCEPT , AND WELL-BEING
52
this , this fits me really well . So I think that has to do with self-esteem but also there are 
days when I don ’ t look good and that ’ s fine .  ( P7 ) 
Receiving compliments on their outfits contributed to this ego boost as it gave them feelings of 
pride , validation and a sense of mastery about their clothing choice , and it enhanced their 
confidence and self-esteem . Not being able to accept compliments also says something about how 
they feel about themselves and their clothing : 
To me , it can make or break a day if someone gives you random little compliments , even 
if it ’ s small . It will boost how I feel and validate how I feel about , going out , and how I 
feel about dressing up . It confirms that I did something right , that I made a good decision 
with wearing these clothes and doing this makeup .  ( P2 ) 
… if you give someone a compliment and they shoot it down , it kind of shows that they ’ re 
not happy about what they ’ re wearing and then their compliment is getting rejected and 
then they ’ re put off by you rejecting their compliment when they ’ re trying to be nice . I 
think once I became more confident about how things look and what I was wearing , then 
the world just became a better place . I was nicer towards other people , I have learned to 
accept compliments which is great , and I feel more confident in what I ’ m wearing and that 
in turn has made me more confident about everything .  ( P2 ) 
All of the women agreed that wearing certain clothing can make them feel really good 
about themselves and enhance their confidence . During the study , the women became very 
attentive to how they were feeling physically and emotionally in their clothing and they all agreed 
that they felt their best and their most confident when they liked what they are wearing , the clothes 
fit properly on their body ’ s , and they liked the fit . They also agreed that wearing clothing that

SELF-CONCEPT , AND WELL-BEING
53
made them feel put together enhanced their confidence and self-esteem , as opposed to wearing 
clothes that were sloppy , ratty , or made them feel self-conscious : 
Sometimes when something is new and you ’ re just wearing it and it doesn ’ t feel good 
you ’ re self-conscious or trying to hide something . So normally if I have something and I 
want to feel confident in myself I will wear an outfit that I have worn before , so I already 
know how it feels and exactly how it looks… I know what ’ s going to happen when I move , 
I know how it ’ s going to look when I sit down so I feel completely confident about it .  ( P1 ) 
Accepting themselves and their body also plays a role in how they feel in their clothes . 
Depending on how they perceive themselves and how comfortable they are in their own body can 
have a positive or negative impact on the way they experience clothing : 
I think that finally I ’ ve come to terms with what size I am . So , becoming happy about that 
has made me happy about all the clothing I wear because if it fits and is comfortable it 
makes me more confident about wearing it and then in turn I feel really good about myself 
because I feel comfortable and I feel confident and I also feel like I look like I ’ m wearing 
clothing that fits . I think that two , becoming more okay with the fact that I ’ m not anyone 
else , and not comparing myself to other people was a big step .  ( P2 ) 
The women agreed that the look good feel good phenomenon is true and that the opposite 
is true as well because when they did not like what they were wearing or did not look their best in 
their opinion , they did not feel as comfortable or confident in their clothes : 
Yeah that ’ s why I want to look good is because of my self-esteem . I want to feel good 
about myself , I want to feel like I look good , and I like my outfit . That ’ s why I do it , it ’ s 
for my self-esteem… I think it [ clothing ] has such an ability to build confidence and have 
FASHION AND POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY : INTERACTIONS BETWEEN CLOTHING , MOOD , 
SELF-CONCEPT , AND WELL-BEING
54
you be confident and comfortable and I think that ’ s a major part of your well-being . And 
happiness is just feeling good about yourself and looking good .  ( P4 ) 
Yeah when you ’ re wearing something that you like or feel that looks good or is 
comfortable , I feel like you feel so much better .  ( P7 )  ( See figure 14 in Appendix E ) 
Their confidence levels were very tangible to them and it partly depended on how they felt in their 
clothing and in turn these feelings affected the way they were able to present themselves and feel 
in control of the situation . If the women felt off in their outfit it had negative effects on their 
confidence and ability to present themselves or their ideas to other people . 
Definitely the better I feel about my outfit ; my confidence levels are really tangible to me of 
how I feel I ’ m able to present myself . If I ’ m feeling off with my outfit and I have important 
stuff to do , it ’ s a disaster , it really affects me . It just affects my ability to sell myself , or 
present my ideas confidently , or just feel like I ’ m in control of the meeting .  ( P6 ) 
Furthermore , many women emphasized the importance of dressing uniquely and using their 
clothing to stand out in the crowd , avoid stereotyping , and present their true self . For the woman 
that works in the fashion industry , having a unique style and standing out in the crowd of 
fashionistas is imperative for career opportunities and advancements : 
I always gain more confidence when I stand out from the crowd , versus blending in , I hate 
blending in . It just makes me like everyone else , like what is unique about me ? Nothing .  
( P3 ) 
Another thing is that I don ' t like associating myself to stereotypes , so I try to dress 
somewhat uniquely . I prefer that my true self , and personality shine through .  ( P4 ) 
FASHION AND POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY : INTERACTIONS BETWEEN CLOTHING , MOOD , 
SELF-CONCEPT , AND WELL-BEING
55
Having an individual clothing style and dressing to represent their unique selves is a crucial part 
of the self-concept and well-being for these women and clothing can positively influence their 
confidence , self-esteem , and their ability to achieve their goals . 
Chapter 5
DISCUSSION
This study aimed to investigate how clothing can be used to elevate and reinforce an 
individual ’ s understanding of their self-concept , boost their self-esteem , and enhance their hedonic 
and eudaimonic well-being . I explored the interactions and influences between psychology and 
fashion from a positive psychology perspective using a qualitative research approach . The 
questions that I investigated were as follows :  ( 1 ) How do women experience the selection and 
wearing of clothing in their everyday lives ?  ( 2 ) How does one ’ s self-concept , self-esteem , and 
mood interact with their experiences wearing clothing ?  ( 3 ) How can clothing be used as a styling 
tool to reinforce the self-concept , enhance the self-esteem of women , and in turn promote wellbeing ? The main category that developed from the content analysis of the interviews and daily 
diaries was ‘ Selection and Experience of Clothing to Manage Everyday Well-being ’  , and the 
themes that arose were ‘ Manage Mood ’  ,  ‘ Clothing Strategies for Appearance Management ’  , and 
 ‘ Reinforce and Validate Self-concept ’  . My discussion will be organized to explain the results of 
each sequential theme , beginning with the main category ‘ Selection and Experience of Clothing 
to Manage Everyday Well-being ’ and at the end discussing the implications for well-being . 
Firstly , it was expected that most of these women would have a close and intimate 
relationship with fashion and their clothing because six out of the seven women have studied or 
are currently studying fashion at the undergraduate or graduate level . It is unexpected and 
FASHION AND POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY : INTERACTIONS BETWEEN CLOTHING , MOOD , 
SELF-CONCEPT , AND WELL-BEING
56
interesting to learn however that two of the more mature women have negative viewpoints on 
fashion , as one of the women who has worked in the fashion industry and studied fashion , now 
resents investing so much time and money into her appearance and dressing for the male gaze . The 
other woman agrees with the former that she does not want to be a slave to fashion , dressed head 
to toe in the latest trends , or be an “ unwitting participant in this patriarchal system of oppression .  ” 
Their negative perspectives on fashion have in part developed from working closely in the industry 
and studying fashion from a critical perspective to learn and understand the theories about how the 
fashion industry works and the implications of participating in this system . Five out of the seven 
women have studied or are currently studying fashion at the graduate level ; therefore , they may 
have a different perspective on fashion , clothing , and the industry that is more informed and 
critical , compared to others without this knowledge of fashion . I must also address that six out of 
the seven women are also friends or acquaintances ; thus , they may have been more open and 
comfortable about discussing their clothing practices with a friend-researcher as opposed to a 
stranger-researcher . This study then reveals how these women select their clothing , the main 
factors influencing their choices being where they are going , what they are doing , and the weather . 
Secondary factors are the social expectations for the setting they will be in and who they will be 
interacting with , followed by mood , comfort , and style of the clothing . The life stage of the women 
also plays a role in how they select their clothing because the older women dress more modestly 
and the one that has children has less time to spend on her appearance . Clothing is still an important 
aspect of their self-concept , but in line with previous observations , as women age , their appearance 
becomes a less defining feature of their sense of self-worth as other facets of their life , such as 
motherhood , become more important ( Tiggermann & Lacey ; 2009 ; Tiggermann & Stevens , 1999 )  . 
I would argue that for younger women , appearance and clothing are more influential on their self-
FASHION AND POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY : INTERACTIONS BETWEEN CLOTHING , MOOD , 
SELF-CONCEPT , AND WELL-BEING
57
worth because they are still learning about who they are , and clothing allows them to explore their 
identity and how they want to express themselves as an individual . As women get older , gain an 
array of new life experiences and achieve their goals , they may no longer need to spend as much 
time on their appearance and clothing to validate their self-worth because they have a better 
understanding of their self-concept and higher self-esteem compared to their younger counterparts . 
Previous studies have examined the motivations behind consumer purchasing behaviours , but there 
have been no studies directed at understanding what motivates people to select the clothing they 
wear on a daily basis . This data provides the psychological motives and insight into the daily lived 
experiences women have with their clothing and this knowledge can play a role in how we design , 
market , and brand clothing in the future . Determining and understanding the issues women face 
while dressing , for example choosing what clothes to wear while they are on their period when 
they are bloated and self-conscious , can identify special niche markets waiting to be established . 
To create a viable and sustainable fashion business in the economic and political climate we live 
in today , it is crucial to understand the psychology of your consumer target market and understand 
what clothing means to them and how they experience it in their day to day lives . This can initiate 
changes in design and branding to create the best products that go beyond satisfying their needs 
and actually make their lives better . It would be to the advantage of psychologists , designers , brand 
strategists , and marketers to investigate the struggles all people face while selecting and wearing 
clothing whether they are able bodied , or disabled , trans-gendered , short or tall , thin or big , young 
or old , so that we can identify and understand these problems and work on innovating new products 
with the consumers ’ well-being at the forefront . 
Secondly , this study reveals the significant role clothing choices play as a coping strategy 
in managing mood . The clothing practices of these women in effect primarily enhance positive 
FASHION AND POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY : INTERACTIONS BETWEEN CLOTHING , MOOD , 
SELF-CONCEPT , AND WELL-BEING
58
affect , hedonic well-being , and counteract negative affect , supporting the earlier more positive 
psychological theorizing . This boost in positivity supports Seligman ’ s ( 2011 ) PERMA theory of 
well-being with positive emotion being one of the main elements . Clothing evokes different 
positive and negative feelings and these women use clothing and accessories to cope with the 
different emotions they are feeling . This study contributes to findings emphasizing the important 
relationship between clothing , mood , and emotions ( Moody , Kinderman ,  & Sinha , 2010 ; 
Tiggermann & Lacey , 2009 )  . During the cold winter months , the women experience a negative 
change in mood , feelings of sadness , and anti-social behaviour . With limited clothing options for 
the cold weather , they also feel an emotional difference between dressing up and not dressing up . 
These observations appear to suggest a connection between clothing and seasonal affective 
disorder and future research should explore the connections between clothing practices and mood 
across different seasons . Furthermore , clothing is strategically used to cope with emotions , 
enhance positive affect , and improve low moods , adding to Raunio ’ s ( 1982 ) claim that individuals 
select clothing to cope with their own feelings . This study can also be supported by Bandura ’ s 
( 1986 ) social cognitive theory , which involves the consideration of internal emotions and external 
experiences , self-reflection , and self-regulation through altering behaviour ( i . e . clothing choices ) 
to satisfy their internal and external needs . Goffman ’ s ( 2002 ) argument suggests that daily dress 
routines are organized , and clothing is meticulously selected to manage everyday dynamic and 
unpredictable events and Masuch and Hefferon ’ s ( 2014 ) and Smith ’ s ( 2017b ) findings indicate 
that clothing can be used to manage mood . This previous research , in addition to my current 
findings , suggests clothing is connected to emotional regulation , one of the four categories of 
emotional intelligence ( Goleman , 1996 ; Salovey , 2001 )  . The four categories of emotional 
intelligence include : emotional perception and expression ; the use of emotion ; comprehending 
FASHION AND POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY : INTERACTIONS BETWEEN CLOTHING , MOOD , 
SELF-CONCEPT , AND WELL-BEING
59
emotions ; and emotional regulation ( Salovey , Mayer , and Caruso , 2002 )  . The ability to perceive 
emotional information is key to all other categories of emotional intelligence and works together 
with the fourth category of emotional regulation . This category is described as the ability to 
effectively respond to and manage emotional experiences by redirecting and controlling one ’ s 
emotions through techniques such as exercise , meditation , or listening to music ( Salovey , Mayer , 
and Caruso , 2002 )  . In the present study , the women find great value in becoming more self-aware 
about the connection between their feelings and clothing practices because they now realize how 
they have been using clothing as a response to manage their emotions . The results of this study 
add to the findings of Masuch and Hefferon ( 2014 ) and their argument linking clothing practices 
to emotional perception and emotional regulation . These women can identify when they are feeling 
low and use clothing as a coping strategy to regulate their mood and emotions , counteracting 
negative affect and in turn enhancing positive affect and uplifting mood . Emotional regulation 
skills are critical to manage one ’ s emotions and reduce psychological and cardiovascular stress . I 
concur with the arguments of Salovey ( 2001 ) and Masuch and Hefferon ( 2014 ) that adaptive forms 
of emotional self-regulation can have positive implications on psychological and physiological 
well-being . The technique of employing clothing practices as a coping strategy for managing mood 
and emotions appears to be a neglected tool of affective self-regulation that has potential benefits 
and implications for emotional intelligence . My research deepens our understanding of the 
connections between clothing , mood , and emotion and emphasizes the significance of future 
research to investigate the applications of clothing practices to manage mood . 
Thirdly , this study highlights the clothing strategies women employ to manage their 
appearance and make themselves feel better , adding to Masuch and Hefferon ’ s ( 2014 ) theme of 
using clothing to befriend the body . In addition to fashion , the human body is a topic frequently 
FASHION AND POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY : INTERACTIONS BETWEEN CLOTHING , MOOD , 
SELF-CONCEPT , AND WELL-BEING
60
neglected in the entire field of psychology ( Finlay , 2006 ) and positive psychology ( Hefferon & 
Mutrie , 2012 ; Hefferon , 2013 )  . Clothing is a physical extension of the body that influences the 
cognitive and affective appraisals of the body , which leads to the perception of body-image and 
the development and maintenance of the self-concept ( Stone , 1962 )  . One of the ways in which 
these women cope with their body image anxieties is by employing clothing strategies to augment 
their levels of body satisfaction and overall well-being . The outcomes of this research stress the 
complex nexus between the intrapsychic experience and the physical corporeal experience of 
wearing clothing , an important relationship between the mind and body which challenges 
outmoded Cartesian theories of mind and body dualism . When these women ‘ feel fat ’ they use 
clothing to conceal or camouflage their body , provide comfort , and avoid negative experiences , 
which extends the work of Kwon and Parham ( 1994 )  , Kaiser ( 1990 )  , and Kang , Johnson , and Kim 
( 2012 )  . Adding to the work of Kwon and Parham ( 1994 ) Frith and Gleeson ( 2008 )  , this study 
reveals that when women feel confident , they have clothing strategies to show off their best 
features and parts of their body they feel proud of . Expanding the observations of Skeggs ( 1997 ) 
and McKinley ( 2002 )  , possessing appearance management skills of knowing what clothing looks 
and feels good on your body , can foster pride , confidence , and a sense of mastery and autonomy 
over the body . Dittmar ( 2009 ) contends that body image is an essential aspect of well-being , 
therefore I would argue that knowing your body and having the skills to strategically use clothing 
to improve the way you look and feel can enhance positive affect and hedonic well-being . This 
study also shows that appearance management with clothing serves to regulate the external 
environment by managing the impressions of others and mediating social interactions , supporting 
the work of ( Raunio , 1982 ; Sontag & Lee , 2004 )  . Clothing can give women autonomy over their 
body and the self-image they want to project to the world and this makes them feel good and more 
FASHION AND POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY : INTERACTIONS BETWEEN CLOTHING , MOOD , 
SELF-CONCEPT , AND WELL-BEING
61
confident in themselves . Women use clothing to self-curate their identity ( Hall , 1996 ) in real life 
and online with social media in order to project their ideal image to the world . Social media has 
also been linked to narcissism and self-esteem because it allows users to have complete power 
over how they present their self-image to the world ; they stage a desirable public display of their 
 “ possible selves ” by uploading attractive and self-promoting photos ( Zhao , Grasmuck ,  & Martin , 
2008 ; Buffardi & Campbell , 2008 )  . The way women represent themselves online with clothing 
and how that interacts with their self-concept , self-esteem , and mood , would be another interesting 
avenue of research . Kang , Johnson , and Kim ( 2012 ) have observed that negative evaluations by 
others may lead individuals to strategically use their clothing to blend in or avoid negative 
experiences , an observation seen in this study as the women use clothing to mediate their social 
interactions . Clothing can create a feeling of social belonging to facilitate social interactions , but 
one can also experience negative consequences as a result of what they are wearing . In accordance 
to Raunio ’ s ( 1982 ) research , in order to cope with social anxieties , the women develop clothing 
strategies that can mediate how outgoing and social they want to be and who they want to interact 
with . Sustaining solid affirmative relationships contribute to our happiness and is another 
fundamental factor in the PERMA theory of well-being ( Guay et al .  , 2013 ; Seligman , 2011 )  . The 
evidence clearly indicates that fashion can serve as a vehicle to manage their body image and 
appearance to evoke and maintain elevated levels of body satisfaction , suggesting the implications 
of clothing for body-image and well-being research in positive psychology . 
Fourthly , these women use clothing to reinforce and validate their self-concept by 
projecting satisfying images of themselves , portraying their ideal-selves in social situations , and 
exploring different possible selves with their clothing . For these women , clothing is an important 
aspect of their self-concept ( Sontag & Schlater , 1982 ; 5 ) and supported by Rosenberg ’ s self-
FASHION AND POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY : INTERACTIONS BETWEEN CLOTHING , MOOD , 
SELF-CONCEPT , AND WELL-BEING
62
consistency motive ( 1979 )  , their experiences demonstrate that they use clothing in a way that is 
consistent with their self-image ( Sontag & Lee , 2004 )  . The discrepancies these women experience 
within their self-concept , which produces negative affect ( Markus & Nurius , 1986 )  , were shown 
to be resolved by using different clothing strategies as previously mentioned . This study explains 
how these women use clothing to express different possible selves ( Markus & Nurius , 1986 : 954 )  , 
similar to the research by Guy and Banim ( 2000 ) and their interpretation of three coexisting views 
of the self :  ‘ The woman I want to be ’  ,  ‘ The woman I fear I could be ’ and ‘ The woman I am most 
of the time ’  . This first view of the self implicates the inclusion of the ideal-self and ideal-social 
self , and these were highly influential on the women ’ s selection of clothing when they were 
attempting to create and portray desirable images of themselves to the public sphere . The present 
findings illustrate the meticulous selection of clothing to maintain and portray favourable images 
of themselves for impression management and to influence their social interactions , supporting 
Goffman ’ s ( 2002 ) notion of the presentation of the self and Bandura ’ s ( 1986 ) social cognitive 
theory . Although some women say they dress for themselves , there still appears to be an underlying 
unconscious bias to dress for social approval and conformity , supported by the fundamental human 
drive of needing to belong ( Baumeister and Leary , 1995 )  . The need to fit in aids in satisfying the 
self-esteem and self-consistency motives and to fulfill ends , goals , or values ( Rosenberg , 1979 : 
47 )  . The notion of the ideal-self represents the self that we strive to become and by using clothing 
to create an image to self-actualize and achieve our potential , this suggests the power of clothing 
to promote eudaimonic well-being . Using clothing as a styling tool to create and present an image 
that is consistent with your goals and the person you want to become serves to reinforce and 
validate your self-concept . Furthermore , by reflecting on their clothing and their experiences 
wearing clothing , these women realized the positive influence clothing had on their confidence 
FASHION AND POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY : INTERACTIONS BETWEEN CLOTHING , MOOD , 
SELF-CONCEPT , AND WELL-BEING
63
and self-esteem , supporting earlier theorizing by Horn ( 1968 )  . Wearing clothing that makes them 
feel like their ideal-self and reflecting on the experiences wearing those clothes gives them an ego 
boost , supporting the phenomenon of looking good and feeling good . Knowing yourself and 
understanding your self-concept allows you to create a self-image with clothing that is consistent 
with your thoughts and emotions about your ideal-self . The process of reflecting in a diary about 
your thoughts and feelings wearing clothing proposes the value it has on growing healthy selfesteem , confidence , positive emotions , and well-being . Altogether , the perception of the ideal-self , 
self-esteem , and confidence , emerge as imperative components that contribute to well-being and 
flourishing with fashion . The evidence gained in this study establishes the crucial roles clothing 
plays in relation to our psychology and well-being , an area of research that is frequently 
overlooked . These findings have many implications for the field of fashion and positive 
psychology and future research should continue to explore how the perceptions of the ideal-self 
interact with clothing practices to positively influence confidence , self-esteem , and well-being . 
Lastly , all of the categories that evolved from this study demonstrate the complex 
mechanisms women employ to manage their everyday well-being through clothing . The 
observations showing how clothing can enhance positive emotionality , thus validate the 
connection between clothing and hedonic well-being , a relationship that consistently emerged 
throughout the analysis . The value of positive emotions should not be underestimated because they 
can endure long past the moment . Positive emotions play an important role in Frederickson ’ s 
( 2009 ) broaden-and-build theory to compose the social and psychological resources that expand 
one ’ s awareness and encourage curious exploration in thoughts and behaviour . Positive emotions 
in turn encourage sociability , receptivity , and resourcefulness ( Frederickson & Branigan , 2005 )  , 
inspire motivation and stamina ( González-Romá & Gamero , 2012 )  , lower the harmful 
FASHION AND POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY : INTERACTIONS BETWEEN CLOTHING , MOOD , 
SELF-CONCEPT , AND WELL-BEING
64
consequences of negative affect ( Frederickson , 2009 )  , and are also an important factor in the 
PERMA theory of well-being ( Seligman , 2011 )  . The positive change in emotions and motivation 
these women experience when getting dressed , emphasizes the importance of clothing for hedonic 
well-being and positive psychology . In the case of eudaimonic well-being , the other side of the 
overlapping paradigm of well-being , clothing enhances eudaimonic well-being through individual 
self-actualization and meaning making processes ( Hefferon & Boniwell , 2011 ; King et . al , 2006 ; 
Ryff & Singer , 2008 ) that foster personal growth and development ( Seligman , 2011 )  , authenticity 
( Waterman , 2011 )  , and self-expressiveness ( Waterman , 1993 )  . Some of the clothing these women 
hold onto have great sentimental value that symbolizes personal histories and achievements , 
nostalgia about their family , childhood , past experiences , and relationships . Reinforcing this 
connection between clothing and eudaimonic well-being , nostalgia is described by Sedikides , 
Wildschut , and Baden ( 2004 , p . 208 ) as ‘ an existential exercise in search for identity and meaning ’ 
and ‘ a positive emotional and experiential reservoir ’  ( p . 211 )  . Clothing supports the self-concept
of these women , helps shape their identity , and is kept and treasured because it carries nostalgic 
value that arouses positive affect and meaningful memories , hence strengthening their selfnarratives as it relates to their past relationships , times , and selves ( Guy and Banim , 2000 ; Masuch 
and Hefferon , 2014 )  . The link between clothing and well-being also accords to Seligman ’ s ( 2011 ) 
PERMA theory with meaningful relationships being another important factor of well-being . 
Therefore , it is argued that when worn on the body , clothing that bears nostalgia reactivates 
meaningful memories , reinforces the self-concept , and social bonds , altogether to promote 
eudaimonic well-being . This evidence supports the power of clothing to manage everyday wellbeing and promote flourishing . Future scholarly research in the field of positive psychology should 
continue to try and understand how individuals create meaning with their clothing , how it

SELF-CONCEPT , AND WELL-BEING
65
contributes to the development and maintenance of their self-concept , and how it serves as a source 
of hedonic and eudaimonic well-being . 
Chapter 6
CONCLUSION , LIMITATIONS , AND FUTURE RESEARCH
The aim of this study was to explore the topic of women ’ s clothing practices from a positive 
psychology perspective . Through qualitative research and analysis , this study determined how a 
group of women interested in fashion select and experience clothing to manage their everyday 
well-being . Clothing is employed as a styling tool to manage their mood , different clothing 
strategies are in place to manage their appearance , social interactions , and feelings about 
themselves , and the clothing they wear reinforces and validates their self-concept . The findings of 
this study indicate a strong connection between clothing , emotion , mood , self-concept , and selfesteem . This study provides evidence to confirm and extend earlier theoretical writings in positive 
psychology arguing that the daily rituals of selecting our clothing and dressing up evokes positive 
emotions , satisfaction , enhances our self-concept , and is linked to our well-being . It also supports 
more recent work by Masuch and Hefferon ( 2014 ) and Smith ( 2017b ) and emphasizes the 
importance of further inquiry to study the implications clothing practices in positive psychology . 
However , it is still important to consider the limitations when interpreting the results of 
this research . Firstly , this study was conducted from the perspective of positive psychology and it 
may be argued that this introduced bias in the methods and analysis . The interview questions and 
guideline for the daily diary were carefully worded to not impose positive answers , but instead 
allow for open conversation and encourage free writing . This study explored positive and negative 
experiences with clothing and both accounts were equally considered in the process of analysis

SELF-CONCEPT , AND WELL-BEING

and presentation of the results . The researcher also met frequently with the supervising faculty 
member to discuss the results of the study and to maintain rigour and ensure every effort was made 
to minimize bias . The data collected in this study could have been analyzed in many different ways 
and from different perspectives , therefore my interpretation of this data is specific to a certain time 
frame and mind frame ( Shaw , 2010 )  . Secondly , the small sample size used in any IPA study is a 
possible limitation . Nonetheless , according to Hefferon and Gill-Rodriquez ( 2011 ) a sample size 
of three to six participants is sufficient to produce themes while preserving the integrity of 
individual narratives and not having an overwhelming amount of data for the researcher to analyze . 
The women from this sample are also highly engaged with fashion in their work or academic 
studies and they are friends of the researcher . Thus , it would be interesting and useful to study this 
topic among different groups of people unknown to the researcher and more diverse samples of 
men and women to observe the commonalities or differences in their experiences to further 
understand how clothing practices are linked to well-being . 
This study , inspired by the work of Masuch and Hefferon ( 2014 )  , has expanded the 
framework for which we study fashion and has opened up new avenues for future scholarly inquiry . 
Future research should continue to employ daily clothing diaries to encourage people to reflect on 
their feelings in their clothing . We could consider whether settling for an “ okay ” outfit negatively 
impacts feelings of the self-concept or hinders confidence or performance to achieve goals . 
Subsequently , a styling component could be added to future studies by offering professional 
styling advice and a makeover to determine how feelings about the self-concept , self-esteem , 
emotion , and performance differ from before and after the makeover . Research to study the 
phenomenon of looking good and feeling good in clothing should explore how intentional dressing 
makes people feel and how it influences different social , emotional , and performance aspects of

SELF-CONCEPT , AND WELL-BEING
67
their life . We should also consider studying the application of clothing for emotional intelligence 
and positive self-image to determine whether dressing differently can help someone who is 
stressed and emotional feel less stressed , better about themselves , and happier . Another aspect to 
consider is designing clothes with more balance between comfort and style to highlight more of 
an importance on how clothing can make us feel , rather than just how it looks . Changing the design 
process to focus more attention on well-being and how people feel in clothing would be a novel 
approach to design that could add more meaning to clothing , make clothing more accessible , and 
satisfying to the customer . In addition , well-being through clothing could also be harnessed as part 
of a branding strategy for fashion businesses , especially since the wellness sector is so popular
right now with yoga , meditation , and mindful thinking being all the rage . Lastly , if we know 
ourselves , have a good relationship with our clothing , and know what clothes make us feel good , 
do we need to keep buying so much ? Future research should consider how individual flourishing 
with fashion can lead to a change in our mindset about how we consume clothing so that we buy 
less and banish the disposable reputation of clothing . And perhaps this could propel a change in 
how the fashion system functions ; to produce less poor quality disposable clothing and instead 
produce higher quality items that people will actually love , treasure , and find useful for a long 
time . 
In conclusion , this study contributes to filling the gap between the fields of positive 
psychology and fashion by making novel contributions demonstrating the powerful potential of 
clothing to evoke positive emotions , manage mood and appearance , enhance self-esteem , selfconcept , and well-being . This study suggests that fashion and clothing practices are an intriguing 
yet neglected area of study for positive psychology . This study has unearthed a rich source of 
information about individual clothing practices and the accompanying thoughts , feelings , attitudes ,

68
and behaviours . It highlights a few of the multitude of complex psychological mechanisms 
involved in influencing clothing behaviour . This study expands our knowledge and understanding 
about the psychology motivating clothing behaviour , the positive and negative experiences women 
have wearing clothing , and it highlights the potential of employing clothing to promote well-being , 
providing insight for psychologists , brand strategists , marketers , and designers . Therefore , this 
study makes a modest , yet important contribution to help establish fashion as a legitimate and 
worthy area of study for further psychological inquiry . Clothing is so much more than something 
we wear on the body for protection and warmth , and in the words of the famous fashion 
photographer Bill Cunningham ,  “ The wider world perceives fashion as frivolity , that should be 
done away with . The point is that fashion is the armour to survive the reality of everyday life . I 
don ' t think you can do away with it , it would be like doing away with civilisation ”  ( Whitworth , 
2011 )  . Clothing is an important part of everyday dressing that can be a source to energize our 
bodies and minds and allow us to live happy and fulfilling lives .

Consent Form
Ryerson University
Consent Agreement
You are being invited to participate in a research study . Please read this consent form so that 
you understand what your participation will involve . Before you consent to participate , please 
ask any questions to be sure you understand what your participation will involve . 
Fashion and Positive Psychology : Intersections between clothing , self-concept , and wellbeing
INVESTIGATORS : This research study is being conducted by a graduate student Juliana Scott 
under the supervision of Osmud Rahman , from the School of Fashion at Ryerson University . 
If you have any questions or concerns about the research , please feel free to contact Juliana Scott 
via email at j11scott @ ryerson . ca . 
PURPOSE OF THE STUDY : The purpose of this research study is to understand your 
experience of wearing clothing and how that experience interacts with and impacts your selfconcept , the way you see and think about yourself . This study will explore how fashion interacts 
with your self-concept ( self-image , ideal-self , social-self ) and self-esteem by questioning what 
you choose to wear , what strategies you use to decide what to wear , and how the wearing of that 
clothing makes you feel about yourself . This study will recruit ten participants that identify as 
female between the ages of 20 to 40 years old in the cities of Toronto or Guelph with an interest 
in fashion or clothing and what they wear . You must have the time , willingness , and commitment 
to participate in this in-depth study . You must also have the capacity to consent to this study on 
your own behalf . The results of study will contribute to a major research project for completion 
of a Masters of Fashion degree . 
WHAT YOU WILL BE ASKED TO DO : If you volunteer to participate in this study , you will 
be asked to do the following things : 
• Complete an online demographic information questionnaire ( 3 mins )  : name , age , 
gender , ethnicity , job / career , email address , phone number , and home address . Contact 
information will be used to contact you during the study . 
• Complete a short online personal account questionnaire ( 10-25 mins ) by answering 
questions regarding your interest in fashion , your personal clothing style , and what 
clothing means to you . 
FASHION AND POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY : INTERACTIONS BETWEEN CLOTHING , MOOD , 
SELF-CONCEPT , AND WELL-BEING

• You will then be asked to participate in a four week long “ daily ” diary ( minimum 3-4 
entries per week ) that will ask you to describe the clothing you selected to wear , take note 
of things such as how you feel about yourself that day , what you chose to wear , why you 
chose it , and how the clothing makes you feel ( 10-25 mins per daily entry , time will vary 
depending on the person )  . You will be asked to take photos of your daily outfit , your face 
does not have to be in it . Taking photos of your outfits is optional . The photos will 
provide insight into your clothing style and connect your experiences and feelings with 
the actual outfit you wore . Photos will be revisited during the wardrobe interview to 
provide recollection of the outfits you wore and initiate further reflection upon your 
experience in those specific outfits . Photos of your garments or outfits may be published 
in the research upon your permission . It will be important to note any situations that 
occur throughout your day that may have changed your mood , emotions , or feelings 
about yourself and have impacted the way you feel in your clothes . For example , you 
may have felt happy and confident wearing the outfit you chose to put on , but those 
feelings may have changed when a co-worker made a comment directed to you at work . 
If a change in mood or the way you feel or think about yourself in your clothing made 
you change your outfit , also note those feelings and changes in clothing . It will be 
important to have self-awareness to realize and note the daily fluctuations in your mood , 
emotions , and the way you feel about yourself ( self-concept ) to gain insight into your 
everyday experiences , feelings , and reactions aroused through the experience of choosing 
and wearing clothing and the impact it has on you . 
• Lastly , upon completion of the daily diary you will be asked to participate in a wardrobe 
interview ( 30-60 mins maximum ) in your home to explore your personal wardrobe 
collection to understand your clothing style and ask you to reflect on your specific 
experiences with the daily diary . You will be asked to discuss what you have learned 
about your experiences with clothing and how clothing interacts with your mood , 
emotions , and self-concept . This interview will be audio-recorded and transcribed . Photos 
of outfits or pieces in your wardrobe may be taken upon your consent . Some of the 
research questions may include : 
o What outfits or pieces of clothing enhanced aspects of your self-concept ( selfesteem , self-image , self-worth )  ? 
o How did your daily experiences impact the way you felt in your clothing ? 
o How did your self awareness about your clothing practices change throughout the 
study ? 
The results of this research study will be made available to you upon completion of the final 
paper . 
POTENTIAL BENEFITS : You as a participant may benefit from the study by understanding 
yourself better through the cognitive process of self-reflection and examination and realize the 
impact clothing has on you . This research may also be considered to be a small contribution 
reintroducing the study of fashion into the realm of positive psychological research . The 
outcomes of this study may provide some exciting information for psychologists interested in 
clothing behaviour and positive psychologists interested in understanding how clothing is linked 
to our self-concept and well-being . I intend to build on the theories of previous research that 
FASHION AND POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY : INTERACTIONS BETWEEN CLOTHING , MOOD , 
SELF-CONCEPT , AND WELL-BEING
xi
argue clothing contributes to our well-being and that we can actively use fashion and styling of 
clothing to make ourselves happier , more positive , confident , and more efficient in all aspects of 
life . 
I cannot guarantee , however , that you will receive any benefits from participating in this study . 
WHAT ARE THE POTENTIAL RISKS TO YOU AS A PARTICIPANT : The potential 
risks of this study are very low , however due to the personal nature of the study that requires 
increased self-awareness about your emotions , feelings , and reflections about your daily 
experiences with clothing , it may arouse feelings of anxiety or discomfort . These feelings will 
also depend on your vulnerabilities and how you cope with stress . Should you feel discomfort 
upon being asked a question or reflecting on your experience with clothing , you can skip the 
question or stop participating in the study , either temporarily or permanently . 
CONFIDENTIALITY : The participant ’ s personal information ( names , contact information , 
etc .  ) will remain confidential . Participant information will be coded and names will be changed 
to maintain confidentiality . Real names will not be used in the publication of this 
research . Identifying information will be encrypted , stored , and password protected using a 
private Google Drive . Data will be retained until the research project is complete and identifying 
personal information , data , and audio recordings , will be deleted and destroyed after publications 
and presentations of the research after approximately 3 years . 
VOLUNTARY PARTICIPATION AND WITHDRAWAL : Participation in this study is 
completely voluntary . You can choose whether to be in this study or not . If any question makes 
you uncomfortable , you can skip that question . If you choose to stop participating , you may also 
choose to not have your data included in the study up until March 1st , 2018 . Participants may 
choose to stop participating at any time and withdrawal from the study will not influence future 
relations with the researchers [ Juliana Scott and Osmud Rahman ] or Ryerson University . 
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE STUDY : If you have any questions about the research now , please 
ask . If you have questions later about the research , you may contact the researcher Juliana Scott 
via email at j11scott @ ryerson . ca or supervisor of the research Osmud Rahman via email at 
orahman @ ryerson . ca .
