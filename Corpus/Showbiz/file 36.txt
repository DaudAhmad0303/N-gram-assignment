hello and welcome to close-up with The
Hollywood Reporter directors I ' m Steven
Galloway and I ' d like to welcome
Fernando Morales CQ Martin Scorsese Noah
Baumbach Lulu Wong Todd Phillips and
Greta Gerwig thank you for being here
thank you I will start with the business
before we get to the film several of you
who ' ve worked in the business for a
while what has changed
most significantly for good and bad
Marty let ' s start with you what has
changed for good bad where would you
begin again I mean basically we could
take the Irishman for nine years we
couldn ' t get financing that means things
have improved financially no I don ' t
know what what you want me to say I
think what you were getting at is
through three of the film makers here
made movies for Netflix that ' s huge
changed out of six directors here three
of the films are on Netflix that ' s been
a giant change in the business and
ultimately the the situation in my case
in terms of Irishman was something that
DeNiro and I hadn ' t made a picture since
1995 casino and over the years we wanted
to make another film and then we never
kind of met on certain subject matter
and things changed you know
life goes on and we looked around and
we ' re still interested in working with
each other long story bottom line is
that we get to be 72 73 74 years old and
he comes up with this book that Eric
Roth gave him describes the character to
me becomes extremely passionate and
somewhat emotional about it and I said
well that might be it and really
couldn ' t get the financing with him and
Al and Joe couldn ' t get the financing so
he went off did his work I went off and
did some films and when the time came
around any possibility of them playing
younger was out of the question
it was gone God so he looked at each
other so I wanted up I want to shoot
silence I had to go and make silence
yeah and that ' s when Pablo helman
mentioned the de-aging I think
unification which is something we heard
about but was almost like science
fiction you know we did a test of DeNiro
doing Goodfellow scene in Goodfellas and
we did it him again and we played it
back two months later and we said let ' s
take the risk
let ' s try for it but of course that
comes with a price tag right you know
then it was even more money in terms of
the budget in terms of that so
ultimately what happened was that we
still after we still could not get
richer financed and I got a call from
Ricky on said you interested in Netflix
and I said what ' s the story there and
they explained it financially the film
would be complete backing will need to
take the risks with the
computer-generated imagery you call it
that but you know it ' s more complicated
and certainly the main thing for me was
creative freedom the trade-off is that
it ' s a streamer okay however I said but
it will be shown in theaters right by
that point you know I ' ve been at this
like 47 years I think so at that point
I ' ve had a few films I mentioned this
the other day I ' ve had a few films play
one or two weeks in the theatre and
taken out right yeah including
especially King of Comedy right yeah
lasted a week and a half they took it
out is that never shown again you know
yeah I see this film of the two popes
we ' re like 35 festivals then we ' re gonna
have it like two three weeks so yes
theatre and then the plataform I mean
can ' t be better yeah we ' re having older
yeah and it stays in theaters yeah
question is that we ' re in the more than
an evolution we ' re in a revolution of
communication and cinema really or
movies or film whatever you want to call
it and now all these venues you know
because the the audience for Netflix for
instance is much bigger than theatrical
audience they can take risks actually
how you shoot a film if you know it ' s
going to be seen on a TV screen I mean
for me it didn ' t know I ' d be approached
it exactly the same way and and Netflix
also has made adjustments I mean even as
recently as two year
ago there was still there was no
exclusive theatrical run they would do
theatrical but it was always day and
date and now you know they ' ve they ' ve
adjusted I ' ve never had a movie released
wide immediately it ' s always been a roll
out you know New York LA and you know
then it moves out to the thing and then
and then you break wider and and often
that ' s where their bigger challenges
because suddenly you ' re competing for
theaters with you know giant
blockbusters no matter how well your
movie may be doing sort of in cities and
and and so in a sense I feel like
Netflix almost reflects the traditional
independent cinema model now which is
you get to play exclusively in theaters
you roll out you can kind of you know
have and then the wide break is Netflix
which in a sense is a more democratic
break for these movies yeah I just say
cuz I have a slightly different
perspective on the streaming versus you
know independent studios not even the
big studios you know I ' ll just say to be
totally honest I would not be at this
table if it wasn ' t for our small
independent studio because we got an
offer at Sundance from a 24 and also got
a much larger double offer from a large
streaming platform and you know the
financier and producers of course were
like are you crazy we have to take this
bigger deal and I said no it ' s not about
the money
one thing we sometimes don ' t talk about
with some of these bigger streaming
platforms is that you know it ' s a
different business model it ' s not
necessarily about making money back
it ' s about brand their building their
brand and when you ' re an established
filmmaker you are a brand that they want
to partner with to help build their own
brand but with newer filmmakers newer
voices you don ' t have a brand you need
to build that brand and I know now cuz
our film has been in the theaters for
four months you know for a film that 75
80 percent in Mandarin subtitled but is
an American film you know it ' s an even
first of all get that financed but then
to have that play as an American film a
hundred percent Asian Asian American
cast to be seen as an American story and
play in theaters for four months and
then for me to be at this
able I for a fact that if I took that
bigger you know the bigger money that
they wouldn ' t have the energy to put
behind someone like me to build my brand
when they have so many esteemed
established directors that that are also
part of the conversation negative to to
it is a filmmaker like Lulu would get
lost because no way to find it yes but
you ' re not gonna these guys right and
that ' s what they ' re saying their pitch
was we have a huge global platform like
we have millions of eyeballs but you
know if you look at the music business
and you say to a small independent
musician you can put your music on
iTunes
anybody can upload their music to itunes
or maybe even Spotify these these days
it doesn ' t really matter because if
people don ' t know how to find you it
doesn ' t why did it and there are
different business models within the
streaming services to it ' s not they they
have different ways that they treat
different one of the things I was
thinking I never thought of it in terms
of this gonna sound strange I never
thought of it in terms of money for me
yeah for me it was desperation for 160
million dollars doesn ' t matter is
desperation it had to be done right and
I ' m not saying to all were relegated and
Netflix did a great job you have done it
if it didn ' t have a theatrical release
guaranteed maybe Wow oh yeah it had to
be done because I had to be it was from
here and we ' re too old now as you know
Marty said that a lot of the film AIDS
Day are themed part right Marty wedding
want to be precise and a lot of Marvel
films are themed pot I said I said
superhero films superhero film never I
don ' t even know Marvel our members are
comical you ' ve never enough to doctor I
can marvel film huh you ' ve never been
asked to direct and well know who here
became to me
director Marvel film you have superhero
films that essentially seem part right I
mean maybe sure the who but I like theme
park rides yeah I could explain a little
about what that is you just when you
state it like that it ' s like things
coming yeah
in India because yeah we coach you ask
me what ' s worth think about tomorrow
it ' s the you know when Disneyland was
built I ' m better ancient you know and
one of the aspirations of the studios
was to become as important in a sense to
American culture as a Disneyland and I
think the first studio to really do that
was Universal Universal tours and then
you add the blockbuster on top of that
and why not the sense of theme park has
always been there it ' s always been it ' s
not bad we used to love to go to
amusement parks you know but now in an
amusement park you have the film because
I don ' t think that theme parks are and I
don ' t think that ' s what you were saying
that it ' s negative I think you ' re making
the distinction between cinema the the
the bigger entertainment things which is
which is really made by committee and
that ' s one of the reasons I don ' t want
to do it right now because I don ' t have
them I haven ' t figured out my voice yet
as a filmmaker and and I agree that we
have to talk about cinema not in a
pretentious way but when I was on set
you know sometimes there were some
people who are like oh the girls want to
make cinema and there was like this I ' ve
always been the case it ' s oh yeah that ' s
always been like oh nice starting to
stop at this art business we used to get
nice and what I hear on this I ' m doing
but making a movie and you know yeah
exactly
you said these are not cinema Gretel
what is cinema I don ' t know I mean I
know what when I see it I see it I know
I know
I know when you sit in a movie theater
and I ' ve had the privilege of like but
you know being a Film Festival jury
which is in some ways the really pure
way to watch movies because you you have
nothing you have no context for what the
thing it is you ' re seeing and and you
don ' t miss it from the first shot you
know you know when there ' s an author
there and you know when it ' s personal
and you know it you can feel it you can
feel it comes through every moment every
shot every and the actors and every
piece of it and it and it just doesn ' t
miss
you and I don ' t know that I can explain
it better than that but you just know it
when you see it and sometimes for
whatever reason a stretch will go by and
they don ' t see something that hits me
like that and then I ' ll go to the movie
theater and I ' ll see something you know
it ' s just it makes you fall in love with
the form and yet yeah I don ' t know I
love like when you catch resurface and
like you catch something on your just
the TV on and you ' re in the middle of a
movie and you know immediately there ' s a
there ' s a personality and a voice behind
it that ' s you know that ' s almost the
feeding in the seventies that every film
you thought could change your life
that ' s right you told us that still true
today I mean I I think it is but if I ' d
go back to the what Marty said about
cinema and yeah and because because I
think really he got a lot of heat for it
but I understand fully what you were
saying you know when we were struggling
to get Joker made which sounds funny
because it exists in the superhero world
but it ' s really not one of those movies
in fact it was greatly inspired by the
works of Martin Scorsese and Sidney
lament and other filmmakers that I sort
of grew up worshipping in the 70s and
early 80 ' s and their movies but we had a
really hard time getting that film made
which seems insane today now seeing how
well the movies done we spent a year at
Warner Brothers and I saw emails back
and forth literally where they said does
he realize meaning me does he realize we
sell joker pajamas at Target and so is
that true it ' s very what you ' re saying
where these come first the pajamas
movies you can ' t make your decisions
based on that and that was my argument
of course was we ' re really gonna dictate
but you know movies based on pajamas but
it but it exists this idea but you know
those pajamas when you see them well I
mean one of us you get you get one
person to be your ally yeah you in one
by one I mean I you know I mean the
problem at Warner ' s for me was was the
regime changed so and so you finally get
everybody on board and all of a sudden
they ' re gone
and now you ' re starting over and when
you start over with you know sometimes
people don ' t like to inherit
other stuff from Avellino around say
your comedy here ' s a good example is it
yeah so you ' re overcoming that but but I
mean in this film in particular luckily
we had um the head of marketing who
didn ' t change Blair rich who ' s really
championed it from the script and got
what we were trying to do got that it
was sort of an anti comic book movie so
to speak that it was a character study a
deep dive and really a movie you know
that explored mental illness that
explored compassion that explored all
these sort of things we wanted to do
under the guise of a comic book film and
in fairness to Warner ' s I mean when you
see the movie you ' ve seen it it ' s it ' s a
bold swinging for a studio to take or
did they ask you to change they didn ' t
Jenny thing I mean that wasn ' t that
wasn ' t part of the conversation it was
just about yes or no and DC Comics was
involved because they owned the
character they didn ' t ask us to change
one thing once they came on board it was
it was a thing but it was a literally a
year from a finished script to a
greenlight we worried before the film
came out there might be some violence no
because I just didn ' t subscribe to that
quite frankly [ __ ] thing that was
happening in the media where they just
pick a movie every so often and declare
it it means something that it doesn ' t I
mean we had think pieces being written
about this movie where people proudly
wrote I haven ' t seen the movie I don ' t
need to say the movie I ' m not gonna see
the movie and then they would write two
pages about why the movies bad I mean I
don ' t think there ' s been more can I tell
you a studio she said to me I ' m not
going to see that movie I said you ' re a
studio chief yeah yeah don ' t say who but
yeah go ahead and produce this film your
partner Hamlet is the producer on it why
did you decide not to produce personal
reasons I think for me also scheduling
and primary I mean quite honestly taxi
driver and king of comedy and last
imitation of Christ you know my time
those were my fights yes that wasn ' t a
fight we did it and then there were some
consequences to be paid at this point in
time then we went ahead and did King of
Comedy and we were attacked for that and
the film was considered the flop of the
year and the new show Entertainment
Tonight on New Year ' s Eve I was putting
my tie on and I look over in this TV and
said now the flop of the year and a
curtain open it was
King of Comedy and we would everything
had turn to hold the whole all of
Hollywood have turned against that kind
of filmmaking really are the reasons to
do you think in a funny way because I
mean I think we all romanticize sort of
you know well said that this sort of you
know you ' re the 70s and even early
eighties perhaps in a funny way do you
think King of Comedy would have done
better 15 years later with independent
studios because they were yeah it
wouldn ' t have it would have been like a
twenty four these companies would have
known what to do was that however in
1978 79 79 Apocalypse Now right at you
way then Raging Bull 1980 10 days later
heaven ' s gate opens up was the end well
I ' m not saying that I ' m just saying they
finish the fault they ' ve had enough of
these crazed or tours yeah and everybody
including the the critical community
particularly in New York Times one
review the film closed one night so that
was the end of it all and then you had
other films that were being made that
were you know wonderful sci-fi fantasy
things and people wanted to see those we
go ahead and make King of Comedy we just
made raging bold so when people went to
see if they expected Janiero as as Jake
LaMotta again and that changed things
you see yeah and at that point also the
studio had changed right
so they said so that ' s doing it yeah God
picture finish so I went I try to do
Last Temptation of Christ was 1983 I
spent the whole year here and six weeks
before shooting started was cancelled
which point I said I think I should
leave death threats when you do loss yes
yes you don ' t go through the fight did
you mean you didn ' t want to go through
that again with Joker or you didn ' t know
it ' s an issue it ' s a personal issue
about the kind of picture I want to make
at this point in my life I wanted I ' m
more comfortable with this picture
Irishman I ' m more comfortable there you
know if I could help if I can help a
younger filmmaker get something good but
God knows he ' s them The Hangover things
and yeah you know we were talking about
this because yeah you live outside the
Hollywood system an international maker
you need an easier position or
that tougher have that world changed too
for me it ' s been easier I mean because I
don ' t have the involvement I don ' t have
to to to to make people like me you know
so I can be very and I ' m finding very
good producer that supports what I want
to do so I ' m I ' m very independent in
whatever I want to do and without having
to to please people around because I
don ' t depend on on the get this I ' m
really yeah it ' s very there ' s a very
good thing about being an outsider and
one thing to be an outsider did you ever
think of moving to America no I have
very deep roots in Brazil and I like to
to to direct in Portuguese what I ' m
doing the last years when I went to to
direct in Portuguese I ' m doing TV TV
series and because it ' s different I mean
I understand English but I don ' t feel
English when you like like if you say
mango tree in English this is just a
tree in Portuguese mangueira
is my mother sometimes that ' s what was
the toughest thing about making two
popes I think when I read the script I
lifted dialogues and I said yes and then
I realized that the film was two men
talking about religion quite exciting
isn ' t it it ' s just about how to make it
cinematic so that was the big challenge
how big was the bankability of your
actors a factor in making the film were
you at all like no no I was completely
free to cast and to be honest how I cast
johnson price i google when when I
signed the film
I looked for pictures of the Pope just
to see how he felt and there was a lot
of picture of him and next to the price
because they look alike
the obvious choice what this guy just
he ' s being himself he ' s great and I felt
he ' s so humble and funny and I said he
has the same kind of energy from the
book this guy look alike and has the
same let ' s go for him and I mean did you
have watchable any either of those popes
now while I shook hands with Pope
Francis and I told him I ' m making a film
on you he couldn ' t care less you you
have a screening of violence at the
balcony yes he was not at that screen he
soared later yeah yeah and what extent
is autobiographical Philip Roth has a
great quote about you that he would keep
he always started by taking two stones
of reality and rubbing them together to
spark the imagination and and I find I
mean I respond to that because I often
you know I like your shooting in New
York I like to shoot on streets that I
have memories from childhood you know
things and it again doesn ' t have to have
any resonance with the specifics of the
movie but it puts me in a place of
creativity you know I feel like so much
of what we do is a kind of conversation
with the child we were you know the and
it ' s that place of play you know I try
to use all of these things that I put
then familiar people in the movies you
know friends my doorman our doorman yeah
cuz I mean like when your mom is and
whether you know it or not it ' s it ' s you
you connect to something personal
because I think you can feel it even if
you don ' t know it but it it makes me I
mean it goes to what we were talking
about how we like our sets I mean I you
know I ' d like to feel kind of at home
and its relaxed and calm at home on a
set and I feel like then I can chaos and
it can come from that
how much does autobiography come into
your films one of them seemed to be very
autobiographical and now you ' ve made
little women which seems not to be that
is that true well I think for me for
little women that that book meant so
much to me and it was a book that I I
don ' t ever remember not knowing who the
March sisters were I always knew who Joe
March was I always knew those sisters
and that mother and that those
adventures and they so became part of
the the inner landscape of myself they
felt like
my memories so in a lot of ways it
didn ' t feel that different to me the
book had become part of me and I think
another reason why the little women feel
so personal to me is because of the very
existence of Louisa May Alcott who wrote
Little Women who kind of doubled herself
in the character of Joe and the distance
between what was real and what was false
was is emotional to me things like you
know she did have four sisters and and
they did they did struggle however in in
the book the March family are the
genteel poor and and in life the
Alcott ' s were wretchedly poor Louisa was
working by the time she was 14 she was
out sewing all day and she wrote stories
at night that she sold for almost
nothing and she taught herself to write
with those hands because when she got
home she could only write so long with
her right hand and it would bleed and
cramp that ' s not cute that ' s that ' s
serious and I think that kind of I think
there was something that I inherently
responded to about that distance and
then what I kind of did with my film in
terms of starting when they ' re adults
and then childhood becomes a thing that
you go back you you go back to because
it was the last time everyone was
together and that you were happy in this
way and you felt like anything was
possible and adults have more limited
options and I felt like if I could
somehow address that reflexivity and the
narrative of my film it both mirrors
what I go through because you ' re always
making something that ' s away from you
but part of you and then you know the
scene of her selling and trying to sell
a story III took that almost verbatim
from the book because you know I know
exactly I know exactly what that is to
sit in front of somebody and try to sell
them a story and they ' re telling me I
need to make changes and I ' m figuring
out how many changes I can make and
still live with myself but I need the
money
you know that ' s that ' s something I
understand and also these characters are
so close to me so I don ' t know I sort of
feel like I need a chart to explain that
but I think I mean it for so long
there ' s a sense in the studio
but they had to be you know we ' re making
films for male audience is that changing
I mean what ' s Hollywood right you know
like it ' s different filmmakers like
things like to if you have women tell
our own stories then it ' s changing
because it ' s our perspective you know
the way and we were talking about this
that like when people always ask like
what does it feel like to be a female
director and it ' s like I ' ve never driven
anything else in my life I don ' t I can ' t
compare the two I can ' t be like so it ' s
just a different perspective well I also
think that I ' m just wholesale stealing
this from Meryl Streep because she ' s
very smart and she said this to me I I
think it ' s hard to make a diagnosis in a
way because you know when you think
about the movies and the and the female
characters and the actresses in the in
the 30s and the 40s and the 50s and you
think about Carole Lombard and Rosalind
Russell and they have things that they
could do in films you know they ' re great
characters they they didn ' t invent them
yesterday
and but I Merrill ' s said this she said
well Rosalind Russell can come in and
yell at anyone and give him what for
because there ' s no actual tenth chance
she ' s gonna take his job like in this
day and age there ' s an actual chance
that you ' ll take their job so it becomes
less less inviting to have a woman come
in and give you what for if she ' s gonna
take your job and I was like well you ' re
just smarter than everyone Meryl Streep
can I say for years I was you know I get
a documentary on American cinema 20
years ago whatever and I did a whole
segment 15 12 to 15 minutes an Ida
Lupino oh you know and there ' s a woman
who you know is watched a hitchhiker
that the hitchhikers incredible a
bigamist and not wanted and so my thing
was that I never I wish sometimes you
take credits off a picture mmm
you know I looked at Archipelago Joanna
hogs film I had no I do is directed by
one of her movies are great yeah yes I
love with it I didn ' t know and then we
connected or whatever I wanted of
working and also the world has changed
you know it ' s it ' s post-world War two
long time now so everything changed and
the the trauma of the sixties and
seventies is the generations that even
remembered those films in the theater
are gone so this is the new world if it
different in Brazil but oh you ' re
dealing with a pretty reactionary well
mom work on being able to do my work but
for the bacillus cinema is a very tough
moment yeah he ' s really dis constructing
everything that we built in the last 15
years brazilian cinema i mean in the 90s
before a short city of god we were
producing like nine films a year last
year there was 150 so the industry
really boomed and TV industry already
also boomed but now he ' s really blocking
order you know he ' s been a difficult
moment what do you most like about the
filmmaking process and what you most
dislike I think a good set my like set
as well but I do most least to grab
things
quiet an experiment I mean like we
always say making it ' s the price you pay
to get to the editing script you change
the acting I think it ' s because
directors by their nature are control
freaks is what kind of leads us to this
and there ' s nowhere you have more
control than in the editing room there ' s
always these variables makes it fun my
set is fun casting a movie is fun
but it ' s a little out of control you get
to an editing room and you finally good
well I ' m trying to get control out of
control yes that ' s attention training
those horses you know that ' s the great
you must don ' t get an actress yeah it ' s
interesting to me I was thinking when
you all were talking how many and first
of all this tangent but I but it ' s so
interesting to me to watch people who
make films about face and in some ways I
feel like everyone here has made a film
about faith and I remember than that
anyway and sometimes it ' s directly about
phasic silence is directly about faith
you know but I do think it ' s um I think
we ' re always trying to if you give that
out anyway that ' s another I ' ll I ' ll
stink that thought later but Meryl say
well for me I like set and I like being
on set I mean III feel I feel very
deeply that movies are made in prep I
don ' t by the time you ' re on set it ' s too
late it ' s happening
I feel quite vividly that every second
you spend doing one thing is the second
you don ' t spend doing something else now
that ' s true for your entire life but I
feel it most vividly on a film set and
kind of always asking is it good enough
can you is it did you you never feel
like you got it but maybe it ' s gonna be
good enough and I I don ' t know whatever
the negotiation of time and art is it ' s
absurd to have a time to art form each
act but it ' s also beautiful because
we ' re all on a dreamer
exactly negotiating with yourself it ' s
not good but let ' s move on that ' s very
hard that ' s people it ' s the only art
form that exists with that there ' s you
actually have to get it done and not
when the Sun goes right because you ' re
never only day to do that happy because
you have that location with all the
hundreds of people there and I mean true
it ' s different
I mean deadlines are good too because
they get create it ' s good you want to
create print I mean weather where there
aren ' t parameters in filmmaking I think
we all kind of create our own rules
Giles do you want to have anything well
no I was gonna say about the faith thing
I what I love about production is it is
an act of faith you know every day you
show up on set is it gonna rain is it
gonna what ' s going to happen and then if
you know what you want to say like if
the circumstances aren ' t what you expect
you have to change what you were
expecting and you
to make the best out of that situation
and so many times you know when I look
back in seeing the final film I think oh
my gosh like this worked out so much
better than what I could have planned
for example I saw it in China at my
grandfather ' s grave you know my
grandfather died when I left right after
I left China I was six I had never saw
him again
and every time I went back it was just
to visit his grave and we shot a scene
in the cemetery and we couldn ' t get
permission to shoot at anyone else ' s
grave so I said let ' s shoot up my
grandfather ' s grave so we were there you
know and we were tech scouting and the
storm clouds are coming in and I stepped
away and I saw that you know people my
producers and this whole crew standing
around my grandfather ' s grave feel that
electricity like that ' s why I ' m a
filmmaker you know and that ' s is it
fiction is it autobiographical like it
kind of blends you know and it ' s just
magical no complicated was it shoot in
China it ' s funny because the film is
about like cultural differences and then
there were cultural differences on set
you know the way that people talk to
each other the hierarchy is different
you know getting to set people also
didn ' t call me by my name they just
called me director and you had to get
used to that it ' s very strange because
like then we shot in New York and I came
back and they were like what do you need
Lulu what like like director what can we
get the drugs and I had to learn like a
different language because sometimes my
DP and I would be saying we ' d just be
talking to each other and we ' d say I
don ' t know like I love the shot but that
tree is not great so like should we move
and we ' re like let ' s think about that we
turn around and I we turn back around
and somebody would be chopping down the
tree we were like what are you they were
like oh well someone ' s heard you saying
that the tree and you ' re like but I
didn ' t mean for okay well it ' s gone now
and I had to be careful from that point
on of what yeah it ' s happening
and you ' re like oh can you pass me that
thing and they ' re like oh no no that ' s
not the union says I can ' t no you can ' t
talk to her you gotta talk to no no I
mean that having an idea and it suddenly
when I was shooting the constant gunner
we were location scouting there was some
camels I said well would be nice if I if
you had some cameras and we just drove
by and then two months later the
producer called me for a meeting because
they ' re bringing camels from the ATO for
the whole set I said just a dusting a
dusting of the set okay the producers
came to me said Marty this is Italy they
think you ' re the biggest thing right
yeah they ' re bringing Matterhorn I mean
I did I realize all they ' re right okay
how tough do you have to be to be a
director do you have to be prepared to
make enemies do you have to be prepared
have people not like you I mean I used
to joke and say directing as you wake up
you have 42 fights and you go to bed
yeah but but you also have to have an
incredible amount of empathy with actors
and really understand what they ' re doing
and how they ' re putting themselves on
the line so yeah you have to be tough in
certain regard with the studio with with
with sometimes with the crew as far as
moving at the certain clip and all that
but you also have to have a great amount
of empathy yeah yeah so it ' s a mixture
and communication maybe it ' s about
clarity of so often especially shooting
in foreign countries it can be you were
saying this before leather some point
about it can be a miscommunication oh
yes you ' re fighting right and you think
you ' re being tough but it ' s like that
with all departments with you know I
haven ' t worked with the studio but with
producers so often you ' re fighting
it ' s really just about like oh you
didn ' t understand what I was trying to
do and what I was saying and you know
and sometimes you go what it ' s it ' s
because I say so and you can do that and
you can be tough but I find it works a
lot better if you say let me explain to
you why this is important yes yeah
exactly
it takes the time the thing I always say
they sometimes that ' s like don ' t ever
say to me but you said I ' m sure I did
say it but it ' s like but now and and I
find a lot of you know what you want to
create time to change your mind you know
you go in with this battle plan you ' ve
got all this stuff you know like you ' re
saying are you I mean if you prep
everything you go in there and then you
want to have the freedom to do what ' s
happening there and sometimes it ' s very
it matches up with what you brought in
and sometimes it doesn ' t at all and
usually bored I don ' t storyboard because
because I can ' t draw well enough and I
don ' t I don ' t like having another
barrier like bringing hiring somebody I
know I do I do i when I was a kid oh
well if the picture is and I kind of
imagine it here and if script depends
the script has to be open enough the
scenes have to be open up for us to
improvise if we need but there ' s certain
editing patterns we were talking about
that that ' s I I know have to be done
that way in a picture yeah and if the
film is unless day shooting I want to
make sure that goes now that goes over
here last summation of Christ we had no
time and it ' s okay Jesus in the desert
he comes in from frame left and they
said why frame but that ' s the way I
imagine a frame like it ' s frame left and
we ' re gonna move you know it could be
right I said but it ' s gonna be frame
left at this point because we have no
time you know and so then other times
there ' s some miraculous things that
happen I mean you talk about a lot of
things so Oh an irishman mmm oh just to
look I knew it the look of Bob and
Pacino when they ' re blue
jamas and that changed everything even
the entire crew we just got yeah
everything was very intimate and very
sweet well I haven ' t seen you but I like
when you said that I just remember
dinero in his pajamas and Casino and
thinking how that felt no this is
different 
[ Music ] 
did you mind about anything on Joker I
mean yeah all the time well you know I
just think it ' s it was just listening as
I ' m going yeah I mean making movies is
jazz it ' s not math it ' s not there ' s not
a there ' s not a little way to do it you
prep and you do but then you come in
like you said and it might just change
on the day when you say change anything
on Joker when we shoot we didn ' t do any
reading
I don ' t like reshooting I don ' t know why
it ' s never been a thing for me we try
and get it all yeah particular on this
movie we didn ' t because what King was
gonna keep the weight off for that much
longer we were there was no going yeah
that ' s why yeah
you know that scene where he ' s dancing
in the bathroom is scripted as an
entirely different scene and we went in
to shoot that scene that day and he ' s
supposed to go and he gets in he had
just done something cataclysmic in the
movie and then he goes into this little
rundown bathroom in a run-down park and
he it ' s gonna wash his makeup off and
hide the gun under a thing and we me and
Joaquim we ' re on the set and we just
like my ass doesn ' t really feel like the
Arthur we ' ve been filming now for four
or five weeks it doesn ' t seem like
Arthur what did he see this in a movie
why does he care to get rid of evidence
like it ' s just not him so we sat around
for 45 minutes while you know the crews
outside just thinking about other
possibilities and I ended up playing him
a piece of score from Hildur who is our
composer she had been sending me this
beautiful music and I just started
playing the score from off of my iphone
and he started doing this dance and we
just was like wait that ' s the scene they
call the operator even tell the operator
what we ' re doing I just said start on
foot yeah and played it off the phone
and that was it and it becomes a
transformation
well I that wasn ' t really
improvisational because we came true
creating you but having done a lot of
comedies
we leave it loose for him when you
mention that just jack I do it jest
directly yes so I have a plan when they
go to the set but then I mean whatever
happens I acted portunity I have to make
it different and change the script and
change it I was doing a movie with
Robert Downey jr . once and he turned to
me it feels like we ' re on the set of a
student film any minute as a compliment
because just like this very loose vibe
and I ' ve four comedies it ' s just what I
learned works for comedies but I
definitely carried it over with Joker
and I think Joaquin for a particular
actor I don ' t know that he would need
that on every movie but for this movie
that ' s what he needed he needed it to
feel like an exploration you can fight
anything on Mary story no in terms of
dialogue I mean the dialogue is all
scripted it ' s the overlaps are scripted
where people come in in the middle of
lines you know we block it all very
particularly but I for me I find by
creating these parameters that actually
gives what I think the actors would
refer to as improvisation because it ' s
not new lines but it ' s it ' s freedom its
its its freedom and and you know there ' s
a scene where they have a there ' s a
Levin Paige scene between Adam driver
and Scarlett Johansson ' s characters and
it starts slowly and it moves and and
that was something we rehearsed
extensively and blocked out extensively
but with their obviously with them I we
all all of it was both where I wanted to
move the camera how I wanted to edit it
the editing patterns when the close-ups
I knew I wanted certain movements on
cuts so I would say you know turn left
here when you say this line lunge
forward here it was actually inspired by
a last picture show the fight scene with
them Jeff Bridges it ' s the argument of
Jeff Bridges and Timothy bottoms when
there may be cuts within the line which
i think is in Touch of Evil 2 and then
the glass goes on the yeah but so all of
this was planned but what I knew within
this that these two actors were gonna
have to like really go there and they do
I mean I watch that scene and I feel
like I ' m watching their movie at times
because it ' s it ' s so
coming from them and so in that way it
feels totally like improv then that way
something actually Mike Nichols said
about acting he was saying he thought
about it when he used to do
improvisation with the with Elaine May
he said when you ' re improvising you ' re
never thinking about like what what
would my character do here Who am I
what ' s my backstory he ' s like you ' re
just so thrilled to have come up with
this idea right now and you just can ' t
wait to say and it ' s coming out right
and and and he said and I ' ve always
tried to get actors to the place with
dialogue where it has that same feeling
of it ' s right there and it ' s just you
know it ' s just coming out know you and
Greta or a couple
how does she influence your work how do
you influence hers I mean it ' s beyond
advice it ' s like the roots are she ' s in
there from the very beginning I mean
it ' s not things that we ' ve discussed
even about things we might want to write
together or other projects like
sometimes we ' ll end up like taking you
know Greta has lines and all my movie
you know but that are actually hers you
know
I mean maybe think she said in life but
also think she wrote you know that I say
can I use that you know cuz it ' s it ' s
yeah we ' re always sort of thinking about
things and so like somebody had asked me
is go has graduated great what was it
like sharing Greta marriage story for
the first time I was like I don ' t even
think of what the first time I mean
there was the first time but it was you
know I felt like she knew kind of what
she was going to see because of we were
so in it together all the time
similarly I mean know is my first reader
and then also when both was Lady Bird
and with Little Women I mean there would
be days where I would say can you watch
can you can you watch the dailies can
you just because I think I have the
thing can you look at this did I do you
think I should is this idea gonna work
or you know and and then he look at say
I mean it was I mean and it always will
be but it but it ' s being Noah and
relationship with no it ' s just it ' s in
the it ' s all the time and
and all the time I ' m like we ' ll see
something I mean the the I think he
talked about was you the when we saw
silence and there was the the moment of
the way you shot the scene where they ' re
talking to the Monsignor oh yes yes
anyway and he paused it and was like
it ' s actually it ' s great it ' s I ' m one of
the eye line teach person so Rico looked
at me said well that means we ' re gonna
have to go because of the two priests a
year and the money or the bishop is
there at the Cardinal whatever and you
jump the line on yeah but you go home on
signior two months ago left shoulder and
my right shoulder to Stephen it ' d be
like cutting between the two I ' m an
Irish you looked at me says this is
crazy I don ' t know yeah let ' s do it the
other way we looked at the other way is
terrible go back to and we got back to
the mistake which really a mistake was I
lived in marriage story I do this a few
times because the movie is all about
perspective is so much about perspective
and about who who are we with and so
when they ' re talking in the very
beginning in the movie to the mediator I
go the I did would do that exact thing
and I did it again in the courtroom it
was actually yesterday I asked Marty but
the the us if it was intentional I but I
had a feeling it felt in the best way
like kind of something that work because
I could have always cut through him I
mean there would be always the way it
wasn ' t interesting but on set unset is
where it happened and we looked at each
and said okay let ' s do this object
advice I think I know I think Spielberg
you gave me great notes I met him over
the course of a couple years ago but he
had the post and and I we were both
talking and I found him to be so
generous and interesting and and totally
willing to talk to me and I you know I
was gonna go prep Little Women and and
he ' d shot a Lincoln and it took place
the same year I mean it it ' s right the
same world and he opened up every
research he had done he had how he
decided to light things given that it
was all candle light how had he decided
when she shoot interiors he opens the
camera here she shut drastic park with
but he had me em smell sell you a
celluloid because he said you have to
shoot on film it ' s no it smells
different he ' s like you cannot shoot a
story that takes place in 1861 digitally
you just can ' t you I won ' t let you do it
and so I actually did end up shooting on
film and I and when Tom Rothman asked me
why I said I ' m Steven Spielberg had me
smell but then you know so I showed him
the film and he did what he did which is
so incredible is that he he talked to me
for a long time and what he did was he
gave it back to me
he talked through the film from his
memory and gave his notes as he
remembered the movie so it ' s almost like
he did the reverse back to me of giving
me back the movie and and he gave me you
know he ran different ideas by him and
he gave me and then he ' d give it back to
me he ' d say okay so what you ' re saying
is and then he he ' d explain it again to
me and it ' s just um it feels like such
an honor to be able to talk with someone
who ' s so thinks about how do we tell
stories and how do we bring people into
the stories and and and it ' s just it ' s
not one thing it ' s everything about how
you how you talk through and communicate
it and you know I think it maybe it
could I don ' t know I think maybe for
perhaps for all of you I don ' t know if
it was cinema or nothing I don ' t know
that it was cinema or nothing for me it
might have been theater or something
else but but it ' s a wonderful thing
fernanda with it nothing for you well
I ' m an architect
and before that I try it ' s real
biologists but when I was finishing
school I started making experimental
videos and you know video was just
coming out small you mathematic videos
and started doing some experimental
stuff from museums this kind of thing
and then I moved on to television and
and and then to film was
just surfing whatever was 17 I know you
one point thought of entering the
seminary yes I tried to what I was asked
to leave the one-year preparatory was
terrible it was only 15 years old I
didn ' t I realized when I got in there
this is a big commitment no one said
it ' s not about yourself as this idea of
how you how you give to other people
when you can be to other people I was
too young I didn ' t understand there was
this priest it was a mentor to me and he
was extraordinary man just passed away a
couple of years ago
and he wanted to be like him but you
can ' t you can ' t undergo try to try to
make a vocation calling because we want
to be like somebody you have to find
your own and there were working-class
people but you know we had no books in
the house there was not a reading
culture and we couldn ' t go to theater it
was too expensive so was always movies
and that hasma you know and so and the
streets were pretty tough Edie you make
it in the street or you know the church
wasn ' t bad st . Paxil Cathedral and I
found that they were talking about other
things that yeah I heard it in the
family
heard in the family but I found I found
that there was something else going on
there about um about compassion and
about what our lives are supposed to be
about and so I tried and but I found it
was channeled ultimately into I had no
choice uh basically I was obsessed with
the frame perforation by perforation do
you think do you see like making films
being an artist as a spiritual practice
in a way or as a leadership in a way an
artistic leadership yeah I ' ve said that
it I ' ve said that enough people oh it ' s
so pretentious and stuff but the point
is that if you work that way and you got
a gift let ' s say and you work is like a
prayer yeah someone you go to like its
brain you know yeah I had that I thought
actually I had like a little moment of
Revelation when I watched two Pope ' s
because first of all there ' s a quote in
there that says truth is vital but
without love it is unbearable
this is Benedict yes it is but I heard
it yeah because I didn ' t know that much
about his story until I saw the film and
then you know his whole philosophy of
like spiritual guidance how do you do it
from within a palace you know how do you
do it if you are up there separated from
the people right and and and he is part
of the people he says the carnival is
over so he doesn ' t want to wear the
costume he doesn ' t and it really made me
think cuz I ' m very new to all this you
know and this year I ' ve been like in
cars and hotels and like you know a team
of people suddenly around me and it ' s
like like literally six months ago I was
like good norm I was just like talk to
people some wanted to talk to me I just
talked to them and suddenly it ' s like
this kind of separation I ' ve been
dealing with it and I and when I watched
your movie I had this moment of
Revelation of like this is why this year
has actually been such a struggle
because how do I keep creating if I ' m
separated how do I you know we ' re trying
to figure out where to live and like
we ' re gonna move and get how I ' m like I
don ' t I don ' t want to live in the Hills
I don ' t want to live up there you know I
wanna live in a city I want to walk out
and be able to like talk to the Baker I
don ' t know it ' s a big test it ' s a test
to to you know you have to hold on to
the creativity how did I see what ' s more
what the value was in the creativity
they say wait you know I was out here
for 10 years and you know I found that I
found that you know friend got a car and
I had a car and then they got a nicer
car and then I understand that I went
this way making the films but the point
was that ultimately I can ' t see how you
could sink into a situation where you
think of the temporal issues you think
of a bigger house you think of a field
beyond to buy that house and what are
you gonna do with it you have to go back
to the creativity and protect that and
the only thing I could advise and maybe
under the circumstances now you know
lived with the the a special person kind
of situation but to facilitate you to
continue to focus because they help a
heart having a partner should say Lulu ' s
with Mary Jenkins is a director does
that help or hurt you with with your
current with with the artistic side of
your work it helps because I have the
support I don ' t think that anyone can
possibly know what we do and there are
so many women doing this to where I ' m
like you know I ' m not home I ' m not gonna
be home for months you know and are you
gonna be okay with that like not a
gender thing but I think few partners
would be okay with that you know and um
and but I do think it ' s specifically
with women it ' s it ' s even harder and so
it helps to have somebody who ' s been
through this who knows but we don ' t
collaborate in the way that you guys do
either there is a lot more separation
because you know we ' ve been together
maybe for less amount of time but but
also I like having that separation you
know I like having but you guys have had
a long working relationship you know as
well as being like romantic partners but
I think for me it ' s nice to have the
separation because because yeah we come
from two different worlds and it ' s also
nice to like have him be really fresh
eyes and also we ' re just different
people we approach things very
differently like being recently visit
this is too much information but we
recently got in a fight about where to
live and just like I ' ve been looking at
houses in the hills it was you didn ' t
ask me and he was like it ' s such a great
surprise right and he was like so
excited about it and I was like I don ' t
want to live in the Hills I want to live
with the people on the ground I ' m gonna
be in the city and he ' s like but then we
won ' t have a view you know those are the
things like it helps because we ' re
making yeah like it ' s so difficult like
it takes over your entire life what we
do you don ' t get to just go home at the
end of the night or on weekends you know
and and you don ' t get to stick to plans
that you ' ve made you know like so often
you ' re like I know you ' ve been sitting
in that restaurant for three hours but
I ' m still in the sound mixin it ' s our
final day and I ' ve you know if you say
that what can you just do it another day
can you just add another day well like
I ' ve been sitting here you know but he
gets that he ' s like oh it ' s your last
day like this is a small budget film
there ' s no way they ' re gonna go for it
I ' m good yeah I ' m just gonna keep
drinking yeah that is a huge thing that
you don ' t have to worry about when
you ' re stress out what moment
professionally has tested you the most
probably this what we ' ve gone through on
this picture you know with
was was pretty rough as as crazy as it
sounds again now through the media that
the movie is you know made to inspire
violence or to all the things that
really weren ' t in there for me in what
Kenan we were making the film there ' s no
need to be misunderstood before anybody
saw it so to me that was a great test of
just alright we ' ll just keep calm and
let the movie speak for itself when
people can finally see it I mean you
know when we premiered at Venice and we
had a great screening in Venice when the
golden line it was a huge deal from that
moment on everything changed weirdly you
know people come at it as a target and
start talking about again why it ' s
dangerous and really when we made a
movie about childhood drama and the loss
of compassion and lack of love and in a
person ' s life and what that might do but
everybody always wants to talk about the
the spark and not the powder but the
films really about the powder what makes
that happened you know but it ' s a much
easier and reductive way to just you
know so that for me I mean I ' m sure
there are other things but I ' m just
trying to tide in doesn ' t mean I went
through recently I wonder for Marty it
was last in tatius temptation I would
assume yeah you ' re right all right less
temptation sight unseen condemned by
very conservative elements a Christian
evangelicals which I have you know I ' m
Roman Catholic it ' s a different thing
and even then many many hierarchy of the
church condemned it without seeing it
although pope john paul ii on a plane
was asked to at least what does he think
of he said well i haven ' t seen the film
but I listen to my College of Cardinals
but in any event and still condemned it
or what no well it stayed condemned but
he didn ' t condemn it but Mike I don ' t I
don ' t know what he personally thought he
I don ' t think he saw the film but the
point is that it was really an attempt
to understand more about the issue of
faith really understand this concept of
the Incarnation one would like to get
into that sort of thing it is not the
place for it but the point is to really
explore and have an intelligent
conversation about a minute please
everybody I know that but by the time we
were I don ' t even think we even really
we could have edited for another month
or so but we stopped
in a way and we had to release the film
when all over the world went to Venice
but we didn ' t get presented in Venice
but out of competition and that was a
firestorm and in any event I really
really truly believed in it and still do
well it took me years later to find the
other way to go further and that was
silence to go deeper into it you know so
that what happens is that the
iconography of the Last Temptation is so
so you know it sets off people right
away better to go behind
sohow go around the iconography but I
wanted to tell the story that cousins
aqus wrote in the book it ' s just an idea
it ' s not based on the Bible it ' s not
based on New Testaments so in any event
it was a devastating it was dangerous
but in a funny way
something happened about a week before
it opened when I was watching all this
stuff go on I realize no it ' s not the
film isn ' t even important it ' s not
important it ' s about what ' s happening
now and it saddened me but it made me
realize maybe art is important but
there ' s something beyond that you know
and that ' s what I had to deal with in
myself really well I had some fools of
four years and collapsed but I think the
hardest thing was that I directed the
opening of the Olympic ceremony in Rio
in 2016 with two friends and I had never
directed some life and it ' s not even
theatre so there was a really big
challenge I have to talk about my
country to the whole world like three
billion viewers that was so during this
process I managed to director an opera
something life to see how to play and
the budget was going down down down from
from the beginning to be able to like
ten times less money this was
challenging but they ' re definitely
creatively I think there were scenes in
marriage story there was there was that
where I felt usually the separation I
can feel as a director from from the
emotional content of a scene I felt that
I actually had to stop and I mean they
had to stop it I also had to stop and
take walks around
the block and like shake it off in a way
that I haven ' t had before on a set where
I usually feel at that point you know
with all the planning I think I can be
moved by with something in actors doing
I am all the time but but it feels in
the movie in a way I ' m responding you
know this felt something like there was
there was thought of I felt a real
responsibility there I all of mine are
petty like people telling me without me
asking that they didn ' t like my movie it
wasn ' t no no I mean no truly for me you
know I saw I so badly wanted to be part
of making making movies and making
making art and when you feel like oh how
am I ever gonna get to that how is that
ever gonna work out that those are the
those are the moments that ' s mine to
really well when I was trying to make
the farewell American producers said
this is not an American film it ' s a
maybe a Chinese film you should maybe go
talk to Chinese investors I went and
talked to Chinese investors and they
said Chinese people are not gonna get it
if your main character has this Western
point of view right and so and then both
sides were like but we would be
interested in making it if you change
these elements if you made it funnier
for you if you brought home a form
American boyfriend who didn ' t know I ' ve
used top six and everyone could laugh
you know and and - what Gretta was
saying earlier it ' s almost like I feel
like my whole life subconsciously I ' ve
gotten used to compromising and it ' s not
even a question it ' s just you get used
to it cuz you go that ' s the only way to
get something made the question is just
how far and still keep my sanity and
still keep some semblance of what I ' m
trying to say and it and so I didn ' t
make the film because I couldn ' t get it
set up but I ended up doing that this
particular story for this American life
and that happened very quickly it would
you know it ' s a bunch of journalists and
they said this story is so interesting
it ' s fact
so they asked a bunch of questions we
did a bunch of interviews and I recorded
I narrated the whole story I was in a
studio in New York by myself at 10 p . m . 
with my producer and into a microphone
with some whiskey and and then I went
out for dinner after with my friend and
we were celebrating but I started
sobbing I started crying because I said
it was like what ' s going on your story ' s
gonna be heard you know within 48 hours
by so many people and you finally get to
tell your story and I said I ' ve never
experienced that kind of purity of
storytelling before uncompromised where
someone just said what ' s your story and
tell me how that made you feel and tell
me what happened as opposed to how do we
change it to work for the marketplace
and now that I ' ve experienced it I ' ve
realized that for the last 10 years I ' ve
been in the wrong industry I ' ve been so
focused on the goal of like just you
know proving to my parents that I could
do it and I can like make a living doing
it that I don ' t fit in in this industry
because they tell me that I have to find
my voice that ' s the way to become a
great filmmaker but the industry doesn ' t
want my voice and why am I doing this
like it takes so much money so much time
so much energy and you know with this
American life reaches like four million
people in two weeks and it ' s my voice
literally into the microphone isn ' t that
more powerful isn ' t that more so you go
to abandon filmmaking yeah really
I wanted to abandon filmmaking and I
asked iron then they said that they were
interested in potentially having me do
an internship for six months and I was
gonna leave to go work for public radio
because I also got paid more on public
radio than I ever did in film for you
know one month of work and 48 hours
later after the story aired producers
called and asked me to make the film and
it was because I had this change of this
realization that I was ready to leave
that when they called I said I ' m not
gonna make it unless I can make it the
same way that I made the story for this
American life and I ' m not even gonna
take the meeting unless they agree I ' m
not changing the cast I ' m not changing
the way I ' m
the language I don ' t care what the
budget is I just need enough budget to
make the film to go to China to shoot
there to cast people but yeah and and
that was how I picked my partners and
that was the thing that drove me the
entire project every decision that I
fought for it was going back to that
feeling in the studio of being an
uncompromised storyteller and every time
I got really difficult going back to one
of the things that Barry really helped
me with he was he would say that a great
film is made in the last 10% and so
every time you feel that you ' re stuck
just think another 10% so it became like
a joke because every time I ' d be like
just two more frames just and they were
like is this your 10% you know my editor
would say that everyone would say that
but I and now I truly believe that it
was because I pushed that just like
millimeters centimeters and that ' s how
you make it look good
