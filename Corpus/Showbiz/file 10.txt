Changing fashion : The clothing and textile industry at the brink of radical transformation
Environmental rating and innovation report by WWF Switzerland 2017 September 2017

Executive summary
The clothing and textile industry offers style and 
functionality . It sells dreams and provides a stage for 
self-expression . But the industry produces an 
environmental impact which is far from sustainable . 
Looking at the environmental challenges in this 
sector , WWF is asking : How will fashion brands 
fulfil customers ’ dreams in the future while 
contributing to the well-being of society and the 
environment at large ? 
Doing ‘ business as usual ’ will not be an option for the 
industry nor for the planet in the long run . To stay 
financially successful , companies will find it 
necessary to reduce their environmental impact and 
to respect the ecological boundaries of our planet . 
WWF ’ s vision is that the clothing and textile industry 
contributes to a world in which humans live in 
harmony with nature . There is a long way to go to 
make this vision come true , but WWF believes it to 
be possible , if the industry takes bold action and 
leadership for transformation . 
This report shows how frontrunners are improving 
the environmental performance of their value chain , 
and how they are adopting innovative business 
models which could reduce the sector ’ s impact on 
the environment drastically . These innovations , in 
combination with disruptive global mega-trends such 
as digitalization , indicate that the clothing and textile 
industry is at the brink of radical transformation . It is 
time to use these transformative dynamics to create 
a radically different and more sustainable clothing 
and textile industry . 
Being far from sustainable is an ecological 
and financial risk
The clothing and textile industry has an ecological footprint which is far from sustainable . The 
industry emits 1 . 7 billion tonnes of CO2
annually , is responsible for extensive water 
use and pollution , and produces 2 . 1 billion 
tonnes of waste annually , to name just a few 
aspects . 1
Global consumption of clothes doubled between 2000 and 2014 . 2 Today , on a global 
average , every person buys 5kg of clothes per 
year , but in Europe and the USA the figure is as 
high as 16kg . 3 Overall apparel consumption is 
projected to rise even further , from 62 million 
tonnes in 2015 to 102 million tonnes in 2030 . This 
projected increase in global fashion consumption 
will create further environmental stress and 
risks . 4
Environmental impacts should furthermore be of 
financial concern to brands . A recent study by the 
Boston Consulting Group indicates that brands ’ 
profit margins could fall by at least 3 percentage 
points by 2030 due to rising costs for labour , raw 
materials and energy , if companies continue with 
business as usual . This would add up to approximately €45 billion per year of lost profits for the 
industry . 5
Changing fashion : The clothing and textile industry at the brink of radical transformation
Environmental rating and innovation report by WWF Switzerland 2017 September 2017

WWF sees three areas for leadership : 
1 . Environmental efficiencies : The clothing and textile industry improves its most material environmental 
performance ( e . g . water use and pollution , climate protection , chemicals )  . 
2 . Innovation and transformation : The industry reinvents its business models , with the aim of decoupling the 
industry ’ s expected growth from resource use and negative environmental impacts . 
3 . Sustainable consumption : Consumers find creative solutions to reduce their consumption of clothes , share or 
swap clothes , and buy mindfully , without compromising their desire for style and self-expression .

Environmental rating of 12 brands pinpoints 
areas of improvement
The report presents a rating of 12 major brands , 
based on data provided by oekom research AG . The 
results show that none of the surveyed companies 
was ranked in the highest classification of ‘ visionary ’  . 
H & M was classified as ‘ ambitious ’  ; Nike , adidas and 
Mammut were ranked in the ‘ upper midfield ’  ; 
VF Corporation ( e . g . The North Face , Timberland )  , 
Hugo Boss , Odlo and Calida ended up in the ‘ lower 
midfield ’  ; and Triumph , Chicorée , PKZ and Tally 
Weijl were classified in the ‘ latecomers / 
intransparent ’ group – meaning they take very limited 
action regarding environmental issues , or do not 
disclose any information . 
WWF harnessed the corporate ratings of oekom 
research AG and used the environmentally relevant 
sections of those ratings for purposes of this report . 
These sections focus on 11 environmental topics 
WWF considered most relevant for this report – such 
as climate change , water use and pollution , raw 
materials and stakeholder engagement . The rating 
focuses on environmental topics only since this is 
WWF ’ s area of expertise . The brands of various 
sizes were selected from different segments of the 
clothing and textile industry , such as premium 
market , discount market and outdoor / athletic wear . 
The more detailed results show that more than half 
the companies have not taken any steps at all to 
counter climate change , which is concerning . There 
are also significant gaps regarding the use of 
sustainable raw materials , the use of water , and the 
prevention of water pollution and hazardous 
substances . However , the results also show that 
frontrunners of the industry use scientific tools and 
take action for sound environmental management . 
The report calls upon companies to make 
improvements in the following material aspects :  ( 1 ) 
Strategy to operate within the planet ’ s ecological 
boundaries ,  ( 2 ) climate change ,  ( 3 ) water 
management and stewardship ,  ( 4 ) raw materials ,  ( 5 ) 
joint environmental management in the supply chain ,  
( 6 ) chemicals management ,  ( 7 ) investment , 
stakeholder engagement and responsibility for public 
policy , and ( 8 ) new business models to decouple
consumption from resource use .

Transformational change and innovation for 
sustainability
To meet the challenges of the future , the clothing 
and textile industry will need to take bold action for 
transformational change and innovation . Or , as Nike 
puts it :  “ What becomes abundantly clear is 
efficiencies alone will not suffice – for Nike , or the 
world . The world needs systemic change at scale . 
We must innovate .  ” 
6
Improving efficiencies will 
neither be enough to operate within planetary 
boundaries nor to achieve the Sustainable 
Development Goals by 2030 . 
This report shows examples of how frontrunners in 
the industry invest in process , product and business 
model innovations . Searching for and promoting 
innovation to transform long-established , 
unsustainable business practices are essential . 
A few brands and start-ups aspire to invent new 
business models that have the potential to radically 
transform the industry towards one that operates 
within the Earth ’ s carrying capacity . These firstmovers are pulling the industry away from its linear 
 ‘ make-sell-dispose ’ approach towards more circular 
business models . The report draws attention to 
business model innovations in the area of reduction , 
repair , reuse , sharing and recycling , but also to 
product innovations ( e . g . more sustainable fibres ) 
and innovative processes . 
Consumers find creative solutions to reduce the 
industry ’ senvironmental impact
This report has also gathered creative ideas on how 
consumers can contribute to reducing the 
industry ’ s environmental impact . To have a 
positive impact , consumers could , for example : 
- Buy less 
- Simplify their style and wardrobe , for 
example by using timeless , high-quality 
clothes and enriching those with 
accessories and second-hand items
- Wash , care for and repair their clothes
- Buy second-hand clothes , swap or rent their 
outfits , or bring them to a recycling facility
- Buy organic , green and high quality items
- Use their voice to inform friends , to provide 
feedback to their preferred brands , to vote 
on relevant public policy , and to support 
non-governmental organizations . 
This report – together with follow-up reports for 
tracking of progress – should be seen as an 
encouraging and constructive contribution to the 
sector ’ s transformation towards sustainability . WWF 
will repeat this rating in two to three years to track 
progress . This report is only one piece in a whole 
range of activities that the WWF network is carrying 
out in the clothing and textile industry .

Far from sustainable Brands and retailers in the clothing industry offer style and functionality , 
sell dreams and strongly influence our beliefs and behaviours . And they 
produce an ecological footprint which is far from sustainable . According to 
estimates , the clothing and textile industry emits 1 . 7 billion tonnes of CO2
annually and is therefore a significant contributor to global warming . 7
It 
increases local water impacts due to water pollution and the high 
volumes of water required for growing raw materials and wet processing . 
The textile industry uses a lot of toxic chemicals , particularly in 
processing , which often leads to severe damage to water basins , soil and 
biodiversity . 8
In addition , the industry produces 2 . 1 billion tonnes of waste
such as disposed clothing or off-cuts each year , of which only 20 per cent 
is recycled . 9
The environmental pressure is exacerbated by the fact that consumption 
of clothes increases year by year and that consumers keep their garments 
only about half as long as they did 15 years ago . Global consumption of 
clothes doubled between 2000 and 2014 . 10 Today , on a global average , 
every person buys 5kg of clothes per year , but in Europe and the USA the 
figure is as high as 16kg . 11 Overall apparel consumption is projected to 
rise even further , from 62 million tonnes in 2015 to 102 million tonnes in 
2030 . 12 This projected increase in global fashion consumption will create 
further environmental stress : by 2030 , the global clothing and textile 
industry is expected to use 50 per cent more water , emit 63 per cent more 
greenhouse gases ( GHGs )  , and produce 62 per cent more waste , 
compared to 2015 . 13
Environmental impacts should also be of financial concern to brands . A 
recent study by the Boston Consulting Group indicates that brands ’ profit 
margins could fall by at least 3 percentage points by 2030 due to rising 
costs for labour , raw materials and energy , if companies continue with 
business as usual . This would add up to approximately €45 billion per year 
of lost profits for the industry . 14 Another study indicated that if the Danish 
apparel sector paid the entire externalized costs of indirect land-use 
change , water consumption , air and water pollution and GHG emissions , 
the total costs would be equivalent to 11 . 7 per cent of total revenue for the 
sector . As the average profit for the sector in 2012 was 6 per cent of 
revenue , integrating the environmental footprint would result in the sector 
operating at a net loss . 15
Due to these challenges in the clothing and textile industry WWF is asking : 
How will fashion brands fulfil customers ’ dreams in the future while 
contributing to the well-being of society and the environment at
large ?

Vision : to build a 
future in which 
people live in 
harmony with nature
WWF ’ s vision is to stop the degradation of the planet ' s natural 
environment and to build a future in which people live in harmony with 
nature . In the case of the clothing and textile industry , this means 
considering the ecological boundaries of our planet and its limited 
resources . WWF ’ s Living Planet Report demonstrates that we ’ re 
consuming nature ’ s resources and services as if we had 1 . 6 Earths at our 
disposal . In addition , research suggests that we ’ ve already crossed four of 
nine “ Planetary Boundaries ” – safe thresholds for critical Earth system 
processes that maintain life on the planet ( see figure 3 )  . 
16 The Planetary 
Boundaries concept , defined by researchers from the Stockholm 
Resilience Centre , 17 describes an environmentally safe operating space 
for human activity . There are various concepts that refer to living within the 
planet ’ s ecological limits .

The clothing and textile industry needs to find a modus operandi which 
allows it to respect the ecological boundaries of our planet and its limited 
resources , for example regarding climate change , biochemical flows , 
freshwater use and pollution . This would enable the clothing and textile 
industry to contribute to a future in which humans live healthy lives in 
harmony with nature , without overusing resources or polluting more than 
the planet can take . This approach would also take the industry , and the 
world , closer to achieving the universal Sustainable Development Goals
by 2030 . There is a long way to go to make this vision come true , but 
WWF believes it to be possible , if the industry and related stakeholders 
take bold and ambitious steps for transformation . 
This Report This report by WWF Switzerland – together with follow-up reports for 
tracking of progress – should be seen as an encouraging and constructive 
contribution to the sector ’ s transformation towards operating within the 
ecological boundaries of our planet . It is only one piece in a whole range 
of activities the global WWF network is carrying out in the clothing and 
textile industry ( see box 1 on page 11 for some examples )  . 
The report is structured as follows . Chapter 1 provides an overall picture of 
the clothing and textile industry . It explores the sector ’ s value chain , 
market developments , dynamics and trends , and puts them into relation to 
the key environmental impacts of the sector . Chapter 2 describes the 
results of an environmental performance benchmark , based on data 
provided by oekom research AG . Chapter 3 explores how innovations by 
the sector can lead to transformational change and to becoming future fit 
as an industry . The report demonstrates how innovation can lead to more 
sustainable products , processes and even business models . Finally , 
chapter 4 provides recommendations for sustainable consumer behaviour . 
Figure 4 : This report 
This report focuses on environmental issues , and does not address social 
aspects and labour rights . While WWF acknowledges the importance of 
social matters and the devastating and unacceptable conditions many 
employees in parts of the clothing and textile industry are suffering from , 
our expertise lies in improving the environmental impacts of the sector . 
Organizations like the International Labour Organization , the Fair Wear 
Foundation and the Clean Clothes Campaign are dedicated to 
improving working conditions and supporting the empowerment of workers 
in the global clothing and textile industries . WWF strongly supports their 
efforts .

BOX 1 : WWF ’ s engagement with the clothing and textile industry
WWF has a long-standing history of engagement with the clothing and textile industry and takes various 
measures to help transform this sector towards a more sustainable modus operandi . Our approach is to cocreate science-based and innovative solutions , which lead to positive impacts : 
Transformational partnerships . The global WWF network partners with major apparel and textiles companies to improve their environmental performance . WWF and its partner companies set ambitious environmental targets and jointly implement projects along the supply chain . We undertake comprehensive due diligence 
processes , which include social issues , before collaborating with a company . Current partner companies of 
the global WWF network include H & M , Levi Strauss , Marks & Spencer and others . 
Promotion of more sustainable cotton . WWF is a co-founder of the Better Cotton Initiative ( BCI )  , publishes an annual sustainable cotton ranking report in collaboration with Pesticide Action Network UK and 
Solidaridad , and is also involved in organic cotton acceleration projects , for example in India and Pakistan . 
Water stewardship . WWF ’ s water stewardship approach supports brands in setting holistic strategic responses to water , and supporting local-level collective action for water governance in many key textile production regions . For example , WWF and H & M have been working together since 2011 on water stewardship , 
which makes H & M ’ s own operations and value chain cleaner and more water efficient , and brings companies , 
governments , NGOs and communities together to share water resources in a more sustainable way . Furthermore , WWF offers a water risk filter and has recently published a report on imported water risks . 
Science-based targets . The Science Based Targets Initiative is a joint initiative by CDP , UN Global Compact , World Resource Institute and WWF . It supports companies in setting GHG emission reduction targets 
consistent with the level of decarbonization required by science to limit global warming to less than 1 . 5°C / 2°C 
compared to pre-industrial temperatures . Companies that have already set or are committed to sciencebased targets include Kering , asics and Puma . Guidance on sectoral decarbonization approaches for 
the apparel industry has recently been launched . 
Roundtables and initiatives . WWF is contributing its expertise to various roundtables and initiatives 
within the textile industry . For example , we are an active member of the Sustainable Apparel Coalition , which focuses on building the Higg Index , a a suite of tools , which brands , retailers and manufacturers 
can use to assess the sustainability impacts of their entire value chains and identify areas for improvement . 
Changing consumer behaviour . We engage with customers of our partner companies and the public to 
raise awareness and to inspire change .

A global industry 
with a highly 
complex supply chain
The global clothing industry is worth US$2 . 4 trillion in value . 18 Countries
like Bangladesh , China , India , Turkey , Pakistan and Vietnam are top
supplying countries of garments for the global clothing and textile
markets . 19 Some countries are extremely dependent on the clothing
industry . For instance , in Bangladesh it accounts for about 80 per cent of
total export earnings and generates over 4 million direct jobs . 20
The clothing and textile industry is built on a complex and diversified value 
chain including many actors : raw material manufacturers , fibre and fabric 
producers , wet processers , garment assembly companies , brands , 
retailers , consumers , and disposal / recycling agents ( see figure 5 on page 
14 )  . 
Clothes are made from natural fibres , chemical fibres or a mix of both . 
Around a third of fibres used for clothing are natural fibres such as cotton , 
wool , silk , flax , hemp and jute ; the other two-thirds are synthetic fibres 
such as polyester , nylon , polyamide , acrylic and polypropylene , or natural 
polymers like viscose , acetate and modal . 21

Significant 
environmental 
impacts
The clothing and textile sector faces many sustainability issues along the 
supply chain . 22 The four most pressing environmental impacts – energy 
use and greenhouse gas emissions , water use , pollution through 
chemicals and microplastics , and waste – are described in more detail 
below . 
Energy use and greenhouse gas emissions . According to estimates , 
the clothing and textile industry emits 1 , 7 billion tonnes of CO2 annually 
and is therefore a significant contributor to global warming . 
23 This 
contribution to global GHG emissions is alarming , particularly when taking 
into account that the level of atmospheric CO2 already today exceeds the 
safe human operating space by 20 per cent . 
24 There are several GHG
emission hotspots in the apparel supply chain , particularly the processing 
phase , the washing and drying of garments by consumers and the 
production of raw materials . 25
Water use , water quality and water basin risks . The clothing and textile 
industry uses high volumes of water , particularly in raw material production 
like cotton growing , in dyeing and wet processing stages , and during the 
use phase by consumers . It is estimated that growing one kilogram of 
cotton needs up to 20 , 000 litres of water , depending where and how it is 
grown . 26 The World Bank estimates that 20 per cent of industrial water 
pollution comes from textile dying and treatment . 27 Water use and pollution 
lead to increased environmental stress at the water basin level , particularly 
in apparel producer countries such as India and China , which are already 
suffering from medium or high levels of water stress and water pollution . 28
Use of chemicals and microplastics . The production of fabrics requires 
different kinds of harmful chemicals , which can be toxic and cause 
damage to the environment as well as the workforce . Chemicals are used 
throughout the apparel supply chain both in natural fibre production 
( pesticides ) and in the production of final garments ( e . g . dyes and 
colourants , detergents , water or stain repellents , performance enhancing 
coatings , fire retardants )  . 29 Conventional cotton accounts for 24 per cent of 
global sales of insecticides and 11 per cent of all pesticides . 30 Clothing 
made from polyester poses an as yet unknown threat to the oceans and 
eventually to the planet . When washing these clothes , microplastic fibres 
are released , which find their way to the oceans . According to a recent 
study by IUCN , 
31 clothes and textiles are the number one source of 
primary microplastic to the oceans , accounting for around 35 per cent of 
the global total . 32
Waste . Currently 80 per cent of all clothing produced ends up in 
incinerators or landfill , and only 20 per cent is recycled . 33 The US 
Environmental Protection Agency estimates that textile waste occupies 
nearly 5 per cent of all landfill space . 34 However , one challenge is that , 
globally , collection rates for clothes are very low . Germany outperforms 
most countries in recycling by collecting almost 75 per cent of all used 
clothing . But elsewhere the collection rates are far lower : 15 per cent in 
the United States , 12 per cent in Japan and 10 per cent in China . 35
Another challenge when trying to reduce waste is that methods of 
recycling old clothes such as shredding or chemical digestion have their 
limitations in terms of costs and lowered quality . Several companies invest 
a lot in research and development of recycled clothes . However , design 
for disassembly and circularity , as well as quality issues , are yet to be fully 
addressed . H & M , for example , says the company can only mix 20 per cent
of recycled cotton fibres into new clothes at the moment for quality 
reasons . 36

BOX 2 : Key market trends
To transform markets , it is important to understand market trends that are drivers of or barriers to sustainable
transformation of the industry . For example , the importance of brand value and reputational risks could encourage brands to strive for more sustainable products , which can be used as a competitive advantage in
marketing campaigns . Automation and digitalization will force brands to innovate their business models – this
could , ideally , be used to drive more sustainable business models . However , the fast-fashion trend and population growth could put further pressure on natural resources and hence counter the ambition of a more sustainable fashion industry . Relevant key industry trends are summarized below : 
Competitive market . Brands and clothing retail companies are in a highly competitive market ; they try to
maintain and grow their market share through intensive marketing campaigns . Due to low requirements for
initial capital investment there are numerous new brands and market entrants . Substitutes such as homemade
clothes or second-hand clothing are currently a negligible threat to the established market players . 37
E-commerce , social media and big data . Online and mobile technologies are significantly shifting the way
consumers purchase apparel and textile products . To respond to this trend , established and new apparel retailers are developing their online capabilities and analysing big data to predict new trends . 38
Sales and profitability . The sector is characterized by high volatility , low predictability and low profit margins . 
A trend towards more and more discounts to attract consumers has led to lowered profit margins for stores . 
Volatile raw material prices , particularly of natural fibres due to their dependency on good weather conditions , 
have a significant impact on profitability . 39
Fast fashion . Fashion products move increasingly fast from the design to the store , which is reshaping the
product life-cycle as well as production patterns in the sector . In 2000 , the average store had only two collections per year . Currently , the market average is around five , but can be as high as 12-16 ( H & M ) or even 24 
( Zara )  . By compressing production cycles and turning out up-to-the-minute designs , fast-fashion businesses
have enabled shoppers not only to expand their wardrobes but also to refresh them quickly . Consumers keep
clothing items about half as long as they did 15 years ago , 40 and global consumption of clothes doubled between 2000 and 2014 . 41
Population growth and growing middle class . Demand for textile and apparel products is fuelled by population growth and the rising middle class in emerging economies . 42 The Boston Consulting Group has estimated
that overall apparel consumption will rise from 62 million tonnes in 2015 to 102 million tonnes in 2030 . 43
Automation , digitalization and technology . Garment and textile production is characterized by low-skill and 
labour-intensive production that requires routine and manual tasks . Studies estimate that up to 88 per cent of 
these jobs could be at risk of automation . The use of 3D printing and robotics could potentially disrupt the industry and its complete value chain . 44

Benchmark of 
12 brands
To incentivize the sector towards strong environmental performance , 
WWF Switzerland has assessed and compared the environmental 
stewardship of 12 major brands . The rating is based on data provided by 
oekom research AG and considers a comprehensive set of environmental 
issues such as GHG emissions , water use and pollution , chemicals 
management , waste , and others . 
In this environmental rating , none of the surveyed companies managed 
to achieve the highest classification of ‘ visionary ’  . H & M was ranked as 
 ‘ ambitious ’  ; Nike , adidas and Mammut as ‘ upper midfield ’  ; and 
VF Corporation ( e . g . The North Face , Timberland )  , Hugo Boss , Odlo and 
Calida as ‘ lower midfield ’  . Triumph , Chicorée , PKZ and Tally Weijl were 
ranked in the ‘ latecomers / intransparent ’ group ( Figure 6 )  . These findings 
are in line with those of other studies . A recent study by Boston Consulting 
Group and Global Fashion Agenda , for example , indicates that over half of 
the industry has shown little effort so far . 45

BOX 3 : About the rating
The selection of brands reflects the following aims :  ( 1 ) analysing brands from different segments such as 
premium market , discount market and outdoor / athletic wear ;  ( 2 ) looking at brands of various sizes ;  ( 3 ) 
including the most relevant clothing companies headquartered in Switzerland , based on turnover . Together , 
these brands represent approximately 5-8 per cent of the global clothing market . 
The aim of WWF Switzerland ’ s first rating of the clothing and textile industry is to serve as a baseline study 
for WWF ’ s vision for a more sustainable clothing and textile industry . WWF would like to see significant 
improvements towards operating within the ecological limits of our planet , and is keen to encourage and 
collaborate with companies to foster progress in line with one planet thinking . The aim is to include more 
clothing and textile brands in the future . By regularly repeating the rating , we aim to pinpoint areas for 
possible improvement , enable monitoring of future improvements and track progress . 
The rating is based on data provided by the internationally renowned sustainability rating agency oekom 
research AG . oekom research AG used their standard rating methodology for the clothing and textile sector . 
To build up a comprehensive picture of companies , oekom ’ s analysts collected information both from the 
companies and from other sources such as media , research institutes and NGOs . At the time of the initial 
compilation of the rating , the companies were given the opportunity to comment on and add to the findings . 
H & M , Nike , adidas , Mammut , Hugo Boss , Triumph and PKZ provided feedback during the rating process and 
supplemented the draft rating with additional internal company information . 
oekom research AG has benchmarked 
companies against approximately 100 criteria . 
One-third of the criteria were sector-specific , 
while two-thirds were general ones which could 
be applied to any sector . Out of the criteria 
provided on each company by oekom research 
AG , WWF selected almost 60 that were 
relevant to the company ’ s environmental 
performance . The data used for this report was 
compiled or last updated between late 
February and early May 2017 . 
oekom research AG attributed a weighting to 
the different criteria , depending on the environmental impact of the specific topics in the 
context of the textiles and apparel industry . 
The criteria concerned with raw materials and 
manufacturing processes , for example , are 
underlined with a higher weighting than 
transport and travel .

Results of the 
environmental rating 
Figure 8 shows how the 12 selected companies were rated in 11 areas 
relevant for a comprehensive environmental management . The following 
key points can be drawn from the detailed analysis of data provided by 
oekom research AG on the surveyed brands in the clothing and textile 
industry . 
Figure 8 : Rating results per section
The criteria and rating results are explored and discussed in more detail in 
appendix I . Furthermore , WWF Switzerland has conducted an in-depth 
analysis of the companies ’ support of relevant public policy in Switzerland . 
The findings of this public affairs analysis are displayed in appendix II . 
In summary , the data provided by oekom research AG shows the 
following : 
Overall environmental management . Overall , the clothing and textile 
industry does not perform well in environmental management . Only a few 
of the surveyed leading brands have taken ambitious or visionary action in 
selected areas . The rating also shows a large spread of environmental 
performance among companies , with some of them taking ambitious 
action , and others showing no or very little effort towards serious 
environmental management . Most of the brands , particularly smaller ones 
with limited geographical reach , take no or very limited action to manage 
their environmental footprint .

21
Raw materials , water use and hazardous substances . Raw materials , 
as well as water use and use of hazardous substances in manufacturing , 
are important topics in the textile industry , so are given a greater weighting 
in the overall rating . There are significant gaps and concerns related to 
criteria in these important aspects of environmental management . 
Climate change . More than half of the surveyed companies have taken 
no or very limited steps to counter climate change . Considering the 
influence of the clothing and textile industry on climate change discussed 
above , this finding is concerning . 
Scientific tools and eco-efficiency measurement . The uptake of 
scientific tools and eco-efficiency data collection in the industry is slow . 
While some companies show efforts in this regard , only one company is 
committed to the thorough use of environmental assessment tools in 
product design . Some first-moving companies monitor and manage ecoefficiency of their own operations ( e . g . stores ) and of their first-tier 
suppliers . Only few companies , e . g . H & M , implement measures in their 
extended supply chain and also collect relevant eco data at suppliers 
beyond tier 1 . 
Transparency and stakeholder dialogue . Particularly among companies 
in the lower midfield and ‘ intransparent / latecomers ’ category , there is a 
lack of reporting and transparency , and an apparent lack of commitment to 
ambitious action . This is undesirable for the environment , but also for 
consumers , investors , communities , political bodies , and other 
stakeholders . Furthermore , it is a major economic and reputational risk for 
the industry itself .

Call to action The rating revealed that , out of the sample , large companies such as 
H & M , Nike and adidas , as well as the Swiss-based medium-sized 
company Mammut , are taking important steps towards reducing the 
industry ’ s environmental footprint . However , none of the companies 
assessed in this rating was classified as ‘ visionary ’  . From an NGO and 
environmental perspective , this is not good enough . We call upon 
companies in the clothing and textile industry to take more 
determined action towards better environmental management and to 
align their business models with the limits of the planet . 
The different market positions provide the companies in question with 
various levers to shape an environmentally sustainable development of 
the clothing and textile industry . However , each company can contribute 
significantly within its own sphere of influence , be it on a national or global 
level , to a highly specific issue or to the general discourse , as well as 
alone or in conjunction with its customers , suppliers and competitors . 
Based on the results of this rating , the following general recommendations 
can be made to the industry : 
1 . Strategy to operate within the planet ’ s 
ecological boundaries . Environmental policies , 
strategies and targets should be determined 
based on scientific concepts and should be 
designed to respect the planet ’ s ecological 
boundaries and limited natural resources . 
Science-based targets ( see below ) address this 
in the context of climate change . 46 Similar targetsetting methods for other boundaries such as 
freshwater use still need to be developed , but 
early concepts such as context-based water 
targets47 can be taken into consideration . 
2 . Climate change . Companies should contribute 
to combating climate change and implementing 
the 2016 Paris Agreement by setting sciencebased targets in line with keeping global 
warming to 1 . 5°C / 2°C . Well over 200 companies 
worldwide have set or are committed to sciencebased targets . A few of them stem from the 
clothing and textile industry such as Kering , 
asics and Puma . 48
3 . Water management and stewardship . Brands 
need to understand the areas of highest risk and 
impact on water , and work with raw material 
producers and suppliers in the wet processing 
stage to reduce their impacts on local water 
systems for both quality and quantity . In these 
water-related supply chain hotspots , companies 
should implement water-saving technologies , 
reduce water pollution , apply best practice in 
wastewater treatment and invest in innovation 
for water management . Moreover , brands need 
to understand the context-based water risks 
along their supply chain , since in some locations 
there are systemic water challenges that create 
operational , reputational or regulatory risks for 
them and their suppliers . Water risks typically 
arise at the basin level . Creating or joining 
collective action at basin-level in high-risk basins 
helps to address these risks . With the water 
stewardship approach , stakeholders 
collaboratively seek to improve practices in key 
river basins . Joint private and public sector 
engagement drives stronger water management 
and governance beyond the company ’ s direct 
operations and value chain . 
4 . Raw materials . The production of raw materials 
for natural and synthetic fibres always has an 
impact on the environment . However , 
companies should analyse and measure this 
impact , which depends on the nature of the raw 
materials , location of production and production 
processes . Careful choice , design , as well as 
good sustainability standards and labels can 
reduce the environmental impacts of raw 
materials . Equally important is the absolute 
reduction of use of newly sourced raw materials , 
for example through repairing and recycling 
processes , improving the durability and longevity 
of garments , and reducing consumption . 
Companies should switch to 100 per cent 
sustainable materials with the lowest possible 
footprint . WWF ’ s sustainable cotton ranking
provides further information on major brands ’ 
shift and ambition for 100 per cent sustainable 
cotton . 
5 . Joint environmental management in the 
supply chain . Companies should take 
responsibility for all tiers of their supply chain , 
including raw materials and manufacturing . This 
is a challenge in the highly fragmented supply 
chain of the clothing and textile industry . WWF 
therefore highly recommends companies to seek

23
pre-competitive collaboration to tackle ‘ systemic ’ 
challenges in the industry . Pre-conditions to 
collaboration are transparency , openness to new 
ways of working and trust . Industry initiatives 
and platforms as well as standards and 
certification can foster collaboration . 
Cooperatively , the measurement and analysis of 
data , as well as the implementation of ecoefficiency programmes in supply chains , might 
become more feasible . 
6 . Chemicals management . Companies need to 
set up a strategy for managing chemicals within 
their supply chain and should aim for zero 
hazardous chemicals . This work can be guided 
by NGO or industry programmes , like the 
Greenpeace DETOX campaign or the Zero 
Discharge of Hazardous Chemicals ( ZDHC ) 
programme , which both work on the elimination 
of hazardous chemicals in the textile supply 
chain . Furthermore , the company ’ s commitment 
can be fostered by standards and certification 
bodies . Circular economy concepts such as 
Cradle to Cradle even go a step further ; they 
work on eliminating all chemicals that could be a 
problem in circular production chains , where 
end-of-life-products are directly reused as inputs 
for the next generation of materials . 
7 . Investments , stakeholder engagement and 
responsibility for public policy . Companies 
should increase transparency and take 
environmental responsibility within their full 
sphere of influence , including , but not limited to , 
their investments ( e . g . in capital goods and 
pension funds )  , their engagement in public 
affairs ( e . g . in their associations or by directly 
taking positions on public policy )  , and their 
engagement with stakeholders ( e . g . 
sustainability reporting )  . 
8 . New business models to decouple 
consumption from resource use . Considering 
the current environmental impact of the textile 
supply chain , it is unavoidable to discuss the 
necessity of decoupling consumption from 
resource use . This could be achieved by new 
business models , which reduce the speed and 
level of consumerism , and counter the emerging 
throwaway culture in the clothing and fashion 
industry . Brands could develop creative 
solutions for responsible marketing . 
Furthermore , product design should be based 
on insights of life-cycle analysis , and should aim 
for the garments ’ longevity and circularity . 
Further research and development should be 
conducted on transformational processes , 
products and even business models , which draw 
the industry away from the traditional linear 
model towards a more circular approach . 
WWF is looking to build a vision of the ideal action plan . Some of 
these actions will be feasible within the current operating system of the 
clothing and fashion industry . However , some will require transformational 
change , which could potentially disrupt current business models in the 
sector . The next chapter will look at how the clothing and textile sector 
could be transformed , beyond gradual efficiency improvements .

Why efficiencies 
alone will not suffice
To meet the challenges of the future , the sector needs to transform itself 
radically . Some frontrunners have already acknowledged this fact and 
have started creating innovative processes , products and business models 
that might enable these companies to drastically reduce their 
environmental footprint . 
Some companies have recognized and promote the innovation imperative . 
For example , Nike writes :  “ What becomes abundantly clear is efficiencies 
alone will not suffice – for Nike , or the world . The world needs systemic 
change at scale . We must innovate .  ” 
49 These innovations will be both 
technological and social . For companies , this even makes sense from a 
financial perspective : a recent study has shown that going beyond current 
solutions would be a business opportunity worth more than €80 billion . 50
Innovative business models need to take into account the limitations and 
carrying capacity of the planet . Materializing this quantum leap in the 
clothing and textile industry requires completely new ways of thinking . 
Questions in line of the following could and should be asked : 
WHAT IF dying did not require any water at all ? 
WHAT IF all fashion companies used 100 per cent recycled materials ? 
WHAT IF the clothing and textile industry emitted only very little greenhouse gas during the production process ? 
WHAT IF our clothes left no harmful traces ? 
WHAT IF clothing brands ensured that clothes have a second , third , fourth life by leasing them ? 
WHAT IF repairing and sharing created benefits for consumers and a business case for companies ? 
Searching for and promoting innovation to transform long-established , 
unsustainable business practices are essential . Some of the innovation 
stories WWF has found are summarized in this chapter . These innovations 
are driven by innovative start-ups , SMEs and leading brands .

BOX 4 : Process , product and business model innovations
Various studies distinguish between different forms and levels of innovation , such as process , product and 
business model innovation . 
Figure 9 : Three-level innovation framework : process , product , and business model innovations . 
51
Process innovation leads to manufacturing processes with a reduced environmental footprint , particularly 
regarding energy , GHG emissions , water and chemicals . Product innovation generates better products , e . g . 
through recycled content or certified raw materials and manufacturing . Process and product innovation often 
focus on improvements of the current system . In order to see radical transformation of the sector , process and 
product innovation will not suffice . What is needed , maybe most of all , is business model innovation . 
Business model innovation changes the way the business is done and value is created . Business models 
are the fundamental structures for how companies create , deliver and capture value . 
52 The aim of business 
model innovation from a sustainability perspective is to drastically reduce the resources and material input 
needed in the sector ’ s value chain , and to reduce the environmental impact of the sector ’ s activities . Even with 
transformed business models , companies should be able to deliver excellent service and cater to the needs of 
their customers . Sustainable business models should enable companies to operate within the ecological 
boundaries of our planet . The new models could follow the principles of sufficiency and / or circular economy . 
Sufficiency covers reductionist strategies such as consuming / producing less and slowing down . Circular economy looks at closed-loop systems , repairing and the sharing economy . Other business model innovations with
environmental benefits include 
• ‘ product as a service ’  ( e . g . renting instead of selling clothes ) 
• ‘ physical to virtual ’  ( replacing physical infrastructure such as retail stores with virtual services ) 
• ‘ produce on demand ’  ( producing clothes only when customer demand has been quantified ) 
• and ‘ re-materialization ’  ( sourcing materials from recovered waste )  .

Innovation stories in
the clothing and 
textile sector
The innovation stories listed below were selected based on their level of 
ambition in terms of reach , relevance , feasibility and scalability . Due to the 
variety and diversity of existing innovations , we do not claim to provide a 
complete picture . We describe concepts that are relevant to the
environmental impacts of the sector , that have been tested and already 
exist , and that might be brought to scale . 
The stories are structured according to the three-level-innovation 
framework explained in box 4 – even though it is not always easy to draw 
a strict line between process , product and business model innovation . 
Nevertheless , the stories falling under reducing , repairing , reusing / sharing 
as well as recycling / recycled fibres can be understood as part of business 
model innovation . These follow sufficiency and / or circularity principles 
and are thus the most far-reaching conceptual remodelling of the clothing 
and textile industry . More sustainable fibres fall predominantly under 
product innovation . These innovations , although equally important , do 
not aim to disrupt the current linear take-make-dispose model of the 
clothing and fashion industry . The final innovation stories – better 
processes – are process innovations , which aim to make transformative 
improvements to the current operating model of the clothing and textile 
industry . 
Business model innovation
Reducing
Don ’ t buy this jacket by Patagonia : in 2011 Patagonia started this campaign to remind its consumers to only buy 
stuff if they really needed it . While this can be seen as only a marketing campaign , it may point to new thinking in 
the industry . Patagonia made a business model out of this campaign by opening a second-hand store in 
collaboration with eBay . 
Repairing
Repair Truck and Worn Wear by Patagonia extends the campaign : Worn Wear celebrates the stories of the 
clothes worn by consumers , keeps gear in action longer through repair and reuse , and recycles garments when 
they ' re beyond repair . 
Repairing instruction by Vaude and Ifixit : Vaude and some other companies collaborate with the online repair 
service platform Ifixit to make repairing of garments at home easy . 
Nudie Jeans repair shops : Nudie Jeans offers repair shops at its stores and promotes repairing as a normal and 
important step along the consumer journey . 
Swedish government reduces tax on repairs to clothes : Not only companies can incentivize customers to 
bring back clothes for repairing , but governments can play a role too . To combat its ‘ throwaway consumer 
culture ’  , Sweden has announced tax breaks on repairs to clothes from 25 per cent to 12 per cent . 
Reusing and sharing
Yerdle Recommerce : Founded in 2012 as a California Benefit Corporation , Yerdle Recommerce provides 
logistics and technology that makes it easy for brands to buy back and resell their items . Levi ’ s , Patagonia and 
Eileen Fisher work with Yerdle to facilitate second-hand sales of their clothes . 
Filippa K has innovated its business model to ensure that its products receive a second or third life through 
reuse . The company has operated a profitable second-hand store in Stockholm since 2008 and has started to 
rent out clothes through its lease concept . 
walkincloset . ch , kleihd . ch in Zurich , renttherunway . com , sharewear . se and rentez-vous . com are examples 
of start-ups that offer sharing of clothes through clothes swaps or renting .

Recycling and recycled fibres
Specialized recycling companies such as I : CO and Tell-Tex collaborate with companies to collect clothing for 
reuse and recycling . 54
H & M aims to become 100 per cent circular by 2030 . H & M pledges to use 100 per cent recycled or sustainably 
sourced material by 2030 . The Global Change Award by H & M fosters several new tech solutions in line with 
recycling and circular economy . 
Fully biodegradable pants by Swiss brand Freitag : F-ABRIC textiles are 100 per cent naturally biodegradable –
including threads and selvage . A piece of clothing thus becomes fertile soil for new raw materials and the cycle 
continues . 
Recycled underwear collection by Swiss brand Odlo is 100 per cent recycled and 100 per cent recyclable . 
Transforming marine pollution into sportswear . adidas pledges to phase out virgin plastic from its production 
processes and works with Parley to the Oceans to invent products made from recycled plastic collected in marine 
environments . 
Nike Grind is a palette of premium recycled materials , which is already used in 71 per cent of Nike footwear and 
apparel products . Nike Grind is part of Nike ’ s work towards a closed-loop future . 
Cotton recycling / Re-looping fashion is re-producing old cotton clothing into new material , maintaining the 
quality of the re-produced fibres . The closed-loop value chain maintains the value of the material , eliminates 
waste and reduces water consumption . 
Product innovation
More sustainable fibres
Coop ’ s own brand Naturaline is 100 per cent certified organic cotton , certified Fairtrade , traceable right 
back to the farm and CO2 neutral . Unavoidable CO2 emissions are offset directly at the source . Together with 
the bioRe® Foundation , Coop has built 3 , 600 biogas plants and installed over 3 , 000 efficient ovens . 
100 per cent sustainable cotton . Large companies such as Ikea , C & A , H & M , Adidas and Nike recognize the 
environmental effects of cotton farming and have launched efforts to purchase only cotton from sustainable 
sources in the near future . 
Organic cotton accelerator was founded by C & A , H & M , Eileen Fisher , Kering and Inditex . It is a multistakeholder initiative that prototypes organic cotton acceleration projects , which should be ready for roll-out and 
scaling by 2018 . Currently , C & A is the world ’ s biggest purchaser of organic cotton . 55
Indian-based Chetna Coalition ( Chetco ) has established and maintained market access for thousands of farmers 
in India who produce organic-Fairtrade cotton . 
TENCEL® is a lyocell fibre from Lenzing , which is extracted from wood . The fibre production itself is eco-friendly 
due to the closed loop system .

Process innovation
Innovative processes
Climate positive value chain : H & M wants to make its value chain ( from cotton farms to customer ’ s washing 
machines ) climate positive by 2040 through energy-efficiency measures , promotion of renewable energy , climate 
resilience and carbon sinks . 
ColorDry by Nike is a technology that dyes fabric without water . ColorDry instead uses CO2 in the dyeing 
process . In FY15 , this facility saved 20 million litres of water in Nike ’ s supply chains . Other companies such as 
adidas and Levi ’ s also promote waterless dying . 56
The North Face ’ s popular Denali jacket is made of 100 per cent recycled materials and utilizes new dyeing
processes that use up to 50 per cent less water and chemicals . By using recycled plastics in the Denali , 30 
million plastic bottles are being kept out of landfill every year . 
Archroma Advanced Denim Technology by Patagonia is an innovative dye process that colours denim with 
sulphur dyestuffs that bond more easily . This results in much shorter production lines that use 84 per cent less 
water , 30 per cent less energy and emit 25 per cent less CO2 compared to conventional denim dyeing processes . 
The stories selected here reveal that the clothing and textile sector is 
working on potential transformations towards greater sustainability , even 
though few of them have been brought to scale nor have they transformed 
the industry . WWF trusts that the industry has the capability to take the 
necessary leadership , and will further invest in research and development , 
creativity and innovation to transform the sector and make it fundamentally 
better for the environment than it currently is . In support of the industry ' s 
transformational aspirations WWF Switzerland is piloting a strategic 
approach to business model innovation for sustainability in collaboration 
with corporate partners ( see box 5 )  . 
BOX 5 : Business model innovation for sustainability at WWF Switzerland
Megatrends as drivers . Scarce resources , climate change , digitalization , changing customer needs and demographic change are rapidly transforming our world . This challenges companies , as current business models are often no longer profitable . However , these challenges can also be seen as business opportunities . 
Pilot project for business model innovation . WWF Switzerland , Impact Hub Zurich and selected partner 
companies are currently piloting an approach to strategically develop new business models , which are not 
only profitable , but also contribute to solving global and industry-specific environmental challenges . In collaboration , WWF wants to set new impulses for an exponential transformation of sectors and markets towards 
more sustainability , and eventually towards operating the ecological boundaries of our planet . 
A lean , collaborative process . In a ‘ lean innovation process ’  , the partners are aiming to develop new 
business models . The goal of this process is to create minimum viable products for innovative business 
ideas , and to test and iterate them by seeking customer feedback . Innovation and transformation can be 
achieved more effectively through unconventional perspectives of the various stakeholders involved .

Finally , you and every consumer play an important role in transforming the 
clothing industry towards sustainability . WWF believes consumers have a 
crucial role to play , and offers six practical recommendations :  
( 1 ) Reduce ,  ( 2 ) Care and repair ,  ( 3 ) Reuse ,  ( 4 ) Recycle ,  ( 5 ) Buy 
mindfully , and ( 6 ) Use your voice ! 
Figure 10 : How consumers can contribute to a more sustainable clothing and textile industry
Reduce Buy less . Of course , we like to buy new items from time to time . But we 
have so much stuff we don ’ t need , and mostly we wear the same few 
clothes from our closet . On average , each person in OECD countries buys 
20kg of clothing per year . 57 A study in the UK found that there are 3 . 6 
billion items of clothing left unworn in wardrobes – 57 items per person in 
Great Britain . 58 So , if you want to buy a piece , please ask yourself whether 
you really need it . Because buying less is not only good for the 
environment , but also helps you save money and time . 
Simplify your style , dress your personality . Fashion is a great way to 
dress your personality . WWF suggests using timeless , high-quality clothes 
instead of buying several new items too often . The marketing expert 
Sheena Matheiken showed in the Uniform Project™ (  box 6 ) how easy it 
is to wear just a single dress and enrich it with accessories and secondhand items . 
Simplify your wardrobe . Have a look at your wardrobe and clean from it 
all the pieces you haven ’ t worn in the past year . There is a lot of guidance 
on how to simplify your wardrobe . Many people who have followed the 
advice of Marie Kondo , bestselling author of Magic Cleaning , have found 
that decluttering a wardrobe can even be “ life-changing ”  . This of course 
only works if we do not fill the emptied shelves with new clothes . 
BOX 6 : Uniform Project™ -1 dress , 365 days
The Uniform Project started in 2009 when a young woman realized she was drowning in the doldrums of an 
uninspired advertising career . Creatively and ethically drained by the corporate world , she came up with an 
unusual creative challenge : to wear the same dress for an entire year – but , and this is where the real challenge came in , she ’ d have to make it look unique every single day . She also vowed to make the challenge 
more meaningful by turning it into a fundraiser to send less fortunate kids to school .

Care and repair Wash and care . One-third of the carbon footprint of the life of a garment 
occurs during the use phase – through washing , drying and ironing the 
clothes . 59 By not using the tumble dryer you can save around 10 per cent 
of the total carbon footprint and a lot of water – plus your clothes live 
longer . Washing your clothes less often and at lower temperatures can 
also reduce their carbon and water footprint significantly . 60 And did you 
know that many Japanese and Chinese wash their laundry cold ? This is 
why the footprint in their use phase is very small , compared to people in 
Europe and North America . 61
Repair your clothes . More and more people want to work with their own 
hands . If you like craftsmanship ( or craftswomanship )  , consider repairing 
your clothes . The company Patagonia ’ s Worn Wear campaign tells stories 
to motivate customers to start repairing their clothes . 62 There are also 
more and more repair cafes or sewing shops that offer a space , sewing 
machines and support . For instance , the NGO Social Fabric in Zurich 
rents out sewing spaces . There are also repair cafes in many cities . 
Meanwhile , tailors offer their services at surprisingly moderate prices . In 
many cities , you will also find workshops for clothes design and 
manufacturing , or you can get guidance on YouTube and other online 
sources .

Reuse Buy second-hand clothes . Extending the ( used ) life of clothes overall 
has the largest potential of lowering the environmental footprint of 
clothing . 63 An easy way to extend the use phase of clothes – apart from 
using them longer yourself – is to donate them to charities , or sell them on 
flea markets or online platforms such as Kleiderkreisel . de or ricardo . ch . 
Rent your outfits . If you rent your clothes you will share your outfits with 
others and thereby prolong the life of a garment . This potentially reduces 
the need to manufacture new clothes . Examples of renting and shared 
wardrobes are kleihd . ch in Zurich , renttherunway . com , sharewear . se
and rentez-vous . com . 
Swap your clothes . More recently , swapping online platforms like 
swishing . co . uk and local swapping parties have become popular . It is 
easy to organize a clothes swap with your friends or at work . WWF 
Switzerland regularly organizes clothes swaps in its cafeteria . Host a 
clothes swap party yourself ( see box 7 ) or simply go to a clothes swap that 
is organized ( semi- ) professionally , like the walkincloset . ch . 
Recycle Do not throw your clothes into the rubbish bin – even if your clothes 
are broken and cannot be repaired anymore . Companies that collect 
clothes are experts in recycling them . They will define whether your 
donated clothes can be reused , partly recycled , or whether they need to 
be downcycled , shredded into pieces and used for insulation in the 
construction sector , for example . 
BOX 7 : How to organize a clothes swap party
1 . Invite your friends or colleagues to your clothes swap . 
2 . You will need a space to display / hang up the clothes and a changing room ( e . g . a washroom ) 
3 . Everyone brings as many unused fashion items ( e . g . clothes , accessories ) as they want . 
4 . All fashion items are displayed in one location ( no name tags , no price tags are needed )  . 
5 . Everyone is free to pick as many items as they want , for free . 
6 . Leftover clothes can be donated to a charity . 
It ’ s a great way to get new clothes ( for free ) and give a new life to items you no longer use .

Buy mindfully Buy organic and green . There are several standards and labels in the 
clothing and textile industry . WWF particularly recommends buying 
sustainable cotton , including organic cotton , Fairtrade cotton , Cotton made 
in Africa and Better Cotton . You can check WWF ’ s sustainable cotton 
ranking or siegelklarheit . de for more information on sustainable labels 
and standards . Swiss and international brands and retailers such as Coop , 
Migros and H & M , but also smaller companies , offer their own branded 
ecological collections , and there are other companies that make being 
green a central part of their business . The website Getchanged . net
reveals a large collection of fashion brands that produce according to high 
ecological standards . 
Buy wisely . If you buy new clothes , prefer high-quality basics made by 
responsible brands . You can mix these basics with your swapped , rented 
or second-hand accessories and fashion items . Consider that trends 
usually do not last that long , and question whether you must follow all 
trends . 
Use your voice Address the topic with your friends and colleagues . Inform your 
colleagues about the negative impact of clothing and textile companies on 
the environment and discuss potential solutions and actions you can take . 
Contact your preferred fashion brand . Send companies your positive or 
negative feedback on their sustainability performance . If your preferred 
label does not provide green collections , or does not transparently 
communicate their environmental and social performance , voice your 
concern to the company . 
Vote for a sustainable transformation of the economy . Particularly in a 
direct democracy such as Switzerland your vote for a sustainable 
transformation of the economy counts . WWF Switzerland regularly 
publishes recommendations on how to vote on certain topics , including 
issues such as green economy . 
Support non-governmental organizations . Consider supporting the 
work of WWF or other NGOs engaged in the fashion industry . WWF 
strategically approaches the textile and other industries with the aim to 
move companies ’ performances towards sustainability . You can support 
the work of WWF as a volunteer , with a donation and much more .

Discussion of the rating results
The findings of the rating are discussed and elaborated in more detail below . 
Environmental policy and management systems
In this section , oekom research AG analyses whether the company has a comprehensive environmental policy , 
which regulates the active management of environmental performance , the responsible and efficient use of 
natural resources , as well as the prevention and minimization of environmental impacts . It also looks at how 
environmental management is being implemented and enforced through structures and responsibilities , 
environmental programmes , target setting , environmental training , a data compilation system , environmental 
audits and adherence to environmental management standards . 
Discussion : The results show that Hugo Boss and adidas outperform the 
other companies in this aspect . These companies have a formal 
commitment , which covers all relevant parts of their operations . They have 
clear management structures in place , which allows them to measure their 
environmental impacts and set targets accordingly . Furthermore , their 
management systems adhere to an internationally recognized standard 
such as ISO 14001 and are certified against these criteria . 
H & M , Nike , Mammut , VF and Triumph are in the midfield for this criterion . 
These companies do have reasonable policies and systems in place , but 
have received a lower grade , for example , due to the lack of information 
on management structures and responsibilities , or due to missing external 
certification of their management systems . 
Five out of twelve analysed companies do not ( yet ) have a formal and 
transparent approach to environmental management policies and 
systems . These companies provide no or very limited information on their 
commitment to environmental issues , and entirely lack the means to 
measure and manage their environmental impacts .

37
Climate change strategy
In this section , oekom research AG analyses whether the company takes a public position on climate change and 
acknowledges its own responsibility towards climate protection . It also looks at the scope and activities covered 
by greenhouse gas inventories , as well as the disclosure of calculation method and level of external assurance . It 
Furthermore , it evaluates greenhouse gas reduction targets and action plans , as well as the disclosure of climate 
change risks and mitigation strategies . 
Discussion : Large companies such as H & M , Nike , adidas , VF Corp and 
Hugo Boss clearly acknowledge climate change , state their commitment to 
reduce greenhouse gas emissions , and measure and reduce scope 1 and 
2 greenhouse gas emissions . These companies also disclose and have 
started to manage risks related to climate change such as disruption of 
global logistics chains through extreme weather events , decrease in the 
availability of raw materials ( e . g . cotton ) due to climate change , rising 
costs for energy , water and raw materials , and other risks . 
The majority of the companies surveyed in this rating have taken no or 
very limited steps to implement greenhouse gas inventories , to set 
reduction targets , and to take action against global warming as an 
integrated part of their sustainability management . 
Travel and transport
This section analyses efficient transport logistics , modes of transportation , and business travel . The criteria cover
the companies ’ measures to reduce business travel and offset emissions and to increase the efficiency of 
transport logistics , as well as their use of different modes of transportation such as air , road , train and ship . 
Discussion : Mammut is the only company performing in the ‘ ambitious ’ 
category for this criterion . Mammut uses a system consisting of efficient 
distribution centres in combination with route planning . 
Companies in the ‘ ambitious ’ and ‘ midfield ’ performance level use 
environmentally favourable modes of transportation such as ship and rail 
instead of air and road in a strategic way . However , none of the 
companies strategically uses other measures such as demand and supply 
planning or improved load capacity to decrease environmental impacts of 
transport
Environmental management in the supply chain 
Regarding environmental management in the supply chain , oekom research AG looks at the content , bindingness 
and coverage of environmental supplier standards . It also looks at procedures to ensure compliance with the 
environmental supplier standard , such as assessment of environmental risks in the supply chain , training of key 
suppliers , supplier audits , procedures and reporting in case of environmental non-compliance and training of 
employees in purchasing departments . 
Discussion : H & M , adidas and Mammut have taken ambitious and even 
visionary ( H & M ) measures to improve environmental management in the 
supply chain . The supplier standard of these companies refers to the 
implementation of an environmental management system and requires the 
supplier to systematically manage their environmental impact . The supplier 
standard is binding and needs to be signed by suppliers . In some cases , 
the supplier standard requires suppliers to extend the standard to their 
suppliers . These companies also conduct detailed risk assessments , audit 
their suppliers with regards to the environmental performance and define 
corrective action plans . Furthermore , they train staff in the purchasing 
department on the company ’ s environmental supplier standard . H & M and 
Changing fashion : The clothing and textile industry at the brink of radical transformation
Environmental rating and innovation report by WWF Switzerland 2017 September 2017
38
adidas also regularly conduct trainings and re-audits to support their 
suppliers and to check the progress of implementation of corrective action 
plans . 
Another five of the surveyed companies have some environmental 
management concerning their suppliers in place , and another four have 
established very few or no measures . Data provided by oekom research 
AG has shown that all companies in the lower midfield or 
intransparent / latecomers category for this criterion perform better in 
adherence to labour standards and acceptable working conditions of their 
suppliers , but clearly underperform in terms of environmental management 
in their supply chain . 
Use of environmentalassessment tools in product design 
This section analyses the measures taken by the company to use environmental assessment tools in product 
design in order to minimize the environmental impact of products throughout their life-cycle . This can be done on 
a company-level , or as part of an industry initiative . 
Discussion : Nike is the only company analysed that has taken a visionary 
approach on this criterion . oekom research AG comments on Nike ’ s 
approach as follows :  “ Comprehensive measures have been taken to use 
environmental assessment tools in product design to minimise the 
environmental impact of products throughout their life cycle . The company 
reports on its own sustainability index for both shoes and apparel . It 
includes energy use , GHG emissions , waste , water and chemistry . Details 
on the methodology , including lifecycle steps , and external verification are 
provided . The index is used as a decision-making tool which can be used 
to score new designs . Nike states that it provides its product creation 
teams with training in how to use the indexes and on the importance of
focusing on the sustainability of materials . The teams are given scoring 
targets for each season of products they design . In addition , the company 
has developed a scoring system for its new products . It has set overall 
targets and publishes the summary of the results on its website .  ” 
Data indicates that H & M , adidas and Hugo Boss use some environmental 
assessment tools in product design . Measures taken include conducting 
life-cycle assessments and establishing databases on environmental 
aspects of materials and processes to support the design teams with facts . 
H & M and adidas state that they are members of the Sustainable Apparel 
Coalition and support the development of the Higg Index , which measures 
sustainability impacts along the product life-cycle . Having said this , the 
results also show that most of the companies analysed take no or very 
limited action in this regard . 
Raw materials
This section looks at the company ’ s action concerning cotton , leather and environmentally preferable materials . In 
terms of cotton , oekom research AG analyses the company ’ s policy on the use of genetically modified cotton , the 
strategy to ensure sourcing of cotton from sustainable cultivation , and the percentage of certified organic cotton 
used in textiles . The criteria also cover the company ’ s strategy to ensure sourcing of hides from sustainable 
farming for leather production , and the company ’ s strategy to increase the use of environmentally preferable 
materials . Furthermore , major controversies relating to raw materials are analysed .

Environmental rating and innovation report by WWF Switzerland 2017 September 2017
39
Discussion : The four leaders in this rating – H & M , Nike , adidas and 
Mammut – outperform the other companies regarding raw materials . The 
majority of the analysed companies take no or very limited action 
concerning more sustainable raw materials . 
Companies that perform well purchase a high percentage of organic 
and / or more sustainable cotton , and have set ambitious targets to 
substantially increase the sourcing of more sustainable cotton in the near 
future . Some companies support initiatives such as the Better Cotton 
Initiative ( BCI ) or the Organic Cotton Accelerator ( OCA )  . Furthermore , the 
better performing companies have set a strategy to increase the use of 
environmentally preferable material such as recycled materials . Finally , 
companies have taken measures to ensure their leather does not come 
from 
cattle ranches that have been involved in deforestation in the Amazon , 
such as the implementation of traceability systems or participation in 
industry initiatives such as the Leather Working Group . 
Water use and hazardous substances in manufacturing
In this part , oekom research AG analyses the companies ’ measures to manage water use in their supply chain , 
including water policy , measures to ensure sustainable water use in manufacturing , strategy and measures to 
eliminate hazardous substances from wastewater streams , as well as major controversies relating to water use in 
manufacturing . Furthermore , the company ’ s strategy to restrict and reduce the use of hazardous substances in 
manufacturing , as well as controversies relating to hazardous substances , is analysed . Analysis of controversies 
is based on external information such as academia / research and NGOs . 
Discussion : H & M outperforms the other companies in regard to the 
management of water use and hazardous substances in manufacturing . 
Another five companies are in the upper midfield relating to manufacturing . 
Half of the analysed companies take no or very little action concerning 
environmental issues of manufacturing . 
Companies performing well report in detail on e . g . water risk assessments , 
implementation of water saving technologies , requirements for and 
auditing and support of suppliers , optimization of products and cooperation 
with stakeholders such as NGOs . Nike and H & M assess their supply chain 
against country- and basin-level water risk data , acknowledging that basinlevel information is more important and valuable than national-level data . 
Mammut , Calida and Odlo work with suppliers that are certified against 
standards like bluesign , which are concerned with the reduction of water 
consumption , reusing cooling water , installing closed water circuits , 
chemicals management , wastewater treatment , and hazardous 
substances management . 
Better-performing companies have also taken reasonable measures to 
restrict and reduce hazardous substances in manufacturing . Measures 
taken include a manufacturing restricted substances list , reduction targets 
and outphasing timelines , positive lists for the substitution of hazardous 
substances , regular supplier audits and capacity building , development of 
innovative production processes using less hazardous chemicals , and 
cooperation with industry stakeholders on chemical safety . For instance , 
adidas , Nike and H & M have made a commitment to zero discharge of 
hazardous chemicals by 2020 . Mammut has set a target of switching all 
waterproofing treatments for its clothing range to PFC-free alternatives by 
2022 . adidas also reports on new dying processes that require up to 50 
per cent less chemicals .

In this section , oekom research AG analyses policies and measures with regard to environmental management of 
retail stores . In particular , guidelines and measures regarding energy efficiency and use of energy from renewable 
sources , as well as certifications for environmental design , green building standards and environmental 
management of retail locations , are taken into account . This section is only applicable if retail stores account for a 
considerable part of the surveyed company ’ s environmental impact . 
Discussion : H & M , Nike and adidas have taken some measures to 
improve energy efficiency in heating , cooling , ventilation and lighting 
and / or to increase the use of renewable energy sources . Both companies 
use energy management systems and set targets to reduce electricity use . 
Nike has received certifications for environmental design and 
management for a small percentage of total floor space of its stores . 
Furthermore , Nike reports that it regularly holds building design workshops 
for Nike retail operations to help embed sustainability into design and 
construction of new facilities . adidas reports that it has a store manual that 
includes a separate section on environmental aspects . The manual shares 
best practices and acts as a guidance tool for the local architects when 
they build new stores . 
However , these three better-performing companies do not disclose 
information on whether the company has a systematic approach to energy 
efficiency in heating , cooling , ventilation and lighting , for example through 
natural ventilation , heat recovery in air ventilation , green roofs , or 
combined heat and power . None of the other companies are committed to 
systematic management of the environmental impact of their retail stores . 
The few stores of Mammut and Odlo do not account for a considerable 
part of these two companies ’ environmental impact . This criterion was 
therefore not applicable to Mammut and Odlo . 
Eco-efficiency
This unit looks at the measurement of eco-efficiencies of the surveyed companies ’ own operations , retail stores , 
as well as own and outsourced production and transport . This includes the energy intensity , water intensity , and 
greenhouse gas emission intensity . Furthermore , the total amount of waste generated , as well as waste intensity , 
are being considered . Intensity is measured against product item , if available , and otherwise against net sales . 
Also , the total amount of waste generated is considered . In addition , the trend of energy , water , greenhouse gas 
emissions and waste intensity over the last years is evaluated . 
Discussion : Eight out of twelve analysed companies are evaluated as 
 ‘ intransparent / latecomers ’  , four are in the midfield , and none of them is 
above midfield . The eight ‘ intransparent / latecomers ’ companies do not 
report any or very limited eco-efficiency data for their own operations and 
supply chain . These results show that the majority of companies / brands in 
the clothing and textile industry do not systematically collect relevant and 
useful eco-efficiency data in the supply chain beyond their own operations . 
Stakeholder engagement , human rights , community involvement and public policy influence
This section covers the company ’ s stakeholder dialogue , including their sustainability reporting , reporting quality 
and assurance of reporting . Furthermore , the section covers the company ’ s commitment to human rights , 
including major controversies relating to human rights . In this section , oekom research AG also look at the 
company ’ s community involvement activities . In addition , the section analyses the companies ’ transparency and 
disclosure in regard to their relations with governments , political contributions and lobbying activities .

Discussion : H & M , Mammut , Nike , adidas and Hugo Boss outperform the 
other companies regarding stakeholder engagement , human rights , 
community involvement and public policy influence . Companies that 
perform well in this section have put in place a sustainability reporting 
system which covers various relevant sustainability issues such as supply 
chain management , environmental management , product responsibility , 
industry-specific environmental impacts as well as social impacts . H & M 
and Hugo Boss are the only companies with limited assurance of their 
sustainability reporting ; the other companies have no assurance . 
Companies performing better in this section have made a formal 
commitment to respect human rights , and have taken a strategic approach 
to community involvement , charitable giving and employee volunteering . 
None of the companies analysed transparently and proactively disclose 
their contributions to governments and / or lobbying activities to influence 
public policy . Some companies such as Triumph , adidas , Hugo Boss and 
Mammut state that political contributions are prohibited . 
Customer and product responsibility
This section covers various topics related to customers such as substances of concern in products and animal 
welfare . Furthermore , these criteria look at the company ’ s strategy on sustainable product portfolio , including 
longevity and recyclability of products , but also customer awareness-raising activities and measures to promote 
more sustainable products and services . 
Discussion : H & M , adidas , Mammut , Hugo Boss , Calida and Triumph 
perform better than the other surveyed companies in these criteria . 
Another three companies are in the midfield , and only three companies 
are in the intransparent category . 
Companies that perform well in regard to customer and product 
responsibility provide a detailed list which restricts the content of 
substances of concern in finished garments sold to consumers , leather 
products and shoes , and conducts reasonable monitoring regarding this 
issue . Some companies such as Triumph , adidas and Mammut meet or 
exceed the Oeko-Tex 100 standard and use external certification by OekoTex 100 and bluesign , or external laboratories for monitoring . 
Furthermore , companies such as H & M exclude the sale of furs and leather 
which is not a by-product of meat production and exclude the sale of raw 
materials coming from protected animal species . 
Some of the groups ’ brands offer a lifetime warranty , or have taken first 
steps to upcycle used products . However , none of the companies offer a 
comprehensive strategy on longevity and recyclability of products , which 
would for example include a commitment regarding durability , reparability 
and recyclability of products , timelessness of design , specific principles in 
design guidelines , comprehensive repair services and implementation of 
closed-loop recycling systems . 
All surveyed companies except Chicorée , Nike , Triumph and PKZ Group 
have taken some measures to increase customer awareness on 
sustainability impacts of products during their life-cycle ( e . g . customer 
information on how to reduce environmental impacts during the use 
phase )  . 
Some companies such as adidas and Mammut also encourage their 
customers to reduce , reuse and recycle . Furthermore , half of the surveyed 
companies take reasonable measures to promote more sustainable 
products and services .

Deep-dive into the political engagement of companies in Switzerland
Due to its expertise and experience in political processes in Switzerland , WWF has conducted its own rating for 
political engagement of companies in Switzerland . This analysis has been conducted by WWF Switzerland in 
addition to data provided by oekom research AG . The following results did not influence the result of the 
environmental rating , which was solely based on data provided by oekom research AG . 
To assess the engagement of clothing and textile companies surveyed in environmental policy debates in 
Switzerland , we looked at their direct and indirect ( i . e . via their business associations ) engagement in key 
industry-relevant environmental policies and pre-parliamentary initiatives in the period between 2011 and 2016 . 
This concerned 11 different political issues in the fields of energy , climate , transportation and economic policy . 
All surveyed companies are in the lower midfield in WWF ’ s rating of their political engagement . The 
analysis of the results shows that many of the clothing and textile companies in question do not engage actively in 
public policy . Instead , they back the positions of their associations . The associations sometimes advocate and at 
other times oppose key environmental interests , but in many cases , they do not take any position at all despite
political relevance for their members . 
Calida Group and Mammut are rated slightly lower than the others due to their membership of the Swiss Textiles 
association . Swiss Textiles actively lobbied against the revision of the Environmental Protection Act , which led to 
negative points in our rating . These negative points were partly compensated by Swiss Textiles ’ advocacy for the 
revision of the CO2 regulation after 2020 and the positive evolution of their position on the Energy Strategy 2050 . 
All other companies are not members of any association that does political lobbying in Switzerland . Furthermore , 
the results have shown that none of the companies take any political action in Switzerland themselves . This 
widespread political inactivity is surprising , particularly since the companies were directly influenced by the public 
policies analysed by WWF-Switzerland . 
WWF is convinced that public policy sets a framework for sustainable industries and economy and thereby 
creates a level playing field . We recommend that companies take the following actions : 
Membership in associations . Carefully assess company membership in associations . Even though reasons for 
membership can be manifold , companies need to be aware that most associations are politically active . 
Companies can support their associations in public affairs and influence their association ’ s political positions . 
Political action . Act as an individual company to improve and support environmental policies . This can be done 
by , for example , informing the members of parliament about their support or publicly speaking out in favour of 
environmental policies . 
Collaboration and exchange . Maintain an exchange on environmental policy with WWF Switzerland or other 
relevant organizations . WWF Switzerland regularly shares its public policy recommendations , as well as detailed
background information , with interested stakeholders .
